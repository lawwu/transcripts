[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   Now, before we get into those two parts, though, I'd like to start the shows when possible
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.200]   reacting to what's going on in the news. Uh, in particular, I have an article I want to talk
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.120]   about that we didn't really get around to talking on the last episode, but we should have because
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.240]   it's by me. So when I publish new things, especially new things in the New Yorker,
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.440]   I like to try to discuss them on the show in a little bit more depth, let you know what I'm
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.520]   thinking, maybe give you some more angles on it. So a couple of weeks ago, I published my latest
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.240]   for the New Yorker. It's titled Tik Tok and the fall of the social media giants. If you are
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.800]   watching this episode instead of just listening. So if you're at youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.680]   you'll see the article on your screen as well. Now, why I thought it was important to talk about
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.600]   this topic is not that I haven't talked about it before on the show, but because of the opposite
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   of that, I've talked about this topic a lot on the show. That's kind of what makes this cool for us.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.600]   This is one of the first instances, I would say, of an idea whose birth was this podcast.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.000]   I began bouncing these ideas around here with you, my listeners, and it evolved into a more
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.120]   polished form, the New Yorker. So here we are, Deep Questions podcast impacting the world of
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.120]   news. So you've heard these ideas before, but they're a lot more polished now. So let's go
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:28.320]   through it quickly. So I begin the article quoting Blake Chanley, Tik Tok's president of
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.720]   Global Business Solutions, talking about competition from Facebook. This is where he
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.360]   said, look, we're not worried. Facebook is a social platform built on a social graph. Tik
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.760]   Tok is an entertainment platform. These are two different things. Zuckerberg needs to stay in his
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.000]   lane. We have our own lane. That name should sound familiar. Blake Chanley, I talked about
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.480]   him on the show because I discovered this interview from one of you, my listeners, sent it
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.400]   to me at my interesting@calnewport.com email address. So then I went deeper into this.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:07.040]   So here's the next point I want to make. So in the article, I make this point that Facebook
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.320]   is trying to shift to be more like Tik Tok. Instagram, owned by the same company, shifting
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.480]   to be more like Tik Tok. And the way they are doing this is by moving towards video,
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   moving towards short video, but most importantly, as I'll soon elaborate,
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.160]   moving towards recommendations that have nothing to do with the social graph, moving towards feeds
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.280]   that are generated purely by algorithms, not by who you follow, not by people you know,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:45.520]   sharing it. So here's the quote from the article. This shift is not surprising, given Tik Tok's
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.440]   phenomenal popularity, and it has been very successful, but it's also short sighted.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.920]   So the whole thesis of the article is the following. I say, platforms like Facebook
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.760]   could be doomed if they fail to maintain the social graphs upon which they built their kingdoms.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.960]   So this is the setup to this whole article. Tik Tok's really popular. Companies like,
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.840]   platforms like Facebook, I should say, are trying to be more Tik Tok like,
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:22.400]   to stave off the competition and try to have faster user growth. This could, however, doom them.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.000]   All right, so let me elaborate this argument. What I'm getting at in this,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.520]   the original take on this point is there's real advantages to having an online company like
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.000]   Facebook or Instagram, or as you'll see, Twitter, that relies on a social graph.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.560]   And to be clear, by social graph, I mean, all of these individual friend requests,
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.200]   all these individual follow clicks, this topology of connections that human users built up,
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.920]   click by click, decision by decision over months and months and years and years of use,
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.080]   these really rich networks, these give a real advantage to the early mover platforms who have
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.840]   built them up. One is a network effect advantage. So I'm highlighting these here.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:17.520]   So I mentioned, for example, once Facebook had 100 million followers, active users, I should say,
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.960]   which it got by 2006, it became hard for anyone else to compete on a model of the people you know
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.200]   are here. And so you can see what the people you know are up to. Once you have 100 million users
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.520]   on one platform, how do you start from scratch and say, well, we only have 10,000, but we're growing.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.680]   So that's a huge network effect advantage. There are also other advantages to these topologies.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.320]   I talk a little bit in this article about the introduction of the retweet button to Twitter.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.160]   I think people don't understand the degree to which the introduction of the retweet button
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.160]   not only made Twitter into a lasting company of cultural influence, but also
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.760]   really transformed social media. So here's what happened when they introduced the retweet button.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:04.560]   The friction required to send a link or tweet to your entire follower base went down to almost
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.320]   nothing. Before we had the retweet button, people in Twitter would have to copy tweets and they would
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.760]   put RT. So you remember this, if you're old enough, you would put RT in caps colon, and then you would
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.840]   quote, just copy and paste quote, the tweet that you're retweeting. And then you would put at the
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.320]   original person who retweeted it below it. That's a pain. Retweet button, you see something you like,
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.800]   click a button and it spreads. That reduction in friction made all of the difference. It unlocked
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:42.000]   what I call a fierce viral dynamic. So now a tweet that was catching the attention of the zeitgeist
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.560]   in the right way, could spread through the power law topology of the Twitter social graph at
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.360]   frightening speed. Tens of millions, hundreds of millions of people could see something within
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.360]   an hour or two. And this all was based off these individual user decisions to retweet or not
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.520]   retweet. They see it from a few people, they retweet it. This turned out to have two hugely
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.200]   powerful effects. One, it attracted more interesting people to platforms like Twitter,
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.400]   because there's potential here. You had the potential of reaching millions of people if
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.880]   what you wrote caught on just right. So now more interesting people came to Twitter. That's another
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.000]   big network effect advantage. If all of the interesting people are on Twitter, when a
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.080]   competitor came along like Parler or Gab, they didn't do as well because there wasn't as many
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.400]   interesting people on there saying interesting things. Perhaps more important, these fierce
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.720]   viral dynamics also gave way to a frighteningly effective distributed curation mechanism.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.880]   So what happened is all these individual decisions that are tweet and retweet,
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:54.480]   created this human powered curation algorithm that was really, really good at figuring out
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.160]   what's the most interesting, controversial, outrageous, funny, off the wall, but perfect
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.800]   meme, whatever it was. It did a really good job of selecting for these things and amplifying it
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.000]   so millions of people could see. So that was very effective. So suddenly Twitter not only had
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.560]   interesting people on there, but it had this really good human powered curation, distributed
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.160]   curation algorithm that meant when you went on Twitter, you were going to see interesting things
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.200]   or funny things or outrageous things. And again, this is not sophisticated machine learning
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.760]   algorithms at play here. This is just the epiphenomenon of a lot of individuals clicking
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:35.200]   retweet or not. That's very powerful. So then as I get into it, Facebook noticed this retweet thing
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:42.000]   is working. So then by 2012, we get a share button added to the mobile app of Facebook.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.120]   It's exactly retweet. They too wanted to take advantage of that distributed curation.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.080]   All right, so here's my summary. Both Facebook and Twitter are built on the same general model
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.960]   of leveraging hard to replicate large social graphs to generate a never ending stream of
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.320]   engaging content. A strategy that proved to be robust in the face of new competition and
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.320]   incredibly lucrative. So it's the social graphs and those three advantages I just summarized,
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.400]   the people you know are on there, the interesting people are on there, and you have the distributed
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.000]   curation effect of the share and retweets. That made the small number of companies who got there
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.080]   first. Facebook, Instagram, Instagram, I took this out of the article, but I had a piece in there
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:30.080]   before about how Instagram basically, they were able to make a run at the castle that Facebook
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.200]   was building, because Facebook didn't understand image. And Instagram made it much easier to have
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:41.200]   these beautiful images filtered, perfectly sized for iPhones. That was so powerful, that media,
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.120]   that they were able to build a new audience from scratch before Facebook squashed that by buying
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.440]   them. So you have Facebook, you have Instagram, you have Twitter, these big social graphs that
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.720]   can produce a non-stop stream of engaging content of a style that no one else can compete with.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:01.840]   So if I want to go start my own social network tomorrow, to compete with those giants doing
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:08.480]   their same game, as many pretenders to the throne have encountered in the past five to 10 years,
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.000]   good luck. Because until I can get a hundred million people, including a lot of people you
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.200]   know, and a lot of really interesting people with all these intricate friend and follower
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.600]   connections that allow retweets and shares to become a really effective distributed curation
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.720]   mechanism, until that's all there, this is useless. It's not that interesting. I'd rather
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.720]   just go on Twitter. I'd rather go on Facebook. I'd rather go on Instagram. So they had this
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:38.720]   readout, this digital readout that was almost impossible for anyone to raid. And so that's
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:45.120]   why these pseudo monopolies grew bigger. It's why their influence on our culture became stronger.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.400]   It's why we began to get really worried starting around 2016, 2017, about just how much power
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.280]   these small number of companies had because they were immune to competition. And in my opinion,
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:03.600]   we're strangling the potential of the interactive web 2.0 by taking the democratic weirdness of the
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:10.160]   internet, the distributed homespun eccentricities of the internet and capturing it all into a small
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:19.040]   number of walled gardens. All right. Then you get tick tock and tick tock is the, is the weird night
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:25.200]   that came out of the bog that suddenly threatening all the castles. It's the, I don't know game of
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   thrones well, but the, uh, the woman with the dragons who comes out of nowhere and suddenly
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:37.120]   the Lannisters. Do I have the right chest? I don't know. I don't know. Game of thrones. I
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.320]   don't know, but there's, you know, there's these people in charge and then there's this,
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.640]   this woman who had dragons and kind of came out of nowhere and tick tock was tick tock is that.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:51.360]   Um, okay. So why is this the second part of my article? So what I, the case I make is the
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.640]   effectiveness of the tick tock experience is found in what it doesn't require. So tick tocks
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.200]   brilliance. Is it, it's the same sort of user generated content to stretch and experience,
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.520]   but it does not leverage a social graph. And this was the point that Blake Shanley was making in
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.560]   that very important interview. It tick tock does not care if people, you know, are on tick tock,
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.840]   tick tock does not care if famous people are on tick tock, tick tock does not care who you follow
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.960]   or what you can share. There are some social features in tick tock. No one uses them. It is
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:28.000]   purely algorithmic. It looks at the total pool of available videos. And by they, I mean, this.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.440]   Brutally effective machine learning loop and says, what should I show you next? What should I show
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.280]   you next? And as far as I can tell, I really went deep into this. I tried to understand what was
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.520]   happening with this algorithm. It's all proprietary, but there is some hints. I think the best hints
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.880]   probably come from the wall street journal, which did a big study where they created hundreds.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.400]   Well, I should speak the New York, New York, New York fact checker corrected on the, on this
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:58.720]   more than a hundred fake accounts, um, which they, they tweaked very carefully and observed to try
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.840]   to understand how the recommendations were happening and what, what seems to be happening
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:07.440]   with the, the tech talk algorithm is that it's, it's a, for you statistical optimizational people,
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:14.640]   it's essentially a stochastic multi-arm bandit reinforcement optimization machine learning loop.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.960]   So go look that up if you want to bore yourself. But what it does is it's showing you a lot of
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.240]   different things at first, somewhat randomly. And the main thing it looks at is how long did
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:29.360]   you watch the video before you swiped up to the next one? That is its best indication of the
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:35.280]   rewards you got from that video. It then uses statistically shows you statistically similar
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:40.560]   videos to that one. And again, it's trying to optimize, Hey, this one that's in the same
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.120]   universe you watched even longer. So let's, let's focus in on this as a constellation of type of
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:50.480]   videos you like. That's basically it. Plus some careful tuning about novelty to make sure that,
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.680]   you know, you're, you're being exposed to different things. You have a chance for your
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.720]   interest to wander. It's not super complicated, but within as short as 40 minutes, this is what
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:05.280]   the wall street journey found. It took about 40 minutes until the experience was almost eerie.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:11.120]   How well this machine learning loop had honed in on a small number of types of videos that really
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:19.920]   push your proverbial buttons. So it's not evil genius. You know, how from the movie 2001 is
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.320]   sitting in a hollowed out volcano somewhere where we're light years ahead. It's actually a pretty
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.520]   simple machine learning loop, but no social graph. Just we need a bunch of videos. Anyone
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.360]   can create videos. It doesn't matter if they're famous. It doesn't matter if you know them,
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:39.200]   just get enough people creating videos that our algorithm can go to work. And so TikTok can make
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.480]   a move at Facebook and Twitter because their castle walls are built around their social graph.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.560]   And everyone who was trying to attack their castle with a similar strategy, couldn't get over those
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:54.320]   walls. TikTok was the woman with the dragons and they flew over. They didn't use the social graph.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:14:01.920]   Okay. So what's going to happen? Well, here's the key. I think the key thing going on in social
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:08.000]   media, digital news is that TikTok success. These developments put traditional social media
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.440]   companies like Facebook in a perilous bind. They're losing users right now to TikTok because
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.960]   TikTok again is in the same cognitive space as far as a user is concerned. User created content,
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.720]   I want distraction on my phone and they're doing a better job of it. So people are going over to
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:31.840]   TikTok and what happened? Meta found that their new user growth slowed and they lost over $200
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:37.600]   billion in market capitalization in a single day when they released that report. So this is public
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.760]   companies. There's huge investor pressure. We can't lose, we can't have our revenue go down.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.520]   We can't lose this many users to TikTok, which got to a billion users in just a couple of years.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.320]   It's just really exploding. So they have to do something. So what are they doing? They're trying
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.000]   to be more like TikTok, which may be in the short term makes sense. They're like, okay,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.520]   if this is what people like, we need to do the same thing. But this is where I think
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.840]   they accidentally destabilize their entire foundation of all of their protection.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.240]   So here's what I wrote. If companies like Facebook, so they instead move away from
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:13.440]   their social graph foundations to concentrate on optimizing in the moment engagement,
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.320]   they'll enter a competitive landscape that pits them directly against the many other
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.760]   existing sources of mobile distraction, not just TikTok, but also more bespoke and specialized
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.800]   social networks, streaming services, et cetera, et cetera. So as soon as you are offering
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.720]   entertainment, that's not based on the social graph, you are competing with every other source
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.360]   of entertainment and distraction on the phone. I don't think that's a battle that Facebook or
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:42.800]   Instagram or Twitter can win long term. Once they leave the protection of their social graph,
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.600]   they will be chipped away from by this other competition until eventually
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:55.440]   their role of dominance is going to wane. And that's my conclusion. This all points to a
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.560]   possible future in which social media giants like Facebook may soon be past their long stretch of
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:05.120]   dominance. They'll continue to chase new engagement models, leaving behind the protection of their
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.600]   social graphs and in doing so, eventually succumb to the new competitive pressures this introduces.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:18.080]   Now, last time I talked about this idea on this show, some of my listeners, some of you came
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.640]   wrote back to me and said, "Oh, so you're saying like TikTok is better or like it's somehow we're
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.880]   in a better world if TikTok just dominates everything? Isn't that just as bad?" So here's
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:33.200]   the key nuance, which by the way, based on your feedback as listeners, I knew to really hit this
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:39.600]   point in my New Yorker piece. TikTok of course is subject to the same pressures. So in this future,
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.080]   it too will eventually fade. So no, I do not think TikTok is going to be some 20 year long
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.240]   cultural force. I don't think TikTok is going to be a four year from now, be a cultural force.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:55.040]   It's entirely shallow in the sense that it has no network effect foundation. It's just purified
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.800]   distraction. It's incredibly shallow foundation. The Zeitgeist can change on TikTok like that in a
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.560]   way that it couldn't on Facebook and it couldn't on Twitter because all your friends were already
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.320]   on Facebook and all the interesting people were on Twitter and all of these connections and those
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.480]   social graphs were there. And even if you soured on Facebook because you didn't like their role
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.320]   in the presidential election, or even if you soured on Twitter because you don't like Elon Musk,
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.080]   there really was no other game in town that could offer you that. TikTok has none of those
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:27.840]   advantages. It's just me look pretty screen, me like, me swipe. Other things can serve that
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:32.640]   purpose. So if the Zeitgeist changes against TikTok, it could just fall out of people's favor
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.840]   almost immediately. So no, I don't think TikTok is going to last as some replacement force of
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:44.320]   dominance. I think it's going to, it's coming in hot Twitter, maybe, but definitely Facebook,
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.440]   definitely Instagram chases it, destabilizes their competitive advantage, leads to their downfall.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:55.760]   The only reason why I say maybe with Twitter is it has investor pressure, but as we saw with the
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:01.840]   Elon Musk bid, they're small enough. They could be taken private. So if Musk had taken them private
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.000]   and you got rid of that investor pressure, he could have just said, and someone else could still do
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.080]   this. Let's just lean into what we do well. I don't care if we lose users in the short term,
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.880]   no one else can do what we do at this distributed curation of interesting things said by interesting
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.800]   people. So let's just keep doing that. We're not going to disappear. Let's just fire a bunch of
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:24.480]   people, focus, become profitable. Maybe that's a way to stick around. Facebook, Instagram,
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:30.480]   way too big. When you're a $600 billion company, you can't go private. You can't let users fall.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.160]   So I think they're, they're essentially doomed. So that's the future I see. And that's how I
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:40.560]   summarize this article. I think the social media giants, their dominance is going to wane. I think
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.600]   TikTok is going to come and go. Its main point will be at help to stabilize those. And all of
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.640]   this could be good because it opens up the territory. You get rid of the warlords who
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.320]   were keeping everyone else down. It opens up the territory for more innovation, more interesting
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.520]   services, bespoke services, more fragmented services, more distributed or nonprofit services,
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.480]   crazy services that are homespun and eccentric. And only so many people use them, but they love
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:09.680]   them. There's more room for all of this when you get rid of these giant a hundred billion dollar
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.000]   BMS that had these pseudo monopolies. And so that is the conclusion, how I conclude the article.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.360]   In the end, TikTok's biggest legacy might be less about its current moment of world conquering
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:27.360]   success, which will pass and more about how by forcing social media giants like Facebook to
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:34.160]   chase its model, it will end up liberating the social internet. So that is the polished form
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:40.240]   of my thoughts about TikTok and its impact on the internet. I think I've now talked about this
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:46.960]   enough so we can retire the topic for more, read the article at the New Yorker. You can just find
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.880]   my contributor page. You'll find it. It's called TikTok in the fall of the social media giants.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.640]   If you don't subscribe to the New Yorker, well, you should, but if you don't, I also wrote about
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:02.160]   the article and added some extra points in my newsletter. So go to calnewport.com/blog and you
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.600]   can see the article I wrote about this. And while there, you should sign up for that newsletter so
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:12.160]   you can get sent straight to your inbox, this type of thinking. So there we go.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:19.360]   Good summary. The podcast, man, podcast made without the podcast, this idea might not have
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.320]   existed. It was riffing on the news stuff that listeners sent me that I would not have seen.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:31.360]   I would not have seen that article about Blake Chan, Lee and CNBC, et cetera. If a listener had
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.720]   to send it to us and then since I wouldn't have seen it and then we were riffing on it, you and
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:39.680]   I on the show and that sort of set the wheels in motion. So that's cool. Yeah. It's podcast.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:44.400]   There was some vocabulary in there that I didn't even know. So I learned something for sure.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:51.200]   Welcome to the New Yorker world. Yeah, you got out with the source. You got out with the source
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.440]   handy. By the way, speaking of New Yorker and then we'll move on. But I read the, you told me
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.520]   about the article from last week, Tad Friend's article about the door-to-door salesman.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.800]   Oh yeah. I haven't finished that yet.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.920]   It's really good. Yeah. Yeah. So Jesse told me, I always, if people, people ask me, how do I read,
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.960]   what's my New Yorker reading habits with the magazine? Um, because it's hard, it's long and
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.040]   it comes every week. So here it is. So here's my New Yorker reading habits. So you can, you can
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:20.960]   follow suit if you subscribe. So you get the daily email and that points out like what's going on,
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.400]   what was posted on the web that day. What's interesting. So I would say 50% of the daily
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:31.040]   emails will point out an article that I ended up reading on the web because they published like a
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:35.520]   new article every day on the web. Uh, for the magazine, my rule is like, you always have to
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:40.000]   read one and if there's more, sometimes you'll read more than one, but you always have to read
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.080]   one. And so that forces you, even if it's a day where the five articles, none of them are right
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.600]   in your sweet spot. You read about door-to-door salesman or something else. It's really interesting.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.640]   And so that's my role. Read the daily email to see what catches your attention. That's where a lot
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.640]   of my stuff is featured. So definitely read that. And then you got to read one, one per week,
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.520]   at least. I have a similar rule too.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.880]   Yeah. I just look at the table of contents and then circle two. And then
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.280]   if there's two I like, then I read them. And then otherwise,
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.320]   and then it breaks the seal and then you end up reading more a lot of times, but like, you always
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:13.280]   have to read at least one. Oh, and then the third rule is you have to leave the magazine out kind
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:17.840]   of prominently in your house or apartment and like, Oh, when people come over, Oh, sorry, let me just
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.400]   clean this up over here. I just was, you got to put it next to your copy of the Harper's
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.400]   and the Paris.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.880]   Do you recycle them a lot quickly thereafter?
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:34.640]   Yeah. It was just when the pile grows, I suppose.
