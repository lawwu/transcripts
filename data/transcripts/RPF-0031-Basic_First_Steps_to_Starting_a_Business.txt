[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   for today, Wednesday, July 30, 2014.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   I'm your host, Joshua Sheets, and today we're gonna be
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   talking about business, specifically starting one.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   (laughs)
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   One of my favorite topics, in case you can't tell
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   from previous episodes, and I'm just gonna give
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   a few tips and ideas for practically
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   how do you start a business.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Unfortunately, it's a subject they don't teach in school,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   so we're gonna start teaching it here today.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   This podcast is actually the result of a podcast
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   and the result of some recent conversations
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   with a friend of mine who's just starting a business
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   of his own, and when we were talking,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I was trying to give him some ideas and some tips,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   and we started talking about a few of the details
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   surrounding business startup, and I realized that,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I don't know why I haven't realized this in the past,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   but I realized that we don't talk a lot about business
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   and about starting businesses, how to start businesses.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And it's interesting, I was reflecting back on the book
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   that Jake DeSilis wrote on entrepreneurship
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   and was just reflecting on why that is,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   and the reality is that most of our teachers in life,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   in formalized schooling, most of our teachers are employees.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   They're employees of the school board,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   or of a private institution.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And so I thought, wow, it's no shock that we don't know
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   how to start a business, but I was just reflecting on
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and speaking with my friend, I was just reflecting
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   on how valuable just some basic knowledge
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   about how to start a business would be and can be.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And there are lots of books, lots of excellent books
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   that are written about this that I think are well worth reading,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   and I'll try to, maybe at the end of the show,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   if I can remember a few of the ones that I've really enjoyed
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   over the years, I'll try to make some recommendations.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I don't have them written down, but maybe I'll do it
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   off the top of my head.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   But it's fairly simple.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   The whole process of business is fairly simple,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   but in other ways, it's pretty daunting.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And I recognized back, I was just thinking back
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   to when I started my business,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   my financial planning business about six years ago,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   and I was an entrepreneur for the first time,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   dealing with business taxes and entity selection
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   and all of that for the first time,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   and I realized, you know, it is a pretty daunting,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   overwhelming, overwhelming thing,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   but it really doesn't have to be.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   So today's show is going to be a list of some tips
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and some things that I think are interesting and useful.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And if no one listens, it's specifically for my friend
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   that I want to give this information to,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   and I hope you can benefit by listening
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   in on the conversation as well.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   It's a little easier for me to sit down
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   and compose some ideas like this
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   than it is to talk his ear off,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   to talk his ear off in person.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And I hope this will be a little easier to listen to.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   There are kind of two aspects to starting a business,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   and so the thing that was worrying a friend of mine
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   was kind of what I would classify as entity selection.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And, you know, should I open-- should I start an LLC?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Should I open a corporation?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And I'm going to deal with, like, which entity
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   in a separate topic, in a separate show.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   But today's show is basically just going to be--
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   my answer is don't bother with that right now.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Just don't even worry about it.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   So Joshua's steps to starting a business.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And I think that this is so key
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   because the reality is I think we should all be--
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I think this should be useful to all of us.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   First of all, I think that we're all already in business,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and we should learn to think like business people.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   So to me, a stage of-- a very important step of freedom--
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   and I don't know how to list these out in an orderly way
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   that this is the step, but I think a very important step
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   along the way is for all of us
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   to view ourselves as self-employed.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And whether we work for an employer
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   or whether we work for a business that we own,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   all of us to view ourselves as self-employed
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   because if we view ourselves as self-employed,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   we'll start to run more calculations.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And I've gone over that in previous episodes,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   but those calculations are important.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   You know, am I getting the value for my effort
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   that I need to be getting?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Is there some way that I can enhance my value
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   so that my customer, which happens to be my employer,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   is willing to pay me more money?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So the business owner is constantly thinking about it,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   saying, "How can I deliver a higher amount of value
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   "so that my customer will choose to repay me
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   for that value with their cash?"
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   That's the essence of business in and of itself.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And I think this would be really helpful for us as a culture
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   if we really institutionalized this way of thinking.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   But--and I don't see any way that it's gonna happen
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   in our current paradigm, and that's okay.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   So Joshua, step number one for starting a business.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   If you have a business idea, number one,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   sit down with a pen and a piece of paper,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   turn your cell phone off, turn your computer off,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   get away from everything for just 10 minutes,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   10 minutes at most,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   and write out what you propose to do and for whom.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   So what is your business?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   What do you propose to do and for whom?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   So do you propose to make stuff?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Do you propose to make something?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And then who's gonna buy it?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   And then--or do you propose to do something,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   provide some kind of service,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   and who's gonna pay for that service?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And it seems silly, and I mean, it seems simple.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   You're like, "Well, I wouldn't be starting this idea
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   "if I didn't know it."
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   But many times we don't take the time to write stuff down.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And if you just write a paragraph,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   "This is what I want to do and for whom,"
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   then that will help a lot.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And it's much more valuable to be specific,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   as specific as possible with it.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And then number two, most important, next step,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   is write out a plan for how you propose
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   to reach those people.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   If you go through formal business school
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   and you learn about, you know, business plans
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   and all of that--and by the way,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   one comment on business plans.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   There is dramatic evidence to show--
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I've read various surveys,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   none of which I can cite for you today,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   so you just take my generalized word for it.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I've read various studies that have shown
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   that the having of a business plan,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   the existence of a business plan,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   is a significant marker in the potential success
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   of a company.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   But if you actually interview the entrepreneur
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   who's starting a business,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   it's very often--very often
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   that the entrepreneur never refers to the business plan.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And the idea is that the business plan
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   is a way of sitting down and thinking on paper.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And this is my opinion.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Thinking on paper, thinking in advance
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   of what all of the things that are going to happen
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   and can happen and all the things that could go wrong
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   and what you would do and all the things that could go right
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   and what you would do then,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   just gives you a valuable mental exercise
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   where without yet being out in the thick of things,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   you can sit down and you can just start thinking it through.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   "What would I do in that situation?"
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   So thinking on paper--and this is the essence.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   These two things are very simple parts
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   of a business plan.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   You don't need to pull up a business plan template online
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   and bother through that nonsense.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   You just need to answer a few basic questions.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   "What do I propose to do and for whom?"
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And then, "How do I propose to reach those people?"
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   "What's my marketing plan for reaching those people?"
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I think many business owners could easily--
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   many people who are starting businesses
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   can very easily start and answer the question--
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   can answer question number one.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Many fewer can answer question number two--
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   "How do I propose to reach those people?"
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   But it's incredibly important.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Businesses don't succeed or fail--
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   businesses don't succeed or fail based upon--
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   businesses generally succeed or fail
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   based upon not reaching enough people,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   not selling enough stuff.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And oftentimes, if you have a reasonably good--
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   or at least average--product or service,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   it's the marketing plan that's the key thing.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   And so you want to sit down and say,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   "What is my marketing plan?"
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   "Am I going to reach people individually
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   "by calling them out of the phone book
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   "or out of the Chamber of Commerce directory?"
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   "Am I going to reach people with a web page
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   "that they find through targeted traffic?"
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   "Am I going to reach people
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   "through word-of-mouth referrals?"
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   "Well, in that case, how am I going to let people
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   "that know me and know what I do
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   "know about my word-of-mouth referrals?"
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   "How am I going to start reaching people?"
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   If you have the answers to those questions,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   you basically have--you basically have your business.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And then the next step is, "Don't wait.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   "Just start. Start reaching out to people
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   and start selling."
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   There was a--there's a saying, and--called--
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   the saying is, "Ready, fire, aim."
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   We're all familiar with the idea of "Ready, aim, fire."
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   And an author named Michael Masterson
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   wrote a book on it called "Ready, Fire, Aim."
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   He used that as his title.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Excellent book.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   And the point that I agree with
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   and that I've seen in many things
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   is don't worry about how to be good at it.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Just go--go--go start trying it.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   It's--it's so much easier to adjust
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   once you've seen what the business is actually like,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   once you've actually gone out and started doing it,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   than it is to sit back in a closed room
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   and try to imagine all of the possibilities
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   that are--that are there.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   So just go out and start reaching out to people.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Start selling. Start selling. Start selling.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   And let the market give you the feedback
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   that you need to adjust your product offerings.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   If you're finding that it's very difficult
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   to sell what you thought you were gonna sell
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   and you're not having any success selling that,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   then ask your customers or your--
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   your target customers, "Okay, the offering,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   "the product, or the service that I'm trying to offer you
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   "is not--is clearly not attractive to you.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   "Would you be willing to tell me what is attractive to you?"
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And then think--can see--
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   figure out if you can offer that.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   So the key with business is to ignore everything about it
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   until you go and start selling.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Don't print business cards. Don't get office space.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Don't buy stuff. Don't buy products, even.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Don't, you know, set up accounting systems.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Don't do any of this stuff. Go sell.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   And if you just go sell and you have money coming in,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   then you have the cash flow to sustain
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   all of those other aspects.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   So I remember a--
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   there was one useful anecdote in 4-Hour Workweek
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   with Tim Ferris-- that Tim Ferris wrote.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And I remember he put this into the 4-Hour Workweek
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   as part of his suggestions for building an online business.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   He said, "Make a product and go put an ad up.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   "And create a landing page saying,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   "'Sorry, this product is not--'"
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   I think he used, like, Hawaiian shirts or something.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   "So create what you think is a super great tropical linen
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   "Hawaiian loose weave shirt.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   "Write an ad for it.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   "Go out and buy some Google ads
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   "and put that ad in front of customers
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   "and measure the results.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   "Have product A and product B,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   "and neither of them have been created yet.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   "But go out and get some people to click on that
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   "and then measure--maybe put a form there
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   "where they can opt in to be notified
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   "when the product is ready, and then measure the results.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   "And then that will help you to identify
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   "what product offering there is."
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Until you've sold something,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   you have no ability to have a business, period.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   And so the key is go out and sell, sell, sell, sell, sell.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Sell your product, sell your service,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   sell your product, sell your service,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   and then adjust and get feedback from your customers.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Ask them, "What do you really like about this?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   "What's going well about it?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   "What would you like to improve?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   "If I could offer you a better service,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   "what would you improve about that?"
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   This is the most important thing,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   is to get really comfortable going out and selling.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Unfortunately, this is also the hardest thing.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   So what many entrepreneurs will want to do
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   is they'll want to go out and rent office space
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   and get furniture and set up a website and all this.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Selling is uncomfortable.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   But you have to go out and sell.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   If you can't go out and sell
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   and you can't get cash coming in the door,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   you have no business.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   You have a dream, you have an idea,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   so I say get out there and sell.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Now, as far as what do you formally need to do
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   to start a business, nothing.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Absolutely nothing.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   You don't need to do anything.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   You could start and run seven businesses in one year,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   zero the next, 15 the next, zero the next.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   So from the--
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Generally, people are concerned about taxes and legality
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   and all of that.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Unless there's some kind of business license
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   that you need from a local municipality
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   or there's some kind of occupational license,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   and that stuff does exist, and you should know about it
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   if you're going to go and find your industry.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   But from a tax perspective or from the IRS perspective,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   you don't have to do anything to set up a business.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Just go do it.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   If you make money at it, you need to record the money,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   and then you'll offset the expenses,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   which is what we'll get to in just a second.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   But you don't need to start a corporation,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   you don't need to start an LLC.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Just get out there and start selling.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And if you get out there and start selling
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   and you're a successful business,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   now go ahead and get the formalities in place.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And the formalities can be put in place very, very quickly.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   So it's really not that big of a deal.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   If you make money and you don't have anything in place--
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   let's say you haven't started a corporation,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   you haven't filed for an LLC, any of that stuff--
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   and you made money, all you'll do is you'll simply total up
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   at the end of the year how much money you made,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   you'll subtract any expenses that were associated
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   with that money, and then you'll file
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   what's called a Schedule C on your taxes.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   And a Schedule C is a separate schedule
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   that you file with your Form 1040
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   for your annual income tax return,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   and it's for profit or loss from a business.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   And if you made money on the business,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   then you'll go ahead and pay income taxes
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   and employment and self-employment taxes on the money.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   And if you lost money, you can deduct that loss
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   against your other income.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   So it's no big deal.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   And you don't have to keep the business going.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   You can have one business that you did in January,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   one business that you did April through November,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   and a third business that you did for 2 months
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   in July and August.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   It's really not a big deal.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   You would just file under that scenario.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   You would file 3 separate Schedule Cs.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Now, you do, of course, want to keep this practically in hand.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   So step 4 is very simple.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Open a business checking account.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   And this may or may not be a business checking account.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   In fact, I think you're probably better off
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   just starting with a personal checking account
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   and ignoring the name of your business.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Don't worry about going out and getting a business checking account
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   in the name of Acme Corporation.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Rather, just simply say, "Hey, I'm Joshua Sheets,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   and I'm opening a checking account."
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And people are just going to write their checks to Joshua Sheets.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   But set up a separate business checking account
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   for every business that you're running.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   And this is the simplest way to keep records.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Just simply establish a separate account.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Again, you can use a free personal checking account.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   A lot of banks want to charge for business checking accounts.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   So some banks will offer lots of free personal checking accounts,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   but then will charge you for the business checking accounts.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Technically, a business checking account is going to--
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   basically, the only difference between a business checking account
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   and a personal checking account in general for a small business
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   is going to be the fact that your business name
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   will be listed on your checks,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   and the fact that you can accept checks
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   written out to your business name.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   So that can be useful
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   if someone's going to write out a check payment to XYZ Corporation.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   That can be useful.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   But it's probably not necessary in the beginning.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   So it may just be simpler to start a separate personal checking account.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   And then if you need to spend any money for the business,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   make sure that you spend it out of that business checking account.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Pull out your phone, do it at the same bank you bank with
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   with your personal banking.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   And if you're going to spend business,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   you need to go and buy some materials for your company or whatever.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Just pull out your phone,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   transfer $100 from your personal checking account
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   into your business checking account,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   and then swipe your debit card for $100 at the materials store.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   And that way you'll have a bank statement
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   that will generally have all of your expenses
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   that are associated with the business.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   And so this can be from the little to the big.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   You really want to make sure that you have everything listed on there.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   So whether this is, "I bought some pens at Office Depot."
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Are they still in business? I think so.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   "I bought some pens at Office Depot or Office Max or Staples
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   or whoever the latest business people are."
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Or if it is, "I've had lunch with somebody as a prospective client lunch."
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   If there's anything that you're doing associated with the business,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   and basically that's all you need to know.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   If this expense that I'm about to incur,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   this expenditure is associated with my business,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   swipe your business checking, your business debit card.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   It's a good idea to probably set up a separate business credit card as well.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   So you might set up just another credit card account.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   This can be a personal credit card,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   just like it can be a personal checking account.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   One reason to do that is just to protect yourself from,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   potentially in the future, bankruptcy laws, things like that.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   For example, in the state of Florida where I live,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   you just want to make sure things are separated.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   And then also if you are going to go into debt to start your business,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   which may or may not be a good idea, probably isn't,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   but better to out-earn it, but if you need to,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   if you want to go into debt to start a business,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   then you want to make sure that any debt that you have is deductible debt.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   So if you were going to make the choice between spending money on the--
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   let's say you have $100 in your checking account,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   and you need to spend $100 on business and $100 on personal stuff.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Better for you to go--so you're going to be $100 short.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Better for you to go $100 in debt on the business credit card,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   which can just be a separate personal credit card
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   that only has business expenses on it.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   The IRS would want to see if you're going to deduct this and you're audited,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   the IRS would like to see that you only have business expenses,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   that you're not commingling your business and your personal expenses.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   This is a big deal.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   But it would be better to go ahead and charge the $100 on the business credit card
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   and pay for the $100 of groceries that you need out of your personal checking account.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   That way, if you're going to go into credit card debt,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   you don't wind up with non-deductible debt.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   You want to make sure that you can deduct those interest payments as a business expense.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   So just a little tip.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   So simple business checking account, simple business credit card,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   both of which can actually be a personal checking account and a personal credit card,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   but just a personal checking account that you only use for business
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   and a personal credit card that you only use for business expenses.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   This is--you don't need to get any more complicated than that.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   And that could work literally for years.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   You don't need to worry with all the entity selection in general for most parts.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   All the books that you read notwithstanding,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   most businesses have pretty low liability,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   and most people don't have a lot of assets that they need the liability protection from.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Now, we'll talk about--it's fairly easy and simple to set up a corporate form of some type,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   and I'll talk through that in a separate show as far as entity selection,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   LLC versus S corporation versus C corporation versus sole proprietorship,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   LLP if you're in that kind of business, and partnerships and all those options.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   But for today, just ignore it.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Go and get your business making money,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   and if you go and get your business making money, you can deal with all the rest of that stuff.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   If your business isn't making money, no matter how perfect your corporate formation is,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   it doesn't matter.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   It's completely irrelevant.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Keep that business checking account balanced.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Keep that business check register.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Because what this will turn into is this will basically turn into a very simple profit and loss statement.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   So let's say that you look in that business checking account register,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   and you see that you have money piling up in there.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Well, that's good.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   That means you're making a profit.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   And so then once a week or once every two weeks or once a month,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   go ahead and if you need money for your personal expenses,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   go ahead and transfer the money out of that business checking account into your personal expenses.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   But you want to make sure you keep that account current.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Put all of the money that you're earning from the business into that checking account,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   and then just write a check over to the personal checking account
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   or just pull out your phone and transfer it right from your phone.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   That's fine.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   But the key is you can see how profitable your business is.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   And this is a very rudimentary but still useful form of a profit and loss statement.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   People oftentimes get bogged down with the accounting stuff.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Don't get bogged down.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   This is a very simple, very useful profit and loss statement.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   If you write a check once a month from your business account to your personal account,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   you can sit down and you can look in there and say, "Oh, look, there's $5,000 in there.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   There's $50,000 in there," depending on your scale.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Great. That means we're making money.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Now, some of that money you'll need to reinvest back into the business.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   So if you have $5,000 and you're going to pull $3,000 out,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   well, you know I'm reinvesting $2,000 back into the business.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   But you'll start to get an idea of am I making money or not.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   And as silly as it sounds, that's actually a big deal,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   and many business owners don't know if they're making money or not.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   By keeping everything associated with that separate account, you can be confident,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   whether it's checking account or credit card,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   pay that business credit card out of the business checking account,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   you can be confident that you know, "Okay, I'm operating in the black.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   I'm making money." It's a big deal.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Second suggestion that is associated is set up some kind of business journal.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   So just a 10-cent notebook is fine.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   But open up some kind of notebook and write down what you're doing for the business on a daily basis.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   So each day when you're working in the business, write down what you're doing.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   So if you're working in a service business and you have a job in the morning and a job in the afternoon,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   just write down, "Okay, job for client A in the morning, four hours, I may earned $300.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Job for client B in the afternoon, this, you know, three hours, however much you earned."
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Write down where they were.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Write down what part of town those jobs happen to be in.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   This is important for a couple of reasons.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Number one, it is important from a tax perspective to have records.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   So you want to make sure that you get all your deductions,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   and you're not going to be able to know to get all your deductions
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   unless you have some sort of written record.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   So you need to have a mileage log.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   So any miles that you drive for business, you need to make a note of those miles,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   and that can go right into this simple notebook.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Every day, the simplest way, although technically it probably wouldn't pass muster with the IRS,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   but it probably would, I think it would, but you wouldn't know until you tested it.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Simplest way is when you get in the car, from your place of business,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   wherever your place of business starts, make a note, and you zero out the trip meter.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Drive your days done, and when you're done, at the end of the day at your place of business,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   write down what that trip meter said in the notebook.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Technically, in my knowledge, according to the IRS regulations,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   you should have beginning odometer reading and an ending odometer reading,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   and then the difference between them, and then you need to have a listing of the trips.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   But you can basically have that if you're taking a business--
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   if you're just keeping a business journal of your activities.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And write down all of your activities. Track all of your activities.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   You don't know what activities are going to be the good ones that are going to be very productive,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   and you don't know how to coach yourself unless you have data.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   So if a business coach comes in--let's say that you're in sales,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   and you are in sales because you're running a business.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   If you're in sales, the first thing you're going to say is--
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   let's say that I'm coaching you, and you're in sales.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   You say, "I'm not doing very well, Josh." Okay.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   First thing you say is, "Well, what are you doing? What is your activity?
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   How many calls are you making? How many appointments are you getting from those calls?
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Of those appointments, how many appointments are resulting in business?"
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Very rudimentary tracking.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   And so all salespeople know--all good salespeople know--all highly paid salespeople know--
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   you need to have a net record of that.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Today I made 63 phone calls that were potential for business.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Of those 63 phone calls, I reached 24 people.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   I reached 24 people. I scheduled 9 appointments, and so I've got 9 appointments.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   You go on those appointments, you know I've got--I had 9 appointments scheduled,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   and out of those 9 appointments, I was able to write--I was able to secure 3 contracts
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   or 3 sales for my business, whatever it is.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   So you need to have a record of that.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Even if you're operating a retail store, you want to have a record of the traffic into your store--
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   how many people are coming into your store.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   If you don't have any metrics, then you can't figure out how to improve things.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   So if you were running a retail store,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   and you didn't know how many people were coming into your store,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   you wouldn't really know any scientific way.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   If you invest in a new sign out front, or you invest in paying a sign spinner to stand on the road,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   you wouldn't have any way of knowing if that's increasing your business or not.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   You may have a gut feeling, and that gut feeling may be accurate,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   but it's much better to have the data.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   And so set up some kind of tracking mechanism.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   In the beginning, all you need is a notebook,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   and just write down what you're doing and what you did,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   and write down any detail you can think of that might be helpful.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Now, with these details, you can then later on, you'll be able to coach yourself.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   You'll be able to coach yourself.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And so one of the major things that people forget about with anything--
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   with financial planning, with starting businesses--
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   is that you can coach yourself, but you need to be able to be a little bit disattached.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   And so it helps to be a little bit emotionally detached from the situation,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   and data and records and tracking will help you to have that information.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   So just keep a business notebook,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   and write in there your financial transactions,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   even though you're going to keep the checkbook, write in there what you're spending your money on,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   what the income was from,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   because then at the end of the month, you can go through there,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   and you're going to spend some time working on your business.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   If you read any business literature, you'll find--
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   I think Michael Gerber, with his book "The E-Myth,"
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   was one of the first ones who--
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   or he was one of the ones who really popularized this concept in modern culture.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   But you can either work in your business, or you can work on your business.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   And both are probably going to be important.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   But most people spend a lot of time working in their business
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   and very little time working on their business.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   But those who work on their business are going to experience a dramatic improvement--
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   dramatically better results than those who are just simply working in their business.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   So if you sit down, and you're able to sit down and say,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   "I'm going to go back through this last month of my journal,"
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   and just read through it, and you'll start to notice, "Hey, look at this.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   This job here I was at, I did this job for one hour."
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   And by the way, for you, the audience,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   I'm specifically thinking of my friend as I record this show,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   and he's starting a service business.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   That's why I have a lot of service business anecdotes here.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   But you're looking at it saying, "This job, I did this job, I was there for one hour.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   It was close to home, and it was an extremely profitable job.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   It cost a lot of money.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   What were the characteristics of that job? How did I find it?"
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   And then think about it.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   And then look for any trends, and look for any information.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   You need to have the data so that you can read through it,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   so that you can kind of mine it.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Now, you will probably, over time, get fancier.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   You'll get fancier and start tracking things with graphs and charts and things like that.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Or you may not.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   But if you just keep a simple business ledger--
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   and this can be something that is very useful to you.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Every phone call received, you write down the name and their phone number.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   That's a really useful info of any leads, things like that.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   That's really, really useful.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   So with these two things, you have a business checking account.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   You've got your financial stuff taken care of.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   You know the income that's coming into your business.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   You know the expenses that are going out of your business.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   You know if you're making money or not.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   And you have something that you can sit down with your accountant at the end of the year and give to them.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.100]   And with a business journal, you have a journal of all of your activities
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.200]   and write down in there everything that you're doing.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:38.900]   It's simple, it's low tech, it's low key, it's cheap, both of these things are free.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:44.700]   But you have... they're both very important and very valuable if you implement them.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.200]   And then, here's the key.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.200]   Go make money.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.400]   Go sell. Sell, sell, sell.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.900]   Do work, do jobs.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.400]   Sell, sell, sell. Do work, do jobs.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.600]   Sell, sell, sell. Do work, do jobs.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.300]   And do that until you start to make some money.
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.800]   And that could be a couple weeks, it could be a month or two, a couple months,
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.600]   that could be, I don't know, it could be a year or two if you're doing this as a sideline gig
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.400]   on top of your standard employment.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.100]   Just go and sell and go and make money.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.100]   And then adjust.
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:21.000]   And listen to the feedback that you get and ask people for feedback and listen to the feedback.
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:28.800]   None of this, clearly, is like rocket science business stuff as far as entity stuff.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   But I've just seen so many people get paralyzed by all of the financial planning topics
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:39.400]   when reality is you got to get out there and do business.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.900]   So, that's it.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.300]   I mean, really, that's all I've got.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.500]   And with those two things, I mean, it sounds so simple,
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.000]   but with the business checking account and with the business journal,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.200]   you'll be able to have the tools that you need to coach yourself
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:00.000]   or to be able to have somebody else coach you and help you.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.400]   And you have all the information that you need
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:07.000]   so that your accountant, your financial advisor, your attorney,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   your business partners, your employees, your mentors,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.700]   so that these people will have the data that they need to be able to help you.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.100]   And the key is to have those data.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.800]   So then if you were sitting down in my office and we were talking about,
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.900]   you know, should I set up an LLC, then I would just say,
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:25.000]   "Well, tell me about your business," or, "Should I establish an S-corporation?
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.200]   Tell me about your business."
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.800]   And then we would talk about the financials
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.200]   and we would go through the personal records.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.000]   So, this information is the starting block.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   So, start tracking this information and go from there.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.900]   I will do a separate show, a completely separate show on entity selection,
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.900]   and that will be the next one you want to listen to.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:50.500]   So, do I want to file for some kind of corporate or partnership form of entity selection,
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.900]   or do I just want to stay as a sole proprietorship?
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:58.900]   Well, my message, the drum that I want to beat today, is don't worry about it.
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.100]   Go make money.
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:03.900]   And then once you've made money, then come back and fix all that stuff.
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.300]   Now, there are exceptions to this rule.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.500]   If you are an established business person
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:13.500]   and you have a very high, you know, investment into--
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.300]   you're setting--you're planning to, I don't know, open a restaurant,
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.900]   you're going to do $100,000 of renovations,
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.800]   this is not necessarily how you would do it.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.800]   But for just the vast majority of businesses that are starting,
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.600]   it really is this simple.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.500]   There's not much more to it.
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.500]   My opinion also, it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission,
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:32.800]   so just go do it.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.700]   And if you need some kind of business license or something like that,
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.200]   then deal with that when you find out about it.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.800]   That's our show for today.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.200]   I know it was a little bit different than the normal Wednesday topics.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.600]   I really struggled.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.300]   I hope this was interesting.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:49.500]   I had about four or five different show topics I wanted to deal with today.
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.700]   And I actually started recording this show twice on--
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.000]   three times, actually, on a completely different topic,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.300]   and it's just falling flat.
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:00.000]   So I said, "I'm going to go with what I'm inspired to do," and that was this.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.100]   So I hope that this is helpful to you.
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.300]   I hope this is beneficial.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.500]   Thank you for listening, and I would encourage you, go start some businesses.
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.800]   The cool thing about doing it the way I'm doing it, there's no risk.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.100]   Go start some businesses, and you'll find out,
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.900]   "Hey, I like that one, I don't like that one.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.800]   Oh, this one looks like this one's good."
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.500]   And then once you've done it a few times, it's really not that big a deal.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.800]   There's so many business opportunities that are out there that are easy to do.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.400]   So I'd encourage you, pick one and go for it.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.900]   Have a great Wednesday, everybody.
