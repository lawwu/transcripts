[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.860]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. We always appreciate your comments, questions, feedback.
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.760]   Email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com. Duncan, yesterday you and I were talking offline.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.000]   We both have some farming in our lineage. I think you said you have a beard, so that's
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.960]   close enough. But my great uncle owned a farm. He passed that down to my Uncle Patrick, who's
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.580]   actually the namesake of my middle name. That's my middle name, Patrick. He still owns and
[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.920]   runs this farm. He used to have a bunch of animals, cows, pigs, chickens, that sort of
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.920]   stuff. Now it's all fruits and vegetables. One thing I learned, he has 58 different varieties
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.360]   of apple trees on his farm, which I didn't even realize that there was that many.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.360]   Did not know that.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.120]   I actually worked on the farm a little bit growing up. Tried to earn my keep. One of
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.200]   the oldest professions on the planet. Our sponsor today, AcreTrader, allows you to invest
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.160]   in farmland across the country. Michael and I like to call them the Zillow of farmland,
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.600]   because they're trying to take all these different factors and figure out water and soil and
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.520]   allow it to be better analyzed. They say one of the benefits of investing in farmland is
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.820]   that it has little correlation with stocks and bonds, but it has very positive correlation
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.040]   to inflation. So, it's something of an inflation hedge. If you think about it, this makes sense.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.640]   There's direct correlation between farmland, commodities, food prices, all that stuff.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.600]   When prices are going up, it would make sense that farmland would do well. AcreTrader makes
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.440]   it simple to invest in professionally-reviewed farmland and timberland. Visit AcreTrader.com
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.680]   to learn more and to understand the risks involved in investing in farmland. Please
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.480]   go to AcreTrader.com/company/terms. Duncan, welcome back. You were out last week.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.120]   Can I just say a quick thing about the sponsorship thing?
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.240]   Let's do it.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.920]   You don't have to go do anything. Just sending traffic to these sites, it makes us look good.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.400]   That's all you have to do. Click the link. You don't even have to do anything. Just want
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.840]   to throw it out there.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.920]   Okay. Nice plug. You don't have to do anything. Just click on it. We missed you last week,
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.180]   Duncan. You were under the weather. Last week's show, we talked about a reader of my blog
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.160]   that I'd become friends with who recently passed away. He had this strategy for asset
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.120]   allocation and portfolio withdrawals, and he called it the four-year rule. We had dozens
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.100]   and dozens of people email in and say, "Hey, I'd like to get more information on this four-year
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.360]   plan." If anyone wants it, they can feel free to email us. I'd send it to a bunch of people.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.280]   But I think this is just a good reminder, especially during a bear market, that everyone
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.200]   needs a plan. And I think even a bad plan or a suboptimal plan is better than no plan
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.640]   at all, because this is the time you realize how important it is to understand what it
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.640]   is you're doing.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.560]   We get all these questions all the time, like, "Should I buy this? Should I sell this? Should
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.080]   I get rid of these losses?" And I think the biggest problem for most people is that they
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.440]   go into a lot of their investments without having a plan in place. Obviously, there's
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.840]   going to always be unforeseen circumstances in your life, in the markets, whatever, in
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.640]   the economy. But just having a plan, I think, can just make this a little bit easier to
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.480]   deal with in the stomach, even when we have these bad times.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.920]   Yeah. I think that was a really good post. I was looking at it, and I saw that the person
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.760]   -- I can't think of her name right now, but they had actually responded really, really
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.760]   substantially in a comment on your site back when you posted it. That was back when people
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.440]   actually interacted in the comments and stuff?
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.800]   Yeah. I don't have comments anymore. I turned them off. It was too much. But, yeah. Feel
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.000]   free to leave one in the YouTube. So, all right. Let's get to our first question.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.920]   Okay. Actually, I'm going to have you stall for one second, because I just noticed an
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.920]   issue.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.960]   See, Duncan needs a plan for the show, because John, our behind-the-scenes producer, is not
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.920]   here today. So, Duncan's flying solo. And we've had some technical difficulties today,
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.800]   but we're going to get through it. And if we can't show the first question, we'll just
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   read it.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.280]   Yeah. Believe it or not, it's actually a lot to do by yourself. Yeah. Okay. No, we got
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.000]   it now. So, here we go. We are ready to go. Question one. "I'm 24 years old and have been
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.060]   putting money into stocks every two weeks for about 18 months now. I know it's always
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.840]   a good idea to diversify between stocks and bonds, but right now, I'm all in stocks. As
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.040]   I'm young, I know that in the long run, the bear market is a good thing for young people
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.240]   like me. With the uncertainty of the market right now, do you think I should buy a couple
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.520]   of bonds, even if it's only $1,500 worth? Or would it be better to buy some of these
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.920]   stocks that are down significantly, and may list a couple of tickers, and seem almost
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.640]   certain to bounce back at some point, even if not for a while?"
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.760]   All right. Good on you. Yeah, good on you. 24 years old, dollar-cost averaging, invests
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.800]   every two weeks. That's a great plan for someone that age. Here's the thing. A lot of investors,
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.680]   investors approach the markets from the standpoint of, "What can I put my money in that can earn
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.840]   the highest rate of return?" Obviously, there's nothing wrong with trying to earn a high rate
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.960]   of return. That's the whole point of investing in the first place. But there are tons of
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.640]   other factors involved in trying to allocate what that next dollar is going to do for you.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.680]   There's this old saying in personal finance that when it comes to budgeting, you should
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.040]   give every dollar in your budget a job. Meaning, when you get your paycheck, everything should
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.000]   be allocated to something. Whether it's rent, car payments, student loan, utilities, phone,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.040]   Netflix, gym, savings, whatever. Everything should have a job and go to its rightful place.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.520]   I think investing should have a similar rule of thumb. And the main determinants are usually
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.320]   your time horizon and your goals. So, what's the point of this money in the first place?
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.840]   Are you saving for retirement? Is this going to be for a down payment for a house, a wedding,
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.760]   emergency fund? Is it going to go in a tax-deferred retirement account? Are you putting this in
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.280]   a brokerage account? When do you need to spend the money? So, it's not just what's the best
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.160]   use of this capital. It's what's the best use of this capital, given my circumstances,
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.240]   constraints, and goals, and then time horizon. So, I think once you begin looking at your
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.440]   investments through this personal lens, rather than a market lens, your job as an allocator
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.980]   becomes a lot easier. It's not just, "Well, what's the best risk-adjusted return between
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.800]   stocks and bonds right now over the next six to nine months?" You don't have to be a person
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.120]   on CNBC or a hedge fund manager that manages money this way in terms of, "What's the best
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.840]   risk-adjusted return right now?" It's, "What do you want to do with your money? How long
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.240]   do you want to invest it for? And what's the purpose of the investment in the first place?"
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.960]   And only once you have that figured out, then you can figure out where to invest it. And
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.600]   the great thing is, as an individual, you don't have these constraints of being marked
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.160]   against some benchmark, or risk-adjusted returns, or alpha, or whatever it is. That's a constraint
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.920]   individuals don't have. So, I would not try to make it so difficult in terms of, "What's
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.280]   the best thing right now over the next three to six to 12 months?" It's, "What's my time
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.200]   horizon? What's my risk profile? And then, what do I do with those dollars once I have
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.840]   that stuff figured out?"
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.680]   O'Reilly: Yeah, that sounds like good advice. I mean, they name some massive companies as
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.920]   potential stocks that they could invest in. I guess that's better than it being a bunch
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:43.280]   of former SPACs or something. Because, some of those might not come back, right? Whereas,
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.880]   you think the big ones, the blue chips, are going to come back at some point.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.280]   Lewis: And they could, but I wouldn't say they're certain to bounce back. There are
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.160]   stocks like, GE was the biggest stock on the planet for decades.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.000]   O'Reilly: With that dividend.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.200]   Lewis: Yeah. And that stock, since the turn of the century, has just gotten crushed. I
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.400]   think it's down 70-80%. And yeah, the dividend gets cut. And so, yeah, you'd assume those
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.000]   stocks are pretty safe. But, we don't know for sure. It's not certain.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   O'Reilly: Right.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.840]   Lewis: Alright, let's do another one.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:15.360]   O'Reilly: Up next, we have a question from Tanya. "I've been minimally invested in bonds
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.520]   as a long-term investor, but if I can get 5% or more interest, I'd love to allocate
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.960]   funds and lock that in for as long as possible. I'm looking at corporate investment grade
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.480]   and new issues, and they largely seem to be callable in a year. While I would be happy
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.040]   if rates came down and I got my principal back in a year, I'd also be happy holding
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.000]   them if they're not called and I keep earning the less competitive but acceptable coupon.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.300]   I'm anticipating bond index ETFs won't compete on yield over the next year with their current
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.040]   basket full of low coupon bonds until they mature and are replaced over time. Can you
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.440]   speak to the intelligence of buying individual bonds in today's market if an investor feels
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:56.440]   investment grade has acceptable credit risk and wants competitive yield short, or more
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.920]   ideally long-term, versus dividend or bond ETFs?"
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.840]   Lewis: Okay. As someone who has been writing about finance for a long time, I know there
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.480]   are always certain topics that people have very strong opinions about. Paying down the
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.560]   mortgage versus investing the money, the CAPE ratio, the Federal Reserve, of course, passive
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.120]   versus active, crypto, all these things. You write or talk about these things, and people
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.360]   have very strong views. I'm of the opinion that most financial decisions exist in a state
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.040]   of gray. There are very few black and white decisions. Most of it is gray, but a lot of
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.280]   people have very strong opinions. One of the ones that surprise me the most is that people
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.440]   have very, very strong opinions about buying individual bonds versus buying bond funds.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.600]   I wrote a piece about this in 2014, and my inbox was full of people saying, "You're an
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.720]   idiot," or, "You're right," or, "You're wrong," and people have very strong opinions.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.560]   Let me lay out the case for and against owning individual bonds. Here's the thing right now.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.620]   People think, "I buy an individual bond, and I hold it to maturity, so I get the regular
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:59.040]   payments of income every six months or a year, however, depending on the bond, determined
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.100]   by that initial yield, and then at maturity, I receive my principal back," which makes
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.680]   sense because a bond is a debt instrument, right? You're being paid back your original,
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:12.660]   so let's say you put $10,000 into a five-year U.S. Treasury bond. The yield's 4%. Every
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.240]   six months, you're going to receive $200, and then in five years' time, you're going
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.120]   to receive that $10,000 back, right? Now, the reason many people like holding individual
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.080]   bonds right now is because interest rates are up, and a lot of people say, "Well, my
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.240]   bond funds are getting crushed. I'm down 10% or 15% on bonds. If I just held individual
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.560]   bonds, I could just hold to maturity and get my principal back, and I wouldn't have to
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.840]   worry about any of these losses, and so even if rates move up and down in the meantime
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.760]   and my bonds are fluctuating every day when they're getting market-to-market, I still
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.440]   receive that par value at maturity." Now, here's the other side of that. Now, that makes
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.400]   some people feel really good and warm and fuzzy. Here's the thing. Bond funds literally
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.580]   hold individual bond securities that are market-to-market every day. How can a bond, how can a fund
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:02.600]   of individual bonds securities be any different than you personally holding individual bonds,
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.040]   right? This whole getting your money back at maturity might be a wonderful emotional
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.120]   hedge, but are you really any better off? When rates go up, the value of all bonds goes
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.800]   down, whether you're holding an individual bond or a bond fund, and while holding to
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.880]   maturity does allow you to get your money back at par, if the environment is higher
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.440]   rates and higher inflation, like it is now, you're going to still be getting back nominal
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.400]   dollars that are worth less at the time of maturity. So, let's say, for example, you
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.800]   own a bond fund that yields 2%, and then the yields go to 4%, which is basically what happened
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.320]   in a lot of bonds. If the duration of those bonds is five years, you would expect that
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.480]   fund to fall somewhere in the range of like 10% in value. That's happened to a lot of
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.800]   them. It's not any fun. Now, let's say, okay, I'm going to sell this bond fund, but I'm
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:47.920]   going to buy all the individual bonds in that fund, all the single issues, and those collectively
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.560]   now yield 4%. Are you really in a better position? Of course not. You're in the same exact place,
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.320]   right? Now, let's look at the other side. Let's say you own one 2% five-year bond. Rates
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.520]   go to 4% in that one bond. Sure, if you hold it, you get your money back at par, but now
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.440]   you're just earning 2% less than the market return. So, either way, you're going to be
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.120]   losing money. So, you could sell that bond at a loss and now buy the higher yielding
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.680]   4% bond, or you could hold it, yielding 2%, get your par back, but then you're earning
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:20.180]   2% less than. So, you're losing money either way. This is just how bond pricing works.
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.880]   There are no free lunches here. So, it's kind of the same thing. And it's a little bit of
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.520]   a pet peeve of mine that people think that holding them is like this holy grail of you
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.360]   don't have any losses, but it's the same thing. Having said all that, there are pros and cons
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.960]   to each approach. So, if you do hold individual bonds, you can potentially have higher trading
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.360]   fees, because on the bid-ask spread, it's harder. You're not PIMCO. You don't have trillions
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.280]   of dollars of bonds that you're trading. It typically requires more money in terms of
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.500]   minimums, depending on where you're trading. It's much harder to diversify, obviously.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.400]   In a bond fund, you can own hundreds or thousands of bonds. If you're buying them on your own,
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.680]   you might need a lot of money to do that. It's much harder to rebalance with single-issue
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.280]   bonds. But there is that peace of mind, if rates do change. Now, it's mostly in your
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:07.360]   own head, as I explained, but some people need that emotional hedge. The other thing
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.440]   is, if you own individual bonds, your duration and your maturity is constantly changing.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.120]   If you own a five-year bond, in a year, that's a four-year bond. In another year, that's
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.960]   a three-year bond. So, your duration and your maturity could be changing. A lot of people
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.720]   might get around this by owning a ladder of bonds to keep that constant, but that's kind
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.760]   of the same thing. There is much more complexity. Although, the one big positive, I think, besides
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.480]   the hedge of holding to par, is that it's much easier to match your assets with liabilities.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.360]   If you have something that you know you have to pay in five years, and you buy a five-year
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.400]   bond, you know at par you're going to get that money back. That's something that you
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.240]   can use to then invest when you need to spend that cash.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.680]   So, how about holding a bond fund? Bond funds are easier to diversify and rebalance. They're
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.640]   low in minimums. You do have to pay an expense ratio, which you don't have to for individual
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.580]   bonds. You have professional management trading them, and hopefully getting lower trading
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.040]   fees because of scale. You have that constant maturity and duration, because a lot of bonds
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:05.640]   are benchmarked, and they'll keep some sort of constant 1-3 year duration, or 3-5 years,
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:10.600]   or whatever it is. But it does make it harder to match assets with liabilities, unless you
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.240]   own different bond funds that have different types of maturity. So, obviously, each strategy
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.720]   has its pros and cons. And I didn't even get to the part about callable bonds here, which
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:24.400]   seems like that 5% yield might not be worth it, because that's just another added level
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.680]   of complexity if they do call the bond and bring it back to you. But the way I see it,
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.840]   you can get 5% to 6% in most corporate bond ETFs right now. So, I don't know if going
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:40.920]   to a 5% individual corporate bond really makes sense. I guess that depends on if you really
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.860]   need that emotional hedge. But, again, it probably depends on your tolerance for complexity
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:49.360]   and then how dependent you are on giving yourself that emotional hedge of holding bonds to maturity.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.480]   But again, maybe I'm going to get some more hate mail, but owning individual bonds is
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:58.580]   not different from owning a basket of individual bonds. It's just like owning a stock ETF is
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:03.840]   similar to owning individual stocks. Either way, your performance is going to be similar.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.920]   It could just depend how you can make it through those strategies.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:14.420]   So I have a question as a civilian non-financial professional. How do you even go about buying
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.560]   an individual bond? I don't even know where to begin, other than like high bonds.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.380]   You can do it at a brokerage. If you have TD Ameritrade or E*TRADE or whatever, you
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:26.520]   can buy bonds there, but the minimum might be $10,000 or $25,000, depending on the...
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.800]   So you have to buy it in some... $10,000 is probably the minimum for most places. But
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.760]   you can also go to Treasury Direct, which we've talked about, if you want to buy treasuries
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.960]   straight from the US government. I'm pretty sure there's no fees there. So you can do
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.120]   that. It's just your minimums might be a little higher than it would be for bond ETFs. But
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.080]   yeah, you can do it. And again, some people really like that peace of mind they get from
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:51.360]   buying individual bonds. I'm just here to tell you that it's mathematically... You still
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.520]   own bonds either way, whether it's a fund or an individual bond.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.000]   Right. Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.500]   That was kind of nerdy, but I think it's, I don't know, just a little pet peeve of mine.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.960]   We've had people write in before asking about being able to buy their own mortgage or stuff
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:11.360]   like that. People make this super complicated. Again, I think it's funny how people think
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.200]   that it's different. And again, bonds are driven more by math than the stock market
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.840]   is. But that's also why the movements in interest rates affect the prices of bonds you're going
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.520]   to buy in the future and the ones you hold now. It's not like you can all of a sudden
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.240]   find this bond that's paying more money and you get money back at par at maturity that's
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.240]   going to make you better off. It's not going to make you better off unless you can actually
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.160]   hold on to the strategy, I guess.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.120]   Cool. So that sounds pretty definitive. So I like that.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.520]   I'm putting this one to bed. That's what everyone... If you read a blog post, you say, "This is
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.720]   the definitive post about individual bonds versus bond funds."
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.720]   The only post you ever need to read.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.240]   And then people will still be arguing about it in a month. All right, let's move on.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:59.840]   Question three is from Aaron. "I adopted my son recently. Being in foster care before
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:05.080]   adoption means he'll get $400 a month until he turns 18. He's currently two. Plus he gets
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.960]   free college. What can I do with that money to turn it into a big chunk he'll get when
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.960]   he turns 18?"
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:16.840]   I honestly didn't know this either. I had to look it up a little bit. I think that it
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:21.360]   varies by state in terms of... But it sounds like that $400 per month is at a lot of states
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.880]   and also the scholarship piece for free college is a thing for foster care in a lot of states.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.960]   So I don't know where Aaron's from. But kudos to you, Aaron. I've talked about this before.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.960]   My wife and I went...
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.960]   Yeah, congratulations. First and foremost, right?
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.760]   Yeah, congrats. That's awesome. My wife and I went through IVF and it took a long time
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.840]   for that to work. And in the meantime, we went down the adoption path. And I will say
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.800]   our personal experience, it's not an easy experience. So I give Aaron a lot of credit
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.560]   for going through this and pulling it off because eventually the IVF worked for us.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.880]   But we went down that path pretty far and it's not easy. So here's the thing. Your son
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.840]   is two and he gets $400 per month until age 18. So we're talking 16 years of compounding.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:05.480]   My first rule here is just do no harm. If we're talking $400 a month, that's $4,800
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:12.920]   a year. And that's also what? $77,000 over 16 years, if my math is right there? That's
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:17.960]   almost $77,000. That's pretty good. So back of the envelope, if you've got a 5% return
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:23.360]   on that, we're talking, I don't know, $113,000. If you've got 7%, we're talking over $130k.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:28.360]   So that's real money. So unless the system completely falls apart, if you invest this
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:35.000]   in any sort of diversified portfolio of financial assets that aren't completely insane and some
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.080]   really smart 30-year-old billionaire walks away with them, I think you're gonna be okay.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.320]   So my one piece of advice would be just don't try to shoot the moon with this. Don't go
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.800]   like, "You're gonna be offering six figures to your son at age 18?" And that's an amazing
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:52.720]   gift. So I've talked about this before, but what I do with my three kids is a couple years
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.160]   ago, I opened up just a Lyft off account at Betterment, and I just make monthly contributions
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.640]   to diversified portfolio. And the account is technically in my name. I didn't want to
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.040]   get fancy because doing a Roth IRA for your child, unfortunately, is not very easy. They
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.240]   have to have some earned income. I think there's some back doorways around it, but I didn't
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.600]   want to go through that. So I just opened an account for myself in Betterment.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.200]   Does allowance count as income?
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:16.360]   Yeah, maybe the two's vary. So I just have a bucket for each of my three kids. I don't
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.720]   know why I'm gonna turn it over whether it's 18 or 21, but there's two reasons for this.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.620]   One is I save a little bit now, and I can give them a head start when they're adults,
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.920]   and then maybe for their first down payment or their wedding or buying a car or whatever
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.520]   it is when they need money when they first start out. But I also want to use these accounts
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.000]   to teach them about the power of compounding and dollar cost averaging. So I'm using these
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.720]   as a teaching tool to help them understand the importance of saving and investing. And
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.960]   I'm also trying to incentivize them to save. So I told my daughter when she starts getting
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.840]   money for birthdays and holidays or whatever, she gets $20, and I say, "Hey, if you put
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.480]   that $20 into your investment account, I'm gonna match it dollar for dollar." So you
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.200]   put $20 in, you get $40. So I've worked on her a little bit. She's putting like 50% of
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.320]   all her cash in there now, which is kind of great.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.320]   No two and 20.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:04.200]   Yeah, I'm not charging fees on that. So I think you could also do like a custodial brokerage
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.680]   account, but I think the best thing you can do is just dollar cost average this into
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.040]   some sort of diversified basket. Use that money as a learning tool. I was gonna bring
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.880]   him in for the next question, but let's bring our guest on for today, Kevin Young, who is
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.880]   an advisor with us at Ritholtz. Kevin, any other financial planning aspects I'm missing
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.160]   here in terms of taxes or accounts that you could use? Anything else I'm missing here
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.560]   besides the big building blocks?
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.360]   Yeah, Dave in the comments said, "Don't forget the taxes."
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.360]   Okay.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.240]   Yeah, that's a good point. I think broadly though, Ben, I'm in total agreement with you.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:44.480]   I think do no harm is a great way to put this. Low cost, dollar cost averaging every month,
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:50.680]   it's gonna be a home run. Couple of things to think about from a planning perspective.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:57.640]   I had never heard of this either. So upon some Googling, it seems like the rules vary
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:02.720]   state to state. And just make sure that while you might think, "Okay, college is taken care
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:08.880]   of. I'm all set." Just read the fine print and make sure you know exactly what that means.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:16.040]   Because if it means that it's free as long as they go to a state university and you live
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:22.160]   in Ohio and your child says, "I don't want to go to Ohio State. I want to go to Michigan,"
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.840]   let's say.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.960]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:32.600]   Nothing wrong with that. Then you're now in a bind because maybe that tuition is not covered.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:39.960]   So I think the UTMA accounts are a really good way to do it. The taxes piece of it,
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:46.680]   you do get a little bit of an advantage in that the first $1,100, I believe it is, there
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:53.000]   is no tax on it, the first $1,100 of gain. So whether that be capital gains or income
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.840]   or distributions from a fund you might invest in, the next $1,100 is taxed at your child's
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:04.200]   rate, which probably is going to be effectively zero. I think it's technically 10%, but effectively
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.600]   it's zero. And then over and above that would be at your rate.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:14.400]   So there is some tax advantage to that. The other piece is when they do reach age of majority,
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:20.160]   which it depends the state, it could be as low as 18, as high as 25, there's nothing
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.320]   stopping your child from getting access to that money outside of you basically hiding
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:31.560]   the account. But once that child does reach the age of majority, they call whatever custodian
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.640]   you have it at and say, "Cash me out. Send it to my bank account or send me a check."
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.760]   There's nothing stopping them.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.760]   Yeah. Which is probably why it makes sense to use it as a learning tool as well. So they
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.600]   understand this is a big responsibility when you get that much money at that age.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:51.000]   Exactly. But what it does at that point that just opening a brokerage account in your name
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.280]   and kind of just mentally putting that to the side for your child is if Ben's assumptions
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:03.200]   are correct, and let's say there's $130,000 in there at 18 or 20, whenever it is, and
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:08.200]   you want to give that money to your child, you've got gift tax considerations. Right?
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.960]   So we don't want to eat away at your exemption or as little as possible anyway. So by having
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.340]   the assets in your child's name, that avoids having to technically transfer those assets
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.360]   from you to the child.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.040]   So a custodial brokerage account might be the best option then?
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:29.680]   Yeah. I think that's a good way to go. And the only other consideration, again, with
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.200]   the college piece is if the child doesn't end up going to a school that would qualify
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:41.560]   for these tuition waivers or grants or however they're worked out, is that would be your
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.760]   student's asset. That would be your child's asset on student aid applications and things
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.760]   of that nature.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.260]   So things to keep in mind from a planning perspective, but I think you're in a great
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.820]   position to set your child up for a really great future.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.540]   Yeah. This was a cool one. I've never heard this before, so this was a neat question.
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.740]   It also made me feel old because I was just thinking like 18. I feel like maybe they should
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.620]   get it at like 21 or maybe 25. I don't know.
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:11.060]   You could just hide it. We get a lot of our clients come to us and they'll be 35 years
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:16.620]   old and say, "My parents just told me about this." So if you can beat the kid to the mailbox
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.460]   every day for the next couple of decades, that's one way to do it, I guess.
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.460]   That's funny.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.460]   Let's do another one, Duncan.
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:29.380]   Okay. Up next, we have a question from Charles. I have ulcerative colitis and know that I
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:33.940]   may not live as long as most other healthy people, but an online search shows most people
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:38.660]   of my condition have a normal lifespan of around 75 years. With new medical breakthroughs
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.280]   coming out every year, how should someone living with an autoimmune disease like me
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.820]   be thinking about life expectancy and how that relates to when we should retire? Is
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:47.820]   that even a consideration?
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.820]   This is a good one.
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:52.340]   Okay. Heavy question here. Yeah, heavy question, but a good question. I mean, death and taxes,
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.580]   right? Something we all have to live with eventually.
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:59.780]   Duncan, throw out my charts here. This is from Our World in Data. In 1800, the average
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:06.580]   life expectancy globally was 29 years old. Go ahead to 1950, we're talking global average
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:12.100]   of about 46 years old. By 2015, now we're talking 71 years old.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.820]   That is still a relatively new concept. In the past, most people simply just worked until
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:22.340]   they died. So, this longevity piece is something that a lot of people have to deal with. Kevin,
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.260]   you've built a lot of financial plans in your career. Most of the time, you're making an
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:30.540]   educated guess. You're going to retire at age 65. Based on your health data and family
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.900]   history, you could live to age 87, whatever it is. It sounds like Charles is going to
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.100]   be fine, but if he wants to plan for the potential for health problems and autoimmune disease,
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.980]   how do you even begin to take that into account when building a financial plan in terms of
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:47.140]   setting your time horizon, how much money you should spend, and how do you go about
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:51.260]   updating that as you get closer to old age?
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:56.460]   Yeah. This is a really good question, one I certainly haven't seen before, but one that
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:01.400]   we address constantly in financial planning. There's a couple of things that when we're
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.260]   building plans and we're talking to clients about this process, there's a few things we
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:11.820]   cannot control. One is what the markets are going to do, and two is how long you're going
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:19.780]   to live. Whether you have an autoimmune disease or disorder or you think you're going to live
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:27.420]   to 110 or anywhere in between, that is a piece that we just can't control. My default is
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:33.980]   I always run plans to age 95. Unless somebody is pounding the table saying, "No, no, no.
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.940]   All four of my grandparents lived to 102. It's going to be longer," or, "None of my
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:39.940]   grandparents."
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.680]   Duncan doesn't eat meat and he drinks oat milk, so he's going to live to 115.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:51.140]   Yeah. Duncan's going to have a very different portfolio than I will because I very much
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:26:01.860]   enjoy meat. Steak is a staple. But regardless of that, we want to be conservative in those
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:07.420]   assumptions in the sense that we want to assume you're going to live past some given date.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:12.420]   Because the last thing we want to do is plan for you to live to 82 years old and say, "Okay.
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:18.280]   Well, based on 82 and your withdrawal rate, you only need 5.2% rate of return. Great.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:22.380]   Let's build your portfolio that historically should average around 5.2%."
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:27.780]   Well, what happens if you live an extra decade? And if you run those projections, the rate
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:33.020]   of return that we might need might be 6.2%. So ultimately, I think being conservative
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:38.020]   with the projections on how long your retirement is going to last is a good way to do it.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:43.700]   Are you also a little quicker for someone in Charles' situation to say, "But if you're
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:48.500]   on the fence about a vacation home or a trip or whatever early on in your retirement, go
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.000]   ahead and do it and we'll build that into the plan because who knows what's going to
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   happen."
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:02.180]   Right. Right. Yeah. You also, as it's been said, you can't take it with you. So I think
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.820]   there's a book out now that's becoming more and more popular in our circles called, I
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.220]   think it's, forgive me if the title's wrong, but it's basically Dying With Zero. The idea
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.340]   that you can't enjoy this money once you're gone. And I think for a little bit of an older
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:19.460]   generation, it was always, "I want to leave my kids and grandkids money after I'm gone."
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:23.860]   Well, wouldn't you want to enjoy that money or see them enjoy that money instead? And
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:29.020]   so I think this kind of ties with that and that if you do have things you want to do,
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:33.420]   to bend your point, build it into a plan and see how it affects things in the long run.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:38.180]   And that's ultimately, I think, going to tell you, "Okay, this is how I should invest."
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:45.740]   I mean, generally speaking, we know that academically that equities should do better over the long
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.860]   term than almost any other asset class, at least any other common asset class. And so
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:53.020]   it makes sense that if you're going to have a really long retirement, that you're going
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:28:00.460]   to need to be maybe a little bit more equity-based than fixed income-based.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.460]   Good. All right, Duncan, last question.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:07.820]   Okay. I was just looking at that map again, that map that we shared. If you go back, you
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:12.700]   can pause and look at each of them a little longer, but it's pretty cool how much that's
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.700]   changed over the years.
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.660]   Yeah. And someone in the comments mentioned a lot of that was infant mortality, but we
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:22.580]   have now more people over the age of 65, I think, than under the age of 15 or something
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:28.860]   ridiculous like that. We've never had a demographic this big live this long before, and just getting
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.660]   longer every year. Okay, go ahead.
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:42.020]   Okay. So, last but not least, we have a question from Micah. "Looking for some help on how
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:46.540]   best to structure finances over the next few years. I'm currently working as an analyst
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:51.620]   at a bank with a relatively average salary. My wife is a third of the way through a three-year
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:56.100]   CRNA program. Once she finishes school, our household income will increase by roughly
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:02.620]   three to four times. At that point, we will both be in our late 20s." Wow, young. "I've
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.860]   been funding our Roths for the last few years, and I recently bumped up my workplace IRA
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.100]   to 10% to take advantage of current market conditions, but we are still taking on a decent
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:17.420]   amount of loans for her DNAP program. Obviously, the calculus would include comparing the loan
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:21.620]   rate to the expected rate of return if I were to prioritize the market, but I was hoping
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:26.460]   to get your guidance on what to truly prioritize over the next few years. What are some considerations
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.460]   for those expecting an income jump to keep in mind to best set themselves up for the
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.620]   long term?" They're really thinking about everything here.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:38.100]   Yeah, wife is in a nursing program, going to be making more money when she comes out,
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:42.620]   but she also has the debt to deal with. So, Kevin, with the caveat that there are no right
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.940]   or wrong answers to something like this, how do you help clients think through this type
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:49.460]   of decision where, "I'm going to be making more money, but I also have more financial
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:55.140]   responsibilities to deal with as well?" Yeah, I mean, ultimately, this is kind of
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:00.580]   what you hope for, right? You're making an investment in education that is going to bump
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:07.460]   your income up. And so, that's excellent. And clearly, we've got some forward-thinking
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:13.620]   folks here as far as what to be focusing on. And yeah, there is no right answer. Ultimately,
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:18.180]   I think personal finances, as you guys have said, as we've said a lot, it is personal.
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:24.120]   And so, what exists on a spreadsheet doesn't necessarily, and what makes sense on the spreadsheet
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.860]   may not make sense in your head or your stomach or your heart, right?
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:37.980]   And so, I have clients that have a 3% mortgage, and they are making extra payments to their
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:42.860]   mortgage to pay down the principal. And they've got 20 years left on the mortgage. Well, if
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:48.140]   we assume that over the next 20 years, the market is going to return more than that 3%,
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:51.980]   the spreadsheet, the math would suggest, you absolutely don't put more money into that
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:59.140]   mortgage. You put it in the market. But I also, those same clients say, "I feel better
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:04.700]   knowing that my debt is being paid down faster. I don't like debt. It makes me uncomfortable.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.900]   I want to get out of it as soon as possible." And so, yeah, the math says don't do that.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:14.540]   But ultimately, I think the plan that you can live with and the plan that makes you
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:19.740]   happy, as long as it doesn't derail the goal, is going to be the right answer.
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:25.820]   So, if you're somebody who, if you and your wife are people that really are uncomfortable
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:30.140]   with debt, you can tilt a little bit more of that income towards paying that debt down
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:36.220]   faster. If it's going to gnaw at you that this money should be invested and getting
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.580]   a higher rate of return, then that's the way to go.
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.380]   I also give them credit for, they've already been investing in their Roths while she's
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:47.960]   going to school. He's already, he's still contributing to his plan. My main thing about
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:52.980]   getting an income bump, if it's a bonus or a jump in income, I like the idea of doing
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:58.580]   some sort of allocation on it where you say, "I'm going to save 50% of this bonus or
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:02.980]   this jump in income, and the other 50% I'm going to use for debt repayments or increased
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:07.760]   savings." And so, some ways you give yourself a bump in standard of living, so it's not
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.940]   all for nothing. But then you figure out, "Okay, with 20% of this I'm going to repay
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.400]   debt, and the other 30% I'm going to save more." And sort of figure out some sort of
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.700]   set allocation there. And then you can kind of adjust going forward, depending on what
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:23.380]   happens. And as you guys get bumps in income going ahead in the future, since you're still
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:28.660]   pretty young, you can figure out which one of these made us happier. Is it growing our
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:32.940]   retirement accounts or paying off this debt and seeing it go down? So, I think splitting
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.260]   the difference in some ways can be a good way to test it out, doing an A/B test to figure
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.140]   out which one is going to make you happier anyway, because some people just don't know
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.140]   either.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:45.140]   Yeah, that's true. And I also think another thing to consider here is that it's always
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:50.860]   nice to have a little bit of extra liquidity, right? So, even if you are really hyper-focused
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:54.860]   on paying debt down, you don't want to get into a situation where you've paid your
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.060]   debt down and that's great, but you have very little liquid assets. And then something
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:04.020]   happens, something changes, a career change, God forbid, a disability, anything of that
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:09.500]   nature that while everything looks good on paper right now, and the trajectory is solid,
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.900]   you really want to make sure that you do have funds set aside for if things do change.
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.340]   Yeah, give yourself a margin of safety.
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:22.900]   Yeah, absolutely. And whether that's having six months to a year's worth of living expenses
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:28.180]   in cash or just knowing that, "Hey, I want to have some extra liquidity in a brokerage
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:33.820]   account if something changes." That's always a good thing to consider as well.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:39.740]   Perfect. Okay. No show next week because of Thanksgiving, obviously. It's too bad we're
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.580]   going to argue about what our favorite Thanksgiving sides are like they do on social media.
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.860]   I was hoping we'd have a political debate.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:49.660]   All right. Thanks to Kevin for joining us again. We always appreciate those insights.
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:50.660]   Yeah, thanks, Kevin.
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.660]   Thanks for having me, guys.
