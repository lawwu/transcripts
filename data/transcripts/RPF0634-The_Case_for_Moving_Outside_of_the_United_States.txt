[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:44.260]   ado.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:44.260]   There are a couple wrinkles that are unique about the US system of citizenship and taxation versus other countries of the world. There are four major systems of income taxation that exist in the world. They are, of course, citizenship-based taxation, which means that if you are a citizen of the country, you pay taxes based upon that citizenship. There are two countries in the world, to my knowledge, that currently have this system, the United States of America and Eritrea. There are countries in the world that have in the past had a system like this, but now they have a system like this.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:44.260]   There are countries in the world that have in the past had a system like this, but now they have a system like this.

[00:08:44.260 --> 00:09:14.280]  , and they have all gotten rid of those systems in favor of system number two, which is a residency-based taxation.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:14.280]   The majority of the large jurisdictions of the world outside of the United States are residency-based taxation systems.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:14.280]   Canada, Australia, Mexico, Germany, France, UK, etc. If you are a resident of those places, then you pay taxes based upon your residency, and you pay taxes on your worldwide income. US citizens, no matter where they live in the world, pay taxes on your worldwide income.

[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:45.300]   So instead of having a 40% tax bracket, highest tax bracket, they may have a 10% highest tax bracket.
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:51.300]   At the United States government, just simply taxed income at 10%, I would completely stop wasting any time on tax planning.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.300]   I'd pay the 10% and I'd go on about my life.
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:59.300]   It's where you get into 40% that it becomes worth it to waste all these hours and all this effort doing tax planning.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:04.300]   So there are many, there are countries in the world that don't impose more than 10 or 15% on income taxes.
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.300]   So you could just go and live there.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.920]   Or you can go and choose a country that has a system of tax planning.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:08.920]   Or you can go and choose a country that has a system of tax planning.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:08.920]   Or you can go and choose a country that has a system of tax planning.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:08.920]   Or you can go and choose a country that has a system of tax planning.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:38.960]   I think that's a good way to do that.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   You can go and choose a country that has a system of tax planning.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   You can go and choose a country that has a system of tax planning.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   Again, a territorial tax system is one where they only tax you on your income that is generated in that country.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   examples of these countries would be close to the United States the Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, down in Asia, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore, et cetera. You can live in any of those jurisdictions and as long as you don't earn money in those jurisdictions, you won't pay any taxes in those jurisdictions.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   I think that I think that I think that I think I've got a good idea that I don't have a good idea that I've got a good idea to go to do that I can live in those jurisdictions in those jurisdictions.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:46.000]   And if all of your income is sourced from the United States, you can live in Panama City and you won't owe the Panamanian government any money.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Or you could choose to a country that doesn't impose any kind of income taxation.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Good example here would be the Bahamas or the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands or Bermuda or the UAE.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   And there are a bunch of other gold states that don't have any income taxation because they run their governments based on the oil revenue.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   Or in Europe, Andorra or Monaco, et cetera.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   So you can become a resident of one of those countries.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   But by becoming either a bona fide resident of another place or just staying in one of those countries,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   You can become a resident of one of those countries.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   But by becoming either a bona fide resident of another place or just staying in one of those countries,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   You can become a resident of one of those countries,
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:39.040]  ,
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:39.040]  ,
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:39.040]   So you can eliminate all of the federal income taxes on your earned income up to about the first hundred thousand dollars that will save you $15,410 in federal income taxes. So I've just shown you how to legally eliminate $15,410 in federal income taxes. I've showed you how to legally eliminate $5,5,538 in New York State, and New York State, and the United States.
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:45.080]   taxes.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:45.080]   taxes.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.080]   taxes. And now the final piece of the puzzle is eliminating your employment taxes.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:47.080]   taxes. And now the final piece of the puzzle is eliminating your employment taxes.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.080]   taxes. And now the final piece of the puzzle is eliminating your employment taxes.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:49.080]   taxes. And now the final piece of the puzzle is eliminating your employment taxes.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:49.080]   taxes. And now the final piece of the puzzle is eliminating your employment taxes.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.080]   taxes. And now the final piece of the puzzle is eliminating your employment taxes. Your Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security taxes.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:51.080]   Your Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security taxes.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   Your Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security taxes. Because you'll be paying these either as an employee of a U.S. corporation or as a self-employed person.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   Your Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security taxes. Because you'll be paying these either as an employee of a U.S. corporation or as a self-employed person.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:13.120]   If you are an employee of a U.S. business, you'll be paying 7.65% as the employee and your employer will be spending 7.65% as the employer.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.120]   If you are an employee of a U.S. business, you'll be paying 7.65% as the employee and your employer will be spending 7.65% as the employer.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   If you are an employee of a U.S. business, you'll be paying 7.65% as the employee and your employer will be spending 7.65% as the employer.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.120]   If you are an employee of a U.S. business, you'll be paying 7.65% as the employer and your employer will be spending 7.65% as the employer.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.120]   If you are an employee of a U.S. business, you'll be paying 7.65% as the employer and your employer will be spending 7.65% as the employer.

[00:32:49.180 --> 00:33:17.200]   So at least you can qualify for social security disability if you become disabled. Or at least you can get Medicare, Medicaid if you get low income, etc. That's up to you. Now I personally think these taxes are a total waste. And my guess is that young people, our enterprising 25 year olds, is probably going to get something out of the system eventually. But it'll be one of the worst returns on investment imaginable. I always think of W. C. Fields famously said, "I spent half my money on gambling, alcohol, and wild women. The other half I wasted."
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:17.200]   So I look at it like this and say, "I spent half of my money on gambling, alcohol, and wild women. The other half I wasted."
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:17.200]   So I look at it like this and say, "I spent half my money on gambling, alcohol, and wild women. The other half I wasted."
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:45.240]  , and say, "At least if you stop spending money on employment taxes, and instead you gamble it all the way, or you drink it all the way, or you blow it all on licentious and concupiscent behavior, then you could hit the jackpot maybe if you're gambling. Or you might have some memories of good times to look back on."

[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:45.240]   So I look at it like this and say, "I spent half my money on gambling, alcohol, or you could hit the jackpot maybe if you're gambling. Or you might have some memories of good times to look back on."

[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.360]   Now, the system is not perfect.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.880]   Notice I've only talked about $100,000.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:30.520]   I haven't talked about a million dollars, because everything from $100,000 and up will still be taxed according to the standard federal income tax system.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.040]   There are a few additional things that you could do.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:38.840]   For example, there's a foreign housing deduction, which gives you a little bit of additional tax advantage money as well.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:38.840]   You can get foreign tax credits that you look at, but you're not going to be able to get a tax credit.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:38.840]   You can get foreign tax credits that you look at, but you're not going to be able to get a tax credit.

[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.580]   You'll still be paying taxes on those because those are not earned income.

[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:19.620]   But you can keep everything in the United States but eliminate this tax, your federal income taxes on your earned
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.620]   taxes on your earned income while you are abroad if you qualify for it and potentially
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:21.620]   taxes on your earned income while you are abroad if you qualify for it and potentially on your employment taxes.
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.620]   That could be really, really helpful to you.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.620]   And that literally could put $90 million in your income tax.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.620]   And that literally could put $90 million dollars in your income tax.
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:24.620]  , $90 million dollars in your income tax.
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:24.620]   I don't really could put $90 million dollars in your income tax.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:35.660]   So that's the first step.
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.660]   So if you're going to be going into the United States,

[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:55.700]   You can do that.
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.700]   You can do that.
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.700]   You can do that.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:58.700]   If you formally renounce your US citizenship, you can legally eliminate all of your US tax obligations,
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:37:59.700]   If you formally renounce your US citizenship, you can legally eliminate all of your US tax obligations,

[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.740]   You're not limited to only getting the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:31.740]   The foreign earned income exclusion only covers your earned income.

[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:36.740]   What if most of your income is investment income, interest income, dividend income, capital gains income?
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:36.740]   All of that is still taxed by the US government.
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:36.740]   All of that is still taxed by the US government.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:39:06.780]   I find that revolting.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:06.780]   I find that policy obscene.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:06.780]   It's the most un-American thing possible. You have a country that is based upon liberty, and yet now the US government is going to follow you around the world and say, no matter where in the world you earn your money, no matter what you do to make it, no matter if you've been in our country in decades, we're going to tax you.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:06.780]   No matter if you've been in our country in decades, we're going to tax you.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:06.780]   We snoop in all your money.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:06.780]   no matter if you've been taxed your income.

It may be better for you to simply be an accountant in Miami, living inexpensively in Miami because things are inexpensive, and although you're paying some federal income taxes, you can obviate those with your 401k contributions and with your sideline business deductions, etc. So don't think this is the only way to do it. It's not. But you should calculate it. Calculate your personal returns from leaving.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:44.480]   The first thing you need to do is calculate your personal returns from leaving.
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:59:13.280]   Pull out your tax returns.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:13.280]   Look at your federal, state, local tax returns.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:13.320]   Look at your employment tax information.
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:13.360]   How much are you paying this year in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid costs?
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:13.420]   And then calculate that cost from now to retirement and now to your death.
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:13.480]   What would that cost if you could eliminate it?
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:13.480]   Could that benefit you?
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:13.480]   Could you set up a lifestyle that wouldn't subject you to a life that would not be a life that you would want to live?
