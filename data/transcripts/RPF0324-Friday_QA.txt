[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900]   It's Friday. On Fridays we do Q&A shows. Basically, you call in with questions and
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.560]   I do my best to come up with some kind of helpful answer. Of course, you've got to
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.560]   be the judge of how truly helpful it is.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:35.840]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.660]   Thank you for being with me today. This is the show where we're dedicated to providing
[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.360]   you with the knowledge, skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.020]   meaningful life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.240]   If you're a patron of the show, you get access to a Friday Q&A call. That's the very best
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.520]   way if you've got a specific question that you'd like to get some input on for you to
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.800]   get a hold of me.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.160]   As we head over to the conference call line here, it looks like I've got a total of four
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.440]   callers lined up. I know what a couple of them want to talk about. I just want to mention
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.320]   to you if you would like to ask a question, if you'd like to steer the content of these
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.040]   shows, the best way to do that is to become a patron of the show. As a patron of the show
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.160]   at a certain level, you get access to the conference call line. You can call in and
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.200]   you can ask a question. I don't screen the calls, so if you want to catch me out or ask
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.280]   me something interesting or see if you can stump me, this is the very best way for you
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.280]   to do that.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.440]   Right now, I've got four callers on the line. Let's go and jump first to Eric from Georgia.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.800]   Eric, go ahead with your question, please.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.240]   Thanks, Joshua. What are some hands-on investments in the $1,000 to $10,000 range? When I think
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.480]   of hands-on, I'm thinking of real estate. I can purchase the real estate, go to the
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:00.160]   property, fix it up and meet my tenants. I consider stock index fund investing hands-off.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.640]   I want to do more of that hands-on investing, but it seems like most people only talk about
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.560]   relatively affordable stocks or on the other side, the relatively expensive real estate.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.600]   Do you have any ideas for lower cost hands-on investments?
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:23.360]   Why do you want to do hands-on investing?
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:33.880]   It really comes from your podcasts and your philosophy of trying to get out of the market.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.880]   I know you have your specific reasons for that. I like those reasons. I do own one rental
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.760]   property and I really enjoy that hands-on aspect of that, of being able to go fix things
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:54.440]   when I need fixing to in a sense touch my investment as opposed to just hope that companies
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.080]   do well with whatever money I invest with them.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.160]   The reason I ask the question is we should start first always with the why. If we're
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.040]   going to do extra work, why? There could be a few different reasons. For example, you
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.800]   mentioned, "Well, I might not be comfortable. I might not want to invest in this certain
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.280]   vehicle over here and so therefore I'm choosing something else." If you're going to get
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.200]   involved in the world of active investing where you're actually putting your time
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.080]   and energy into it, the only rational – well, the major rational reason for you to do that
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.320]   would be if you could earn higher returns. So that's kind of the why that I would encourage
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.320]   you to consider first.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.160]   If you could trot down to the bank and buy a guaranteed one-year CD and they pay you
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.080]   a 10% annual rate of return on that CD, well, if you're comparing that 10% annual rate
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.240]   of return on the CD to the hands-on investment and you're calculating that I could do this
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.560]   work but basically I'm going to wind up with a 10% rate of return, there would be
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.640]   no rational reason for you to do all the work of say finding another rental property.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.340]   So with that as just a basic foundation, the major reason you're going to be looking
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.320]   for something is so that you can increase your returns. So you've got to find – the
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.520]   ideas on how to invest in this active way is going to be where do you see an opportunity
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.400]   to invest your cash and your time in such a way that you can get returns that are to
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.000]   a very – that are much higher than what's available in a passive world.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.320]   This is the fundamental distinction if we were just to restrict our conversation to
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.960]   active mutual funds and passive mutual funds, the biggest conversation that goes on in the
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.560]   personal finance world. Usually those who argue in favor of passive investing are not
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.680]   saying that an active investment manager can never beat the market. What they usually are
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.160]   saying is when you take into account the costs of potentially beating the market, they can't
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.920]   do it in excess of the costs, the costs of research, the costs of the time, the costs
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.960]   of the work of the investment manager.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.200]   So we can apply that same thing to your and my individual investment activities and say
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.860]   if we're going to invest actively, we've got to get returns that are going to be in
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.320]   excess of the costs, the costs of the time, the costs of the energy, the costs of whatever
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.920]   specific things we need to spend money on.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:19.360]   Now you are already investing in – you have one specific rental property. Are you specifically
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.400]   looking for tools and strategies and ideas that are related to real estate or a more
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.400]   general question?
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.520]   Yeah, a more general question I guess just a way to have – I guess just be more diversified
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:40.640]   as well but without having to drop a lot of money on a second rental property or other
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:47.080]   real estate, just kind of looking for more things in a lower price range but that have
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.080]   that hands-on feel of the investment.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.560]   What type of work is your job or your business?
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:04.760]   I do website development and it's my own company. So I invest in that in a sense of
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.560]   investing in the business.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.640]   Have you exhausted all of the areas of investment that you see there or is there something there
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.840]   within the context of your own business that you could employ the money in?
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:27.880]   Yeah, I could probably employ the money in that probably mostly on the education side,
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.080]   learning new skills and improving that way.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.120]   So that's probably going to be your best opportunity. Let me give you a simple example.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:45.120]   Let's just say $1,000 or $1,000 to $10,000. You could – and I'm using this as a real
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.000]   example but also as a metaphor. You could go and buy a hot dog cart and sell hot dogs
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.040]   from that hot dog cart on the weekends and the evenings. That would be a legitimate form
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.080]   of investment. That would be an active business basically that you're functioning in but
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.240]   that would be a legitimate form of investment and you could do that in that $1,000 to $10,000
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.300]   budget range that you talked about.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.080]   So why wouldn't you do that? Well, the reason you wouldn't do that is if you had a better
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:20.240]   use of your time and money elsewhere and usually, the best place for us to invest our time and
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:27.640]   money is into our primary career. Now, what hampers some of us is within the context of
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:34.440]   employment, some of us have more upward mobility options and some of us have fewer upward mobility
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.440]   options.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.360]   If you are running your own company, whether that's a solopreneur endeavor or whether
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.720]   that's just you and a few employees, you probably have a lot of options and areas around
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.940]   you through which you can invest and that will probably be the most productive thing
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.980]   for you to do. I don't know if this is applicable to your business. So again, take this metaphorically
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.640]   and apply it to whatever is appropriate in your specific situation.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.280]   But if you're looking at your business and you're saying, "I develop software or websites
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.080]   or I do this IT work and I could really use the services of a graphic designer," then
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:14.080]   perhaps the $5,000 that you desire to invest would be most effectively invested into buying
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.160]   a new computer, putting it into a corner of the office and bringing in a part-time graphic
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.780]   designer to work on it and operate it. Then perhaps by adding that additional capability
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:29.440]   and skill to your company's offerings, you'll be able to provide more of a one-stop solution.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.440]   That's the type of investment that we should usually be primarily looking for. If you didn't
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.080]   have your own company or even if you do, you would be looking to say, "Is there an opportunity
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.000]   for education that I need?" You mentioned that. "Is there an opportunity for networking
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.360]   that I need?" That would be something that I would look for. A thousand dollars might
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.480]   be effectively used by going and signing up for an industry conference or going and finding
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.400]   somebody who is a real leader in the field and asking them to study with you and perhaps
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.560]   – excuse me, to study with them. Perhaps the best use of the $3,000 of cash is for
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.720]   you not to go to your office every day for a week but rather to fly across the country
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.680]   and spend a week with somebody who's a real leader in the field and observe what they're
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.440]   doing. You may come home with a notebook filled with ideas and possibilities of ways to improve
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.160]   your business. Now, that is usually going to be the highest
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:27.780]   returning investment for most of us. However, we can't always stay with that. So depending
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.840]   on what phase you're in, perhaps you've done some of those investments. Perhaps your
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.800]   business is working well and now you're looking to diversify out of your business
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.240]   or your job. Now you need to look at the market around and say, "What am I trying to accomplish?"
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.400]   So let's pretend that you've done all those things and take the example a little farther.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.920]   You've invested in your business. You've bought that computer. You hired that employee.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.520]   You're getting new revenue. You went ahead and hired the bookkeeper, that freed up time.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.960]   So now you've got more time and now you've got some excess money.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.360]   Now you're looking and saying, "I've got some capital and I want to invest the
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.000]   money." But the business is working well and you're concerned about a change in the
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.280]   marketplace that's going to affect your business and you're not exactly sure how
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.680]   you are going to reposition yourself to compete with it. You're manufacturing buggy whips
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.040]   and buggy whips are quickly going out of style because people are buying cars.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:23.800]   Well, you might want to hedge against that by saying, "I need some other type of investment
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.760]   that's not correlated to my primary business." So when I was actively managing investment
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.680]   accounts for clients, I didn't want to have all of my investments invested in the stock
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.800]   market because if the stock market were to decline dramatically, that would dramatically
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.680]   affect my personal compensation because all of my clients' accounts would decline.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.840]   That would affect my compensation and that would also at the same time affect my investment
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.960]   accounts. So I would really be feeling the pinch if all of my money were invested in
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   stocks.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.880]   Now of course I had to have some money invested in stocks. Otherwise, I would probably be
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.480]   a bit of a hypocrite to my clients when they ask, "Well, how do you invest?" and I
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.000]   say, "Well, I don't buy stocks." That would be a problem. But I have to protect
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.240]   from that risk. So that's where then you look and you say, "Now, how do I invest
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:15.000]   this capital?" and if you have time, then maybe you buy a food truck or a hot dog cart
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:26.080]   or maybe you take something like that, some type of simple business and you can invest
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.080]   that.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:33.320]   You can – specifically on the topic of investing, you can flip all kinds of things. So for example,
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.900]   if I had $1,000, I would probably not – and I didn't have any skill or experience to
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:43.000]   point to. I would probably not be looking to flip real estate. I would be looking to
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:51.240]   flip lawnmowers or washing machines or something in my area where I could see that I can purchase
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.640]   this item over here for cheaper and flip it for more.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:00.200]   I know people who flip cars and they do four, five, six cars a year. They have perhaps – sometimes
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.640]   they have a little mechanical ability. They get a dealer's license. They go to the auction.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.320]   They buy some cars for cheap. They shine them up, fix them up and they flip them and they're
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.080]   making a few thousand bucks on every car. Well, that's a dramatic rate of return that
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.800]   is a lot higher than what they're going to make if they just passively invested the
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   money.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.520]   But you have to do it based upon the scale where you're at and the skills that you
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:27.120]   have and the time that you have to invest. So that would be my way of answering it is
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.320]   more conceptual. I don't – practically it sounds like an answer to your question,
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.920]   Eric. It's going to be your business at this stage.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.080]   But then perhaps in the next stage, it will be something different. So be aware of what
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:43.600]   those skills are. For you, maybe it's flipping computer systems. If you only had $1,000 to
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:49.520]   invest and you could buy computers at 50 bucks, tweak a few things and sell them for 150,
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.680]   that would be a great rate of return but it's a lot more time-intensive.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:00.760]   So as the investment capital grows, you have to adjust the things that you invest in so
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.040]   that you can still produce higher returns because you have so much capital. You can
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.440]   invest $1,000 in computers and flip them possibly, maybe. I don't know if that's actually
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.160]   true but you would know that. But it would be really tough for you to figure out how
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.640]   to invest $100,000 in used computer systems and flip them.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:24.440]   So it's the basic concept and idea of investment and you've got to look in your local area
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.720]   based upon your situation, your skills, your time, your markets and just be aware of the
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   opportunities and the answer will probably present itself.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.640]   Helpful, Eric? Any follow-up question to that?
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.920]   Yeah. No, very helpful. Thank you very much.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.000]   Good. Denise, you're next.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:49.560]   Thanks, Joshua. So I am looking for suggestions for prioritizing competing goals and by this
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:54.320]   I mean I'm a true sandwich generation. I have two children, one in college, one going
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:14:00.200]   in four years, but I also have an older parent who I have to plan to care for. So I'm trying
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:06.480]   to balance the competing goals of savings, building emergency funds, saving for retirement
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:13.040]   with the goal of eliminating debt, paying off credit cards, student loans and I anticipate
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.200]   in the next three to five years I'm going to need to purchase a home that can accommodate
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:25.000]   my mother. My current home just cannot do it. I need a first floor disability accessible.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.600]   So I'm trying to balance those three goals, trying to figure out which I should work on
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:36.480]   because I look at them as sort of all being urgent and within the next two to three years
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.600]   I need to really work on things. So I just appreciate some thoughts.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.960]   Tell me a little bit more about your current financial situation. Are you – you're working
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.200]   to pay off debt, save an emergency fund or you're well established in some of those
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.440]   basic steps?
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:56.200]   I'm working on all of those things. I have money in a 401(k). I think I'm a little bit
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:01.280]   ahead of the game on that. I have a bit of an emergency fund. It's probably at this point
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.720]   probably about one to two months, so I certainly want to bulk that up. At the same time, most
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.120]   recently I've been really focusing on trying to pay off my credit card debt, get all of
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.440]   that out the way so that I can have more money to use for other things.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:22.440]   Is it just your mom you are caring for or going to be caring for?
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.000]   Yes, it's my mom. I'll be caring for. And just to tell you one more thing, I have a
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.040]   high income. I'm an attorney.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.040]   Great.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:37.120]   But, well, I actually probably want to transition to a different career in the next, say, five
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.360]   to seven years, and I anticipate that'll be a much lower paying career. So that's something
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.000]   that's on the backbone that I have to consider as well.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.800]   Okay. And what level of care does your mom presently need?
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.600]   Currently she's fine on her own, but I anticipate, like I said, three to five years I'll need
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:16:00.800]   something that's a little more accessible. And my home, current home, just can't be reconfigured
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.400]   for that. I need something with no stairs.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.740]   Is she physically healthy and you're just planning for her advancing age, or is she
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.960]   showing indications of beginning stages of dementia, something like that?
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.880]   Oh, no, nothing like that, but just more physical. She has knee issues. She uses a cane. So I'm
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:26.800]   anticipating a little bit more of a decline in that respect, but otherwise healthy.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.360]   Okay. A couple of ideas occur to me. It's a good question. I think it's a challenge
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:41.200]   that we all have as far as we always have competing goals. I bought some paddle boards
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.920]   this week, and some of the audience have been yelling at me to get them for a while, but
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.300]   I bought some paddle boards this last Saturday. And I didn't necessarily have to buy them,
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.760]   but I chose to not save and invest the money that I chose to spend on my family.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.740]   And I have thought about it for years. I've considered it for years. I was just shopping
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.240]   the market. I was never willing to pay the money that people wanted to pay for them,
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.640]   but I finally reached a point in time where the prices had come down. I found a deal that
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.480]   worked and I'm at a phase in my family life where those paddle boards are going to be
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:14.780]   really useful. I don't know that I can create an academic model. It's just simply that by
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.960]   being aware of what you're giving up, you can start to look at some things.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:25.560]   So here would be some ideas that I would suggest for you. First, you can think about it in
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:31.600]   terms of concentric circles of responsibility. If you are not stable yourself, you're not
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:39.160]   able to be of any help to anybody else. I've said it as a joke and some people are offended
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:44.720]   by it, but I think it's in many ways true that the best way to help the poor is to start
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.560]   by not being one of them. It's only people who are financially stable and who have money
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.600]   who are able to help others on financial topics.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:59.920]   So our first responsibility is always to care for ourselves. I need to care for myself first
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.720]   and then I need to care for my family, which is the stage that you're at. But if your mom
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:11.560]   is presently able to take care of herself, you need to focus first on taking care of
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:17.960]   yourself. So I wouldn't give a major amount of focus to saying I'm going to do certain
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:23.600]   things – so I wouldn't set aside extra money for the care of my mom in the future
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:29.160]   if I'm currently saving up an emergency fund and paying off debt for myself. So you've
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.400]   got to care for yourself first.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:39.520]   Then once you are in a solid and stable place or as your financial stability increases,
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.360]   you'll be able to be of more help to other people. The cool thing about finance is the
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:51.040]   things that you do for yourself are also the things that are going to prepare you to be
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:58.400]   effective for helping your mother and your children. So focus on you first, recognizing
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:04.200]   that everything you do for you is also going to equip you to be able to help others.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.160]   So that's the idea of concentric circles. Start with you and spread out. Don't worry
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.040]   about caring for the orphans in Africa until you first cared for the orphans next door
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.840]   and then you can't care for the orphans next door until you've cared for yourself
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.800]   and taken care of that.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:28.200]   The second thing is look to see what the opportunities are. So with your kids, are you paying for
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.240]   their school? Have you promised to pay for their school? What are your obligations or
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.560]   what commitments have you made to them with regard to that?
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:43.920]   I purchased a Virginia 529, so I told both of them, "I'll pay for your first year
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:50.760]   of school. After that, you need to seek scholarships and if necessary, take loans." Certainly,
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.400]   I would like to help them as much as possible, but I recognize that I've heard the saying,
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.960]   "They can borrow for their education, but I can't borrow for retirement." So I've
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.920]   sort of limited it to that. And fortunately, my older daughter that's in college now
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:09.360]   has a tuition scholarship, so she won't need to borrow for her room and board. My
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.360]   younger daughter, we have a little time. She's in high school.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:22.880]   Great. So if I were you, given my opinions, perspectives, and I guess just awareness of
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:29.200]   the world, which are not going to be yours, but if I were you, I would not prioritize
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:35.960]   trying to save money or allocate money towards my kids' schooling. Any person who is desirous
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:42.880]   of getting a college education can put themselves through school simply by working and studying
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.700]   at the same time, absent any scholarships, absent any financial aid, absent any tuition.
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:54.040]   If your children want to get a college degree, the best way that you can help them is to
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:58.420]   simply provide a place for them to live rent-free if they're being responsible with their
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.360]   studies and they can go and they can work a minimum wage job and put themselves through
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.120]   college. And if you remove simply the cost of rent from their life, there's no reason
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.860]   why anybody who wants to can't work their way through school.
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:16.220]   To me, I don't see the point of anybody paying a lot of money for college degrees.
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:21.000]   And I certainly wasted a lot of money on my college degree and that the biggest waste
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.120]   was on that room and board. So if you can help your children, and you can do this without
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.640]   saving any money just by budgeting it in, help your children stay at home, live with
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:35.400]   you. They can do the first few years of schooling online for very cheap or they can go to a
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.360]   local community college or they can just go to a university that is nearby. Or if they
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.480]   want, they can do the work that's required to get a bunch of scholarships and have somebody
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.200]   else pay for their school if they really want to do it.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.120]   And then in the worst case scenario, if they do borrow money, that's up to them. They
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.600]   can easily borrow money for school. I think it's a foolish thing to do but they can
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.440]   easily borrow money for their schooling. So as a parent, I don't think you have any
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:03.880]   responsibility or moral duty or obligation to pay for your kid's college education.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:09.040]   A lot of parents feel they do. And if you do, you have to address that. But I don't
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:14.800]   see any reason whatsoever why any parent has a moral duty or obligation to pay for the
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.560]   kid's college. You can let them live at home. They can work a minimum wage job and
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.480]   they can put themselves through school. It's not that expensive to get a college degree
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.480]   here currently.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.840]   It's much more important for you to care for yourself and also to be prepared to care
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:36.400]   for your mom than it is for you to set aside money for your kid's college. So even if
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.560]   they did borrow money and even if they did have to pay that back, they've got a lifetime
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:45.120]   of earnings before them. So if I were you, I would focus on me and I would focus on caring
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.560]   for mom.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:51.560]   And the final comment that I would make with regard to being prepared to care for mom,
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:58.640]   it probably will not involve a lot of money. So it probably – just based upon what you
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.120]   said to me, it's probably not going to involve a lot of money. It's probably going to involve
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:06.760]   your simply moving and adjusting to a different place to live in the future.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.520]   But you could probably adjust from where you are living to a different place to live that's
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.960]   simply more suitable for your circumstances without spending a lot of money. If you have
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.680]   to sell your place and buy another place or sell your place and rent another place, you
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:25.840]   could probably find something suitable similar to what you're paying right now, especially
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.320]   if you have a bedroom that's freed up with a kid moving out.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:35.440]   I've cared for – I cared for my grandparents when I was younger and my parents were caring
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.960]   for them. Depending on the ages of your children and your mom, sometimes, yes, you do need
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.840]   a bigger house. But if she's independent right now and then if at some point in the
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.080]   future you join your households together, remember she's going to be bringing income
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:55.340]   to the table. So that income can be planned on to meet the needs.
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:01.180]   So if I were you, given what you said about the career, I would focus on saving some cash,
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.960]   getting out of debt, freeing yourself up, building an appropriate career that's going
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.540]   to give you the flexibility that you need and the earning power because the biggest
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.060]   thing you'll need with – if you wind up in a position where you're providing physical
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.580]   care for your mom is you'll either need a lot of money or she'll need a lot of money
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:21.660]   to pay for professional caregivers or you'll need flexibility and help to actually provide
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:26.380]   the care. It's primarily the flexibility that will be the most benefit to you, especially
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:31.660]   if she's healthy. If your mom were facing a severe end-stage form of dementia, that
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:36.500]   type of care is very difficult. But just occasional care, she's weakening, she needs some help
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.260]   with cooking, those are things that you can integrate into your lifestyle without a lot
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:45.460]   of excess – not a lot of excess money. You just need some time and flexibility. Those
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.420]   would be my answers. Helpful, Denise? You want to ask a follow-up question? Is that
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.420]   good enough?
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.220]   No, that was incredibly helpful. Thank you very much.
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.220]   Good. Thank you. Next, Joe.
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:25:02.180]   Hey, Joe. Excuse me. Hey, Joshua. If I take a job with a 501(c)(3) as a contractor, I'll
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:08.460]   have an opportunity to enroll my 401(k) into a 457(b). My understanding on this is that
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:13.580]   there's no 10% penalty on early withdrawals from a 457(b). So I'm wondering if this
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:20.740]   is a valid strategy for accessing 401(k) money penalty-free before age 59 and a half without
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:27.260]   committing to a 72(t) or waiting five years for a rock ladder to kick in?
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:33.580]   That is a good question, Joe. Are you planning on retiring early before 59 and a half?
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:40.100]   Yes, definitely. Looking at unjobbed mostly, I'm sort of very illiquid right now with
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:45.980]   most of my money in 401(k)s and minor A's.
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:26:00.580]   Okay. Trying to think here. I am not sure of the answer, Joe, and I don't know the answer
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:09.540]   to that. Have you found anybody online who's written about that or talked about that previously?
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:15.300]   No, no. That was sort of the genesis of calling in. I Googled the heck out of this and couldn't
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:22.140]   find anything. On the IRS publication, it seemed to suggest that 401(k) to 457(b) was
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:29.100]   a valid transition, but there was some footnote about requiring separate accounts, and I wasn't
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:38.340]   sure if that was somehow related to trying to prevent this strategy I was thinking about.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:45.540]   I'm sorry. I can't confidently say whether it's one way or the other. If the 457(b) – so
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:52.500]   let me give you a short answer and let me add that to my things to research and try
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:27:02.860]   to determine an answer and publish a researched answer. If you can – if the 457 will accept
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:09.740]   the transfer in, then there's the technical legal answer and then there's the practical
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.740]   answer.
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.900]   So I don't know the answer to the technical legal answer. I'm giving you just the practical
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:21.500]   answer. If the 457 will accept the transfer in and if the 457 allows distributions from
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:30.860]   assets, there's no – practically, it would work. There's no – the people who are
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:36.500]   running these plans are not generally – they're not going to be all that knowledgeable about
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.500]   this.
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.780]   So if you can actually get the money in without paying taxes and things like that and if the
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:45.420]   money is seasoned and it's in the 457, you start taking distributions, it's unlikely
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:49.940]   practically that anybody is ever going to – that it's ever going to be a problem.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.900]   So if the funds allow that transfer, then I would say practically you could probably
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.900]   do it.
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.580]   Now technically, I don't know but I don't see any reason why if the 457 would accept
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:05.980]   the fund and if you've proven that, why it wouldn't be possible. But I'm hesitant
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.900]   because it would seem to me that I would have heard about it and I've never heard this
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:10.900]   idea.
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:16.180]   So I'm useless to you, Joe. Let me – I've made a note of it. I will research it and
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:22.380]   I will try to do my best to get an answer and please do me a favor. Email me, Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.420]   and let me know that it was you.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:29.660]   If I can determine the answer, I will personally tell it to you and if I can get the clear
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:34.340]   answer where I'm confident, I'll go ahead and share it on the show in a future episode.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:37.900]   But send me an email after our call and I will follow through on it.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.700]   Joe Fossum All right. I appreciate it.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:46.180]   Marc Thiessen For sure. All right. We've got three more callers. Let's go with – who's
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:58.780]   next? 856-AREACODE, please. Looks like a Philadelphia number, 856. Go ahead with your question,
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:04.860]   please. All right. We'll go on to the Arizona number, 520-AREACODE, please.
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:10.860]   Julian Julian, go ahead.
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:15.780]   Joshua Julian Thanks, Josh. I've been struggling
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:25.340]   a little bit with a particular situation with a 401(k) profit sharing and cash balance pension
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:31.500]   plan match. My life is a little bit shaken up based on getting married and going on a
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:37.420]   honeymoon and then also moving all within a few months. By the time the dust settles,
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:44.500]   I'll only be a couple months away from being fully vested for a three-year vest period.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:52.660]   About seven months away, I could theoretically transfer within the company to, I guess, finish
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:30:00.420]   out the three-year timeframe to get the matching contributions while at the same time I'm evaluating
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:08.060]   just moving on altogether to greener pastures, if you will. I think that moving would provide
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:14.460]   a clean break to do that, but I'm trying to evaluate the opportunity cost of those
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:20.700]   matching contributions for the past two years against the opportunity cost of having a fresh
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:25.100]   start and moving on to something and starting that sooner rather than later.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:29.060]   How much money are we talking about?
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:35.060]   It wouldn't be a significant amount of retirement savings. It wouldn't derail me altogether,
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:41.060]   but I'm just really thinking about the opportunity cost 30-35 years later, looking back and thinking
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:46.420]   about what it could have been. Depending on bonuses and other pay between now and when
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:51.780]   I leave, I would say it's going to be between $7,500 and $10,000.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:57.620]   If you were to leave right away, what type of opportunity would you be going to?
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:03.380]   Something that makes more sense given my skill set and my career aspiration. I've been with
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:09.060]   the company a while and it's been a rocky path, if you will. It's a little bit difficult
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:16.200]   to find my true calling within the company. I've been able to make it work, but I've consistently
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:22.280]   been trying to find other opportunities. I haven't found anything that was worthwhile
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:27.560]   to jump for, but with the move, I technically have to find another job within the same company
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.600]   which if I'm going to do that, I could also just spread that out to working for other
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.600]   companies.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:40.160]   For my clarity, you have gotten married and you have moved or you have a specific deadline
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.120]   where you're going to move for certain and that's what's causing the question?
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:55.080]   Exactly. Based on my wife's job, the move is in September. By then, if I were to transfer,
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:01.160]   if I can do that which I think that I can, then I would be seven months from this three-year
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:05.800]   like cliff fast on both retirement plans.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:13.840]   If you were to leave this company completely, would you go to a company in a similar industry
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:18.840]   or similar occupation or would you completely switch industries?
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:26.000]   Same industry. Probably the role itself would be similar in scope, but the company would
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:33.400]   be quite a bit different, sort of a different type of company within that same industry.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:38.440]   It wouldn't be an occupation change at all.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:44.600]   Final question before I give you my thoughts. Is $7,500, is that a significant amount of
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:52.360]   money as compared to your annual compensation and your investments or is it relatively insignificant?
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:33:03.000]   That's kind of tough. I think I struggle with that because I'm thinking back on the amount
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.160]   of time it took to get those matching contributions. A little bit of back story, I did sort of
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:15.000]   a similar thing with another company where I was a six-year. I left earlier. Obviously,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   I was far off from working there six years, but I left some money on the table and I still
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.720]   look back at that and think to myself, "Well, that would have been nice. That would have
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.640]   been helpful to my overall retirement, obviously to my overall net worth." I wouldn't say it's
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:36.800]   significant, but it's not like I would burn that amount of money if that makes any sense.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:44.720]   In theory, without having a specific idea, without having a specific opportunity to compare
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:49.840]   it to, you're not going to be able to come up with the right answer because right now,
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:56.480]   you're basically trying to calculate something, the $7,500, as compared to nothing. You don't
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.520]   have the opportunity lined up. You don't have the job, et cetera. You're not going to be
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:05.120]   able to make that as a clear decision. Something is better than nothing.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:14.760]   $7,500 or zero, well, I'll take $7,500. That's why you're experiencing such an emotional
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:19.120]   cognitive dissonance about it because you don't have anything that you're actually comparing
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:27.680]   it to. Again, you're trying to compare something to nothing. That's the major problem. I don't
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:34.880]   think there's anything magical about retirement accounts or vesting, et cetera. The concept
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.060]   is golden handcuffs and you're experiencing the power of those golden handcuffs.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:45.040]   If you have a compelling opportunity, if there's something that you knew you wanted to do or
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:49.760]   were clearly something that you should do, the decision would be easy. When I left Northwestern
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:54.680]   Mutual, I walked away from the vast majority of my retirement plans because I wasn't fully
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:35:00.520]   vested in them. I did that without – I mean I considered it, but I had something that
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:05.760]   was compelling to me and had a reason why the timing was important. I was watching the
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:12.400]   timing of what was happening in the marketplace. I was watching the timing of what was happening
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:16.960]   with podcasts. I wanted to have as much of an early mover advantage as possible and I
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.040]   knew I was already a year or so behind where I would have liked to have been and I said,
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:28.200]   "I'll get more benefit out of being a year early with this business than I will
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.800]   if I hang out and get this extra retirement money."
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.720]   For me, it was a relatively easy decision because I had something compelling to go to.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.360]   So practically speaking, what would my advice to you be? First, if you're moving to a
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.120]   new town and a new city and you don't have anything there, there's really not much
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:47.560]   reason for you to go there and sit on the couch and do nothing. If you're going to
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:53.280]   a – if you want to work in a similar industry, what I would do if I were in your shoes is
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:58.180]   I would do my best to try to arrange a transfer within the company that you're in. If there's
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:02.120]   a job position, once you're in a company, you know what the job positions are that are
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.480]   probably suitable for you or more suitable or less suitable.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:11.280]   But if you can arrange a transfer within that company, that will be helpful. Even if you
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:16.640]   earn less money because perhaps you transition to a different type of position, maybe it
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:21.760]   pays better, maybe it pays less. Even if you're earning money, just – I mean let's say
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.700]   you're earning median income, $4,000 a month but you're working in this new city
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:32.040]   for six months. Well, if you can line up $4,000 of income for six months, that's $24,000
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:40.600]   of gross earnings plus the $7,500. You've got a compelling reason to be working at that
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.600]   company.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.840]   Secondly, it's always easier to get a job when you're already well-employed than it
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.560]   is when you're unemployed. So if you can arrange to be employed while you're doing
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:56.160]   a job search, I think that's superior to your being unemployed. So I wouldn't burn
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:01.680]   the bridges unless there were some tremendous reason why you had to leave, ethical conflict,
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:06.280]   compelling issue, major problems. I wouldn't burn the bridges. I'd rather transfer within
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:13.840]   the company knowing that I've got a $7,500 in effect bonus coming and knowing that it
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.000]   will be easier for me to get a job when I'm working within the industry and I'm already
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.840]   settled in the industry than it will be for me to get a job if I'm unemployed.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:29.360]   Finally, practically speaking, it's just easier to set up life in a new town if you've
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.640]   got a job and it's going to be easier for you to arrange a job with the company you're
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:38.180]   with than it will be with a different company. I wouldn't let that keep me from looking
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:45.960]   for another opportunity with another company but I would allow it to motivate me to negotiate
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:52.480]   a little bit harder, to work a little bit harder and to try to negotiate a deal knowing
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:58.000]   that I'm going to walk away from $7,500 if I take this job. So raise your sights.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.840]   Try to get a better job, a fancier job, knowing that if you want to get an equal job with
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.400]   a different company, you can always do that but you need to get a better job and a fancier
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:12.080]   job in order for it to compensate for the $7,500 potential loss. So those are my thoughts,
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.080]   Julian.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:19.000]   Julian: Thank you so much, Joshua. That's extremely helpful and gives me definitely
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.120]   a lot to think about and I really like the way that you broke that down into a couple
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.400]   different things because it's not necessarily just about the money. It's also about what
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:31.520]   am I going to do when I get there and how am I going to find a better job. So I can't
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.640]   tell you how much I appreciate it. That was a great answer.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:36.800]   Josh Buettner: Good. I'm happy to help. We often think and it's hard. This is why
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.800]   we always have to talk things out. A multitude of counsel is wisdom and it's helpful to
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.480]   talk to people because other people who aren't facing the emotion of what we're facing
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:49.760]   often see opportunities. But there's no reason why every single person who is listening
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:56.480]   to this show can't concurrently with your current employment be working on something
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:00.080]   better. We should always be working on something better.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:05.360]   So we often see it as an either/or and that's what I'm encouraging is it's not. You can
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.680]   both work on something better and continue what you're doing at the same time. Of
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:13.760]   course, you can't give full priority to one or the other. You always have to adjust
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:18.640]   and vary how much energy and focus and effort do I have. But you can do both at the same
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.840]   time. So that'll be awesome. What town are you moving to?
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:25.040]   Josh Buettner: The home of your ex-employer, sir.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:33.680]   Ah, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I like Milwaukee. If you like midwestern towns, it's a nice
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.680]   city. It's awesome.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.680]   Josh Buettner: We're really excited for it. Thanks, Josh.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:40.680]   Cool. Let's see. I've got another caller here, Los Angeles phone number. Go ahead.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.680]   Hey, Josh. How are you doing?
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.680]   Well, sir, how are you?
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:54.680]   Good. Good. So I've got a question about my in-laws actually. So they have a small
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.680]   business. It's a motel business and they have a couple of employees that are family
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:04.680]   members. And then they have a couple of employees which are not family members. And
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:13.680]   they're both over 55. And so they don't have a 401k or retirement plan, an account
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:19.680]   or anything like that. And they have a high income right now for the last two years. So
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:26.680]   I'm thinking what are some good ways they can defer a good amount of money through
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:32.680]   the business, through like a SEP or an SEP IRA or a simple IRA?
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.680]   How many employees do they have?
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.680]   They have about 12.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:42.680]   Okay. And what is a high income? Do you have any idea of how much money they're
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.680]   actually earning?
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.680]   About a quarter of a million.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.680]   Okay. And do you have any idea what they're actually spending? Like is this a new
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.680]   thing for them? They're living on 50 and earning 250?
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:41:03.680]   So that's after, that would be after all the expenses. So that's the profit.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:09.680]   What do they intend to do with regard to retirement? Do they intend to retire? Is
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.680]   that important to them?
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:16.680]   Well, the business, the motel business is not going to be there for that many years.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:21.680]   So the owner is, they don't own the business, they lease the business and that
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.680]   property is getting converted into condos. And we don't know when that's going to
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:30.680]   happen, but I'm guessing two or three years later it's going to happen. So they're
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:34.680]   probably going to retire after that happens.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.680]   Do they have a lot of other savings and investments that aren't connected to this
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:42.680]   hotel business?
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.680]   They just have cash set aside.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.680]   And I know you may not know all the details, but I mean a lot of cash. Do they
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.680]   have millions of dollars of cash that they actually can retire or do they have
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.680]   $100,000 sitting in a checking account?
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.680]   Yeah, it's the latter.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:03.680]   Okay. So there's almost two questions in what you're asking. The first is simply
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:09.680]   is there an intelligent type of financial deferral account? That's the first
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.680]   question. That's the less important question. The bigger question is what are
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:19.680]   they going to do with their lives? But let's start with that first question with
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.680]   regard to retirement accounts.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:28.680]   If they don't currently have any retirement accounts in the business, which
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:33.680]   would not be unusual for a business like you described, a hotel business, 12
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.680]   employees, this is a small business. It's unusual for a business like this to have
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.680]   any type of group retirement account set up.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:46.680]   If they don't have something, they could establish, for example, a 401(k) plan.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:51.680]   They could establish some – depending on what type of business entity they're
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:56.680]   running, they could establish some kind of group plan. Let's just keep it simple
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:00.680]   and compare a 401(k) plan versus where a lot of people's minds go on a question
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.680]   like this, some sort of defined benefit plan.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:07.680]   A 401(k) plan would allow them to set aside some money and it would also allow
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.680]   their employees to set aside some money.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:16.680]   The challenge with a small business like this and the challenge with 401(k) plans
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:20.680]   in a business where you have an owner who's making a high income and you have
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.680]   the majority of the staff, which is probably not making a lot of income.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:28.680]   Several of the employees I would imagine are housekeepers, some basic front desk
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.680]   staff, et cetera. These are not highly compensated employees.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.680]   You have to meet all of the appropriate regulations for highly compensated
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.680]   employees and owners of businesses.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.680]   So that means that they need to match their employees' contributions.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.680]   They need to do a safe harbor plan, something along those lines.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:50.680]   Their employees probably don't have much of a value of that.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:55.680]   In this type of business, it's unusual that the employees highly value
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:59.680]   retirement accounts. That's very different than a white-collar engineering
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.680]   firm where people want the 401(k) accounts.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:05.680]   Oftentimes, business owners in this position struggle to get enough
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:09.680]   participation among their employees to meet the federally required
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.680]   participation ratios.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.680]   So I wouldn't guess that their employees are clamoring for it.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:20.680]   Also, within the context of their overall financial plan, for them just to put
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.680]   aside some money in a 401(k) plan for two years, that's not going to make a
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:27.680]   meaningful impact on their ability to retire.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:33.680]   If they are, you said they're 60 years old? How old are they?
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.680]   Yeah, they're 60 years old.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:40.680]   Okay, 60 years old. So if they're 60 years old and if they've got $100,000
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.680]   in the bank, maybe they own a house with a hundred or a couple hundred
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.680]   thousand dollars of equity and then they have this business, if somehow
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:51.680]   magically we were able to fast forward a couple years and they open a 401(k)
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.680]   plan for themselves and they defer into the 401(k) plan, let's just say
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:00.680]   $100,000 each and they – over the course of a couple years and they're
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.680]   able to have an account with a couple hundred thousand dollars in it, this is
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.680]   not going to allow them to retire.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:10.680]   They can't retire at 62 years old with $200,000 in a 401(k) plan.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.680]   So practically, it's impractical.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:19.680]   It's not going to adjust their financial situation very significantly.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.680]   It's not going to allow them to retire.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.680]   Their employees probably aren't going to participate.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.680]   They're probably not going to meet the participation ratios such to allow
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:31.680]   them to not have to do a safe harbor plan or something like that.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.680]   It's not going to work.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:37.680]   Now, the next employee option, when you have a business where you are going
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.680]   to have – where you have highly compensated employees and less highly
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:44.680]   compensated employees, where you have a big diversity and also when you
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:48.680]   have a business where the business owners are older but some of the
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:52.680]   employees are much younger, then you want to look to see if doing a
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.680]   defined benefit plan would be an intelligent option.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.680]   Where financial planners usually look out for these is the best example is
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:05.680]   you look for a doctor who has a very high income and they have one older
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:11.680]   doctor, two older doctors in the company and then maybe a couple of nurses
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:16.680]   and receptionists who are earning less money, substantially less money.
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.680]   Then perhaps there's an opportunity there where they can set up a defined
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.680]   benefit plan.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:24.680]   The idea behind a defined benefit plan is instead of deferring a certain
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:28.680]   amount of the doctor's compensation based upon the contribution like a
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.680]   401(k) plan, which is called a defined contribution plan, instead of just
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.680]   deferring $50,000, the way a defined benefit plan works is you can calculate
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:42.680]   out the total annual retirement income that you're trying to solve for.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:47.680]   Let's say you're trying to solve for an annual retirement income of $75,000.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.680]   Now the business needs to fund the plan sufficient to the level where
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:57.680]   actuarially it can deliver that retirement benefit for the retiring physician.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:03.680]   So this type of plan is very attractive if you have an older, higher income
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:09.680]   earner as a key figure in the business and you have younger, less compensated
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.680]   staff.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.680]   The reason it's attractive is because the business will have to set aside
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:17.680]   enough money to fund a benefit for all of the employees.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:22.680]   But the older, highly compensated business owner is going to get
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.680]   proportionately a much higher benefit because it's going to be based upon
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.680]   the salary.
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.680]   So this is the way we're in the scenario I mentioned.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.680]   Like I said, financial planners, we look for doctors who are old and rich
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:36.680]   and have a young, lightly paid staff.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:40.680]   This is where – why do I allow the business to set aside hundreds of
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.680]   thousands of dollars per year, all of which is deductible?
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:47.680]   Well, that type of situation doesn't apply here with this scenario of
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.680]   outline for me either simply because they're going to be forced out of the
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:51.680]   business.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.680]   The defined benefit plan, it's very important when setting up one of these
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:58.680]   for a business that the business needs to be confident that its future earnings
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.680]   are stable because these plans need to be funded for enough time and they need
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.680]   to be stable.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:07.680]   Depending on the nature of the business, you can sometimes choose a business
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:12.680]   that's steady or that's – where the contribution is steady and flat or it's
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.680]   adjust but it needs to be stable.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.680]   So if they know the business is going to be closing in a couple of years and
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.680]   this is just – this is not going to work.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.680]   It's just too much of a hassle to set it up.
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.680]   They don't have enough money practically to fund it anyway in what you
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.680]   described to me and it's just not going to work.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:30.680]   So that was the long-winded financial planner way to say I wouldn't bother
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.680]   with setting up any kind of retirement plan in what you described here.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:39.680]   What I would do in their situation is I would start with that second question
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:40.680]   which is more important.
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.680]   I would say, "What are they going to do with their lives?"
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:48.680]   because they're not going to sit around – number one, in what you described to
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.680]   me, they don't have enough money to retire.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:54.680]   So this idea that they're going to somehow turn 63, take social security and
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.680]   say – are they going to live on $2,000 a month?
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:02.680]   They need to figure out what's the business and adventure that they're going to
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.680]   start on for the rest of their life.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:09.680]   What I would do is I would take the next two years of profit from this business
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:13.680]   and I would – knowing that it's going to be closing under the circumstances
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:17.680]   you said and I would invest that profit into setting up the next business.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.680]   I would encourage them to consider some sort of lifestyle business that will
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.680]   meet their needs.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:28.680]   So is that lifestyle business to establish a bed and breakfast in the
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.680]   Shenandoah Valley?
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.680]   I don't know.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:35.680]   Is that lifestyle business to purchase some houses that they're going to put
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:40.680]   out on Airbnb in a desirable market of real estate?
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.680]   Do they want to – what do they want to do?
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:46.680]   They're going to need to earn income out of it because they don't have enough
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:48.680]   money to retire.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:52.680]   So how could they take some of those profits and invest them into that next
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:57.680]   business and make these higher years of earnings the time in which they're
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.680]   making these investments into the next business?
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:03.680]   Now, whether that's within their current business entity or that's in the
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:07.680]   context of a separate business entity or whether that's in the context of
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:12.680]   investment activities, that's beyond the scope of your knowledge of their
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:13.680]   finances.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.680]   That's between them and their financial advice team.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:20.680]   But conceptually, that's their best opportunity to save taxes is to take these
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:24.680]   next two years of high income and invest it into setting up the next business
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.680]   which is actually going to fund their retirement lifestyle.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.680]   That's my answer.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:30.680]   Follow-up questions?
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:31.680]   Is that helpful?
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.680]   Yes, that's very helpful.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:39.680]   Now, when you say the best way to defer the taxes currently would be investing
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.680]   in another business.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:45.680]   Now, what sort of structure would that be?
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.680]   If they don't know what that business is, would it be like opening up another
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:54.680]   corporation and then just putting money there or was that just more of a general
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:56.680]   idea?
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.680]   Well, it would depend on the specifics of their situation.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:01.680]   So I'm just talking about in general an idea.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:06.680]   But simply speaking, they own – they are operating a hotel using a leased
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.680]   facility.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.680]   Well, if they like the hotel business, then why don't they go find another
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.680]   hotel?
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:17.680]   And so if they have one location – and where is this hotel located that they're
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.680]   operating?
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.680]   In Los Angeles.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:21.680]   OK, in Los Angeles.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.680]   And do they want to stay in Los Angeles?
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.680]   Yes.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.680]   OK.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.680]   So they need to go find another hotel in Los Angeles.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:32.680]   And so what I mean is there – that if it takes them time away from the
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:38.680]   business to go find the hotel, if it takes them hiring a consultant to help
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:44.680]   them find the hotel, if they need to go and negotiate a deal on a building to
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:49.680]   buy a building, if they need to go and find some unbuilt out land to build it,
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:53.680]   if they need to go and find a new lease and they need to put a – make a
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:57.680]   purchase – set up a lease option and make an option payment on a building
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:03.680]   that they find, these are all reliable ways of them investing money into the
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.680]   business.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:08.680]   And what this has the net effect of doing is it lowers their profit in the
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:13.680]   current year, which lowers their tax burden, and it shifts – this is a – it
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.680]   moves the timing forward.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:16.680]   This is a timing strategy.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:21.680]   So they're making an expenditure and deferring a deduction to the future,
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:25.680]   cutting down on their tax bill now so that they can set that next business up.
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:30.680]   So every business grows and expands itself by investing back into it.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:34.680]   And so yes, this does have the net effect of lowering the tax bill, but it's
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:35.680]   not a game.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:36.680]   It's not a shell game.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.680]   It's just simply that it's a way of thinking that I'm going to invest and
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.680]   to expand the business.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:46.680]   And the biggest thing is for them to build a compelling vision of what their
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.680]   next business and career is going to be and then go make that happen.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:53.680]   But there's no – in the circumstances you described to me, I don't see any
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:57.680]   easy wins from a tax perspective with regard to retirement plans.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:02.680]   Specifically, I see a big win for them to recognize they're not going to retire.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.680]   Now go and build the business they want to own for the next 20, 30 years.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.680]   Sure.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:09.680]   That makes sense.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:10.680]   Cool.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:11.680]   Got a few minutes left.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.680]   I think I've taken all the questions from the callers on the line.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:17.680]   Anyone – would anybody like to step in and ask another question or ask a
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:21.680]   follow-up question who's on the line right now?
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.680]   Joshua, this is Joe.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.680]   Hey, Joe.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.680]   Go ahead.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.680]   Yeah, I just wanted to let you know I've been Googling furiously for the past
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:35.680]   25 minutes and it looks like using the 457(b) to dodge the 10% early withdrawal
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.680]   penalty is not a valid strategy.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:43.680]   According to an IRS publication I found, it appears that the 457 plan will track
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:49.680]   them out from a qualified retirement plan and they're subject to the 10%.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.680]   That's what we need to know.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:53.680]   If you found an IRS publication saying that, I wouldn't risk it.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.680]   There are enough other things that you could do.
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:01.680]   I wouldn't risk that and I'm glad you found that.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.680]   I could go with the Roth ladder.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.680]   This sounded too good to be true.
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.680]   It is.
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:11.680]   I've never heard of that strategy of moving the – the 457 for those listeners
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.680]   who aren't familiar because I didn't clarify it earlier.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:21.680]   457 accounts can be tremendously valuable for early retirement because they can
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:24.680]   be tax-deferred accounts that are open to government employees, usually
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:29.680]   nonprofit employees, but they don't have the 59.5 restriction on them.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:36.680]   So a police officer can heavily fund a 457 plan and they can retire, pull money
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:40.680]   from the 457 plan just like they would if it were an IRA, but they don't have
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:42.680]   to wait until 59.5.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.680]   That can be a valuable bridge account for example if they're going to have a
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:49.680]   pension distribution at a certain age and they fund the bridge, the gap between
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:53.680]   when they retire and when they start receiving their pension payments.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:57.680]   There can be a lot of options and usefulness with it.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:01.680]   But Joe, I had never heard of somebody using it for early retirement and I read
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:05.680]   enough and I pay attention to it that I figure if it were a useful strategy,
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:06.680]   I probably would have heard of it.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:07.680]   I'm not infallible.
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:12.680]   A few weeks ago, I did that show on just simply taking profits out of a 401(k)
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:16.680]   and having that still be superior to using a taxable account even if you're
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.680]   paying the penalty and I learned something completely new.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.680]   But yeah, I had not heard of somebody using this strategy.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.680]   So if you found the IRS publication, that's what we need.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.680]   Maybe, Joe, after this show goes out on the website, maybe you can link to that
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:31.680]   publication and if any other listeners have comments or contributions on this
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:35.680]   subject, chat about it in the blog post for today's show.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.680]   Any other follow-up questions, comments before I hit the music?
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:42.680]   Cool.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.680]   Thank you all so much for calling in to these shows.
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.680]   I enjoy doing these Q&A shows.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.680]   I hope that you, the listening audience, have learned something.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.680]   I love doing this.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:55.680]   It's so useful to hear other people's questions because then you can turn and
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:01.680]   hopefully look at your own situation and apply a little bit of creative thinking
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.680]   to your own situation.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:08.680]   My encouragement to you is consider what you can do with your money in your
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.680]   situation and your context.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:16.680]   Notice there was not a specific theme that rolled through this but the theme in
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:20.680]   today's show that I picked up on was invest the money into things that you know.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:24.680]   So if you know how to operate a hotel and that's something where you have skills,
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:27.680]   well, you can take that skill and you can transition it to a new business.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:31.680]   Now, it might be better for you to go and just get a job as a general manager of
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.680]   a hotel for someone else.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:38.680]   I mean $250,000 of profit is -- it's not insubstantial but you could probably get
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.680]   a nice six-figure job working for a major hotel chain or you could take that
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:45.680]   skill and if you wanted to go and open a bed and breakfast in a rural county
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:48.680]   somewhere, you could go and do that as well.
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:51.680]   Even in the first caller, Eric, when he was talking about how do I invest the
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:56.680]   money, you look to see can I invest the money in myself, in my business, and then
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.680]   is there something where I have a skill and interest and ability to invest it
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:00.680]   locally.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:04.680]   I talk about flipping lawnmowers because I see that.
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:08.680]   I know a couple of friends of mine who make a lot of money flipping lawnmowers
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:09.680]   on Craigslist.
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.680]   They live a great lifestyle.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.680]   Now, what that is for you, you'll have to figure out.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:16.680]   But take the concept and apply it.
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   It applies to flipping lawnmowers on Craigslist and it applies to flipping
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:22.680]   billion-dollar businesses.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.680]   Same concept.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:25.680]   So thank you all so much for listening.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:26.680]   Thank you for calling in.
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:31.680]   If you would like to call into a show like this, frankly, this is your best way.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.680]   Presently at the moment, you can see I think we have five or six callers on
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.680]   today's show.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:36.680]   This is your best way to get a direct response from me.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:37.680]   I get dozens of emails.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:40.680]   It's very difficult for me to respond to emails consistently.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.680]   I put them aside in the queue for future shows.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.680]   But this is always going to be your best bet.
