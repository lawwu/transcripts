[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   Adam Schiff yesterday proposed a bill called the Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.480]   in response to, I think, over 100 musicians signing a letter saying they're concerned
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.040]   that their copyrighted works are being used to train AI models.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.480]   Look, I think there's three potential outcomes here.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.760]   Outcome number one is that the courts decide that this is fair use and these AI companies
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.720]   aren't in violation of rights.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.880]   Outcome number two is that the courts throw a big wrench into it or a bill like Schiff's
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.480]   bill throws a big wrench into it.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.440]   I think what happens then is new AI companies have a really hard time accumulating training
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.440]   data.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.760]   Now you've created a real moat and barrier to entry, and it's going to be a big problem,
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.240]   I think, for the open source movement.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.720]   Outcome number three is you create some sort of rights clearinghouse, kind of like exists
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.400]   in the recording industry.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.400]   That would be the compromise, in which case the incumbents probably like that because,
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.000]   again, they want there to be a barrier to entry.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.920]   I don't know which one of the three it's going to be, but those are the three potential outcomes
