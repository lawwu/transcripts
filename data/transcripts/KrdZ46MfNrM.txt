[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   >>LT: Let alone consciousness.
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.560]   >>JB: Oh, let alone consciousness, yes, yes.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.800]   >>LT: Because that's tied up in there too. You can't just put that on another shelf.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.600]   >>JB: Every once in a while I get interested in consciousness, and then I go and I've done
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:27.120]   that for years, and ask one of my bettors, as it were, their view on consciousness. It's
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.560]   been interesting collecting them.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.600]   >>LT: What is consciousness? Let's try to take a brief step into that room.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.400]   >>JB: Well, I asked Marvin Minsky, did you go into consciousness? And Marvin said,
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:51.280]   "Consciousness is basically overrated. It may be an epiphenomenon. After all,
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.280]   all the things your brain does, which are actually hard computations, you do non-consciously.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.280]   And there's so much evidence that even the simple things you do,
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.200]   you can make committed decisions about them. The neurobiologist can say,
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.360]   "He's now committed. He's going to move the hand left before you know it."
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.200]   >>LT: So, his view that consciousness is not, that's just like little icing on the cake.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.960]   The real cake is in the subconscious.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.720]   >>JB: Yeah, yeah. Subconscious, non-conscious.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.480]   >>LT: Non-conscious, what's the better word, sir?
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.360]   >>JB: It's only that Freud captured the other word.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.640]   >>LT: Yeah, it's a confusing word, subconscious.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.080]   >>JB: Nicholas Chater wrote an interesting book, I think the title of it is "The Mind is Flat."
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:02:01.200]   And flat in a neural net sense, might be flat is something which is a very broad neural net
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   without really any layers in depth, or the deep brain would be many layers and not so broad.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.720]   In the same sense that if you push Minsky hard enough, he would probably have said,
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.080]   "Consciousness is your effort to explain to yourself that which you have already done."
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:30.240]   >>LT: Yeah, it's the weaving of the narrative around the things that have already been computed
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.560]   for you.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.400]   >>JB: That's right. And so much of what we do for our memories of events, for example,
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.400]   if there's some traumatic event you witness, you will have a few facts about it correctly done.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.960]   If somebody asks you about it, you will weave a narrative which is actually much more rich
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:00.400]   in detail than that, based on some anchor points you have of correct things, and pulling together
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.160]   general knowledge on the other, but you will have a narrative. And once you generate that narrative,
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.800]   you are very likely to repeat that narrative and claim that all the things you have in it
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.120]   are actually the correct things. There was a marvelous example of that in the
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:26.960]   Watergate/impeachment era of John Dean. John Dean, you're too young to know,
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:36.960]   had been the personal lawyer of Nixon. And so John Dean was involved in the cover-up, and
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.440]   John Dean ultimately realized the only way to keep himself out of jail for a long time
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.960]   was actually to tell some of the truths about Nixon. And John Dean was a tremendous witness.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.840]   He would remember these conversations in great detail, and very convincing detail.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.800]   And long afterward, some of the tapes, the secret tapes as it were, from which
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:12.720]   Gene was recalling these conversations, were published. And one found out that John Dean had
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.480]   a good but not exceptional memory. What he had was an ability to paint vividly,
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.800]   and in some sense accurately, the tone of what was going on.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.360]   By the way, that's a beautiful description of consciousness.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:38.960]   Do you, like where do you stand in your, today?
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.600]   So perhaps this changes day to day, but where do you stand on the importance of consciousness
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.560]   in our whole big mess of cognition? Is it just a little narrative maker,
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.480]   or is it actually fundamental to intelligence?
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:06.400]   That's a very hard one. When I asked Francis Crick about consciousness,
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.720]   he launched forward in a long monologue about Mendel and the peas.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.040]   And how Mendel knew that there was something, and how biologists understood that there was
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:27.040]   something in inheritance, which was just very, very different. And the fact that inherited
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:34.400]   traits didn't just wash out into a gray, but were this or this, and propagated.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:42.240]   That was absolutely fundamental to biology. And it took generations of biologists to understand
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.920]   that there was genetics, and it took another generation or two to understand that genetics
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:54.080]   came from DNA. But very shortly after Mendel,
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.560]   thinking biologists did realize that there was a deep problem about inheritance.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:08.720]   And Francis would have liked to have said, "And that's why I'm working on consciousness."
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.040]   But of course, he didn't have any smoking gun in the sense of Mendel.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:23.200]   And that's the weakness of his position. If you read his book, which he wrote with Koch,
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.000]   I think.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.120]   Yeah, Christoph Koch, yeah.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.320]   I find it unconvincing for the smoking gun reason.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.840]   So I've gone on collecting views without actually having taken a very strong one myself,
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.560]   because I haven't seen the entry point. Not seeing the smoking gun
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.000]   from the point of view of physics, I don't see the entry point.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.920]   Whereas in neurobiology, once I understood the idea of a collective evolution of dynamics,
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:02.560]   which could be described as a collective phenomenon, I thought, "Ah, there's a point
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.600]   where what I know about physics is so different from any neurobiologist that I have something
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.960]   that I might be able to contribute."
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:15.520]   And right now, there's no way to grasp at consciousness from a physics perspective.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.160]   From my point of view, that's correct. And of course, people,
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.640]   physicists like everybody else, think very muddily about things. You ask
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.040]   the closely related question about free will. Do you believe you have free will?
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:40.400]   Physicists will give an offhand answer, and then backtrack, backtrack, backtrack,
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.200]   where they realize that the answer they gave must fundamentally contradict the laws of physics.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.640]   Naturally, answering questions of free will and consciousness naturally lead to contradictions
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.720]   from a physics perspective, because it eventually ends up with quantum mechanics, and then you
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:03.840]   get into that whole mess of trying to understand how much, from a physics perspective,
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:10.160]   how much is determined, already predetermined, how much is already deterministic about our universe.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.360]   There's lots of different—
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.240]   And if you don't push quite that far, you can say,
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:21.360]   essentially all of neurobiology, which is relevant, can be captured by classical equations of motion.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.440]   Because in my view of the mysteries of the brain are not the mysteries of quantum mechanics,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.320]   but the mysteries of what can happen when you have a dynamical system,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:42.560]   driven system, with 10 to the 14 parts. That that complexity is something which is—
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:49.360]   that the physics of complex systems is at least as badly understood
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.360]   as the physics of phase coherence in quantum mechanics.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:53.760]   Thanks.
