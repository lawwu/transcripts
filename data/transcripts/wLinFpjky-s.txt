[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   what's not maintenance work? I think that's a really important question.
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.160]   What is not maintenance? So in life, maintenance is cleaning your car,
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.440]   is maintenance. Doing your bed is maintenance. Cooking food is maintenance,
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.160]   right? To maintain your thing. What I think is not maintenance is building
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.720]   relationships, building family, right? Because if I invest today in my wife or
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.880]   my husband or whatever, in the future, it results in a nice family. So I don't
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.760]   view that as maintenance. I view that as building for the future, building a

[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.840]   and physique. I think those are the four things I've identified as non
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.360]   maintenance things, and I'm happy to invest in them. I invest a lot. So because
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.800]   I'm single now, unfortunately, I invest a lot of my time into fitness and
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.520]   building my business. I have two companies, so I'm building there. So
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.120]   that's the only thing I view as non maintenance work. Everything else is
