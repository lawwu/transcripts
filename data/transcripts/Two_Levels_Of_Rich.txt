[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from Financial Samurai. And in this episode, I want to talk about the two
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.720]   levels of rich, one level of which doesn't rely on index funds at all. So it's safe to assume the
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.000]   vast majority of you reading Financial Samurai want to be rich. I trust those of you who've
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.880]   been reading the site since 2009, and maybe since 2012, when I was writing heavily about investment
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.040]   strategies have indeed become much richer. The compounding forces since then have been enormous,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   right? We've been in a huge bull market since 2009. We're probably one of the richest communities on
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.800]   the internet today, based on all the surveys I've conducted since then. There's been over 100
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:51.440]   surveys. For example, 35% of you have a net worth of between $300,000 to $1 million, while 25% of
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.600]   you have a net worth of over $1 million. That's really, really solid compared to the median and
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.080]   average net worths in America today, which are all 50, 60, 70, 80% lower, depending on which metric
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.480]   you use. But here's the thing, despite our good fortune, it's worth discussing the two levels of
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.040]   rich. Because since I started this site, it's clear one level of rich has far surpassed the
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.360]   other level of rich. And that one level of rich didn't do so by investing in index funds over the
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.640]   past 10, 20, 30 years. I know we all love index funds. I love index funds. They're the personal
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.280]   finance communities number one recommendation for where to invest our money in stocks at least,
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.640]   right? VTSAX, VTI, SPY, index funds and ETFs are the way to go. It's very hard to outperform
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.280]   any index fund or ETF over a five to 10 year period. Retail investors have failed, most of
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.960]   us have failed. Professional money managers, most of them have failed something to the tune of 80%
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.280]   of underperformed over a 10 year period. And that cost that cost is a real drag that really adds up
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.360]   over time and also front loading commissions man paying a two to 5% front load fee. That's,
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.560]   that's crazy, folks. Don't do that because you're right, way behind it from the starting gate.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.200]   Alright, so now that we've talked about some of the positives of index funds and ETFs,
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.360]   let's look at the other side of the coin. If you want to achieve financial independence
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:32.000]   well before the traditional age of 65 or 60, investing only in index funds is probably not
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.240]   going to cut it. The only way to get rich sooner off index funds is to consistently invest large
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.800]   sums of money. But that's kind of like saying to get richer, you got to start with a lot of money.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.120]   So that kind of defeats the purpose. The reality is there's a whole other level of rich that has
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.320]   little to do with investing in index funds. As one centi millionaire once told me, quote,
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.680]   investing in index funds is what middle class people do who don't know what to do, end quote.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.480]   Ouch, a dagger to my heart. But is there some truth to what he has said? I think there is.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.720]   And part of the reason why there's so much discussion about index funds in the personal
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.880]   finance community is because a lot of people who talk and write about money and investing
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.680]   actually don't come from investing backgrounds. Just think about the people who you read and
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.680]   listen to. Did they work in finance or did they make money through investing or most of their
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.840]   wealth? Probably not. I mean, let's just be honest, probably not. And so the easiest default
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.840]   assumption is to say, let's just invest in index funds. Let's pay down debt. Let's save more money.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.480]   So pretty much the basic common stuff, which is great and fine. And a lot of people don't do it.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.240]   But I think this is part of the reason why investing in index funds is so prevalent,
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.120]   because it's the easy thing to do and talk about. It's easy to understand. And when things are easy
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.000]   to understand, it's more easily spreadable. So listen, investing in an S&P 500 index fund or ETF
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.960]   is my default setting when I'm buying the dip, but don't have strong conviction on a particular stock
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.200]   or frankly, the market overall. I understand the downside of investing in an S&P 500 index fund or
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:26.320]   ETF. You should too. Basically, a bear market lasts about a year on average and has about a 35%
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.680]   drawdown. And I'm fine with that. And if you invest in an S&P 500 index fund, you should be
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.640]   fine with that and aware of that possibility as well. There are no risk-free investments when
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.160]   you're investing in stocks. And I also view investing in an index fund like investing in a
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.640]   super tanker. It doesn't move very fast at historically a 10% annual return, which probably
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.960]   is going to go down in the foreseeable future or at least over the next five to 10 years.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.960]   But the super tanker doesn't easily veer off course or sink to the bottom of the ocean either.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.040]   Sooner or later, the super tank will get to its destination. And that's really important for all
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.560]   of us. If the direction is correct, sooner or later, we'll get there. But if you are a proponent
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:18.000]   of fire, retiring earlier, or just hopping off the corporate train before the age of 60, 65,
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.520]   index funds is just like a tailwind. And they're going to provide you a tailwind to get to where
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.600]   you want to go. But it's hard to get there sooner. So let's just talk about the two levels of rich.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.920]   The first level rich I'll call the mass affluent class. The mass affluent class is highly educated,
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.280]   motivated, and upwardly mobile. Upwardly mobile is really important because if you believe you
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.760]   can make progress, that gives you hope. And when you have hope, you have action and you can take
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.000]   action to improve your situation. The mass affluent class is considered rich by general standards,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.040]   but often doesn't feel rich. I think today the mass affluent class has investable assets of between
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.280]   $500,000 to $3 million. The mass affluent class also has a net worth of between $500,000 to $5
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.800]   million. And it largely depends on age, location, and household. Obviously, if you're younger,
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.360]   and if you live in a lower cost area of the country, you know, the mass affluent class
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.280]   determined by these figures is probably on the lower end. And then as you get older,
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:28.720]   the net worth and income figures go higher. So the mass affluent class loves investing in stock
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.760]   index funds and in real estate. They've got good jobs, often with six-figure household incomes,
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.000]   usually less than 20% of their investable assets are in alternative investments,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.880]   including cryptocurrencies. And for the most part, the mass affluent class is a great
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:49.760]   place to be great. You're comfortable and you always have hope for a wealthier future. And
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.920]   frankly, by the numbers, most financial samurai listeners and readers are part of the mass
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.920]   affluent class, or will be a part of the mass affluent class. Now let's talk about the second
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:09.040]   level of rich. I'll just call them the truly rich. The truly rich are what people think about when
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:15.920]   they hear the word rich. We're talking vacation homes in the Hamptons, in Napa Valley, first class
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:23.760]   flights, maybe private class on occasion, $100,000 plus automobiles, and generous donations to charity
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.920]   where your name actually appears on a wall. The truly rich have investable assets of at least
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:37.200]   five to 10 million. This is liquid assets and a net worth of at least 10 to 25 million,
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.400]   depending again on location, age, and household. These are the minimum levels here. And in a bull
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.800]   market, the truly rich crush it with multi-million dollar gains a year. As a result, they think to
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.360]   themselves, why bother working so hard when you're making so much more from your investments?
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.360]   Conversely, in a bear market, the truly rich get beat up the most, right? Back in 2009,
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:05.120]   we were all relatively much wealthier, not because we made more money, but because people
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:11.280]   like Warren Buffett lost tens of billions of dollars in individual wealth. And if you look
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:19.680]   at the net worth composition of the truly rich, index funds account for a minority, minority share.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.440]   Instead, the truly rich have the majority of their net worth in their business and other business
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:31.360]   ventures. So equity in their own business or other business ventures. And in terms of wealth creation,
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:40.080]   the top 0.1% and top 0.01% have trounced those in the top 1%, nevermind the top 10%.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:47.040]   So when you hear headlines like, you know, millionaires are annoyed with the billionaires
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.880]   that sent to millionaires, it's that kind of angst and common comparison. Everything's all
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.520]   relative in finance. So even if you're worth 10 million, you're going to feel a little disgruntled
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.960]   if somebody moves in next door who's worth 50 million and has a whole bunch of fun things
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:08.320]   outside on his or her driveway. So let's break down a little bit more in detail the net worth
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:15.440]   of the mass affluent and the truly rich. So roughly 25% of the mass affluence net worth is in their
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:22.640]   primary residence. 15% is in retirement accounts, 10% is in real estate investments, and 12%
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:29.600]   is in business interests. In comparison for the truly rich, at least 30% of their net worth is in
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.880]   business interests. Intuitively, we know that entrepreneurs dominate the wealthiest people in
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:41.200]   the world. Therefore, if you want to be truly rich, take more entrepreneurial risk. I'm looking at
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:48.160]   this chart, let's say for those with over 100 million in net worth, their business interests
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:55.760]   account for about 50% of their entire net worth. Real estate, it's about 15%. Fixed income,
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:09.040]   decent about 18%. Stocks about 18 to 20%. Mutual funds, about 20%. Over the past, let's say 10
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:16.960]   years, I have seen regular millionaires become extraordinarily wealthy. And it's really due to
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:24.000]   the businesses that they've built and the risks that they've taken. So maybe 10 years ago, it would
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.680]   seem uncommon to meet people worth 25 to $50 million or $100 million, or maybe ever bump into
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.520]   a billionaire at like a dinner or a restaurant or cocktail party or whatnot. But now, and I don't
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.480]   know if it's just because of function of me living in San Francisco, but I bump into these folks
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.920]   on a regular basis now, whether it's on the tennis courts or in a public park. And it's also because
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:54.400]   I'm older, right? I'm 45 now versus 34, 32, when I first started writing. And so the people that I
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:00.560]   know have gotten wealthier over time. And that's just the power of compound returns. I was playing
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:07.600]   tennis with an old friend on the public courts one day. And he said his cousin, he's 52 years old,
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:14.240]   he works at PG&E, which is a utility company. He probably makes, I don't know, around $160,000 a
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:21.120]   year, not huge, but he's staying on until he's 55 for a pension. But here's the one thing, he's worth
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:28.400]   about $40 million. And I asked my friend, why the hell is he still working when he's worth $40
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:34.640]   million at age 52? It's not like working at PG&E is really exciting. And he just says, you know,
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:41.920]   he just wants that pension. And I asked him how did he manage to earn $40 million or get a net
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.480]   worth of $40 million. And he said, through cryptocurrencies, he's been buying all different
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.000]   types of cryptocurrencies. His net worth probably went up to 60, 70 million. And now it's quote,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.520]   only 40 million. But he doesn't have to work, but he still works anyways. So these are like
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:03.600]   the common middle class millionaires that I see more and more of. This is just an example.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.560]   And given I'm in the personal finance world, you might be listening and reading to other
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:15.520]   personal finance sites and podcasts as well. And you might, you might think that this is the entire
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:22.640]   world. Okay, index funds and you know, retire with $3 million by 50, 60 years old, and then live
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:28.640]   happily ever after. And that's fine. That's totally fine. But I'm telling you that there's this whole
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:34.480]   world, different world out there of rich that have gone way beyond that. And so when you start
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:41.120]   believing and knowing what is possible, that will help you build more wealth if that's what you want.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.920]   One of the reasons why I wrote my upcoming book, Buy This, Not That, How to Spend Your Way to
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:51.440]   Wealth and Freedom is due to the urgent need for better financial education for the general public.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.600]   I spent 13 years working in finance, I got my MBA, and I'm a practitioner of investing, saving,
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:05.200]   retiring early and going through everything so I can tell you what it's like. Those who are
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:11.280]   financially savvy have crushed it over the past decade. And because of the stealth wealth mantra,
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:16.240]   a lot of folks don't really understand how much these folks have crushed it. Meanwhile,
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.920]   those who are disinterested in personal finances and investing and who haven't spent much time
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:28.080]   at all learning about investing have fallen farther and farther behind. And as a financial
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:34.480]   writer, it feels bad the wealth gap has widened so significantly, because it feels like I'm
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.760]   failing a large part of the population. I know I can't save anyone and there's no savior complex.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:46.240]   But this is what I do. This is what I've been doing for so long since 2009. And I want people
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:51.680]   to achieve financial freedom sooner so they can do more of what they want. In conclusion,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:59.760]   I say index funds are great for the majority of your public stock portfolio. I recommend 70% 80%
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:06.080]   plus of your public stock equity portfolio be an index funds and the rest 20 to 30% you can buy
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:12.160]   individual stocks, companies that you like the products that you use. I've been doing this for
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:18.400]   20 plus years. And I've accumulated names such as Apple have an iPhone, I have a MacBook,
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:25.200]   Nike stock, because I'm infatuated with old Air Jordans and Andre Agassiz. Those shoes I was
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.720]   growing up with as a kid that I couldn't afford a single pair. And then what Google I use Google
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.600]   all the time. Yeah, Google, you know, these names, they're probably going to do okay, but there are
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:41.760]   no guarantees. And I'm under no delusion that I will be able to outperform the broader index.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:48.000]   But this is my strategy. It's the stock plus strategy. And then I've taken concentrated bets
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.240]   in real estate, specifically San Francisco real estate since 2003. And Heartland and Sunbelt real
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:01.680]   estate since 2016. It's about 50% of my net worth, because I like real estate, it's tangible,
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.480]   it produces income, it provides shelter. And it's not just going to go poof overnight,
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:12.720]   like some growth stocks have done over the past 12 months. Real estate really is the asset class
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.920]   that I like the most because it tends to generate the most amount of tax efficient income. So you
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.640]   if you're planning on jumping off the corporate bandwagon, it's really the real estate income that
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   has provided me the most amount of income to live our lives. In comparison, index funds, yeah,
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:36.480]   they generate about 1.5 to 1.8% in dividends. And if you buy dividend stocks, it'll generate
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:41.280]   probably they'll probably generate more. However, I'm mostly investing in growth stocks, and then I
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:47.680]   have index funds. So it's not a huge portion of my passive investment income. And finally,
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:53.040]   business interests. Since 2009, I've been spending time creating Financial Samurai,
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.800]   which does have value and it generates online income. So one of the big differences between
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:04.160]   a day job and having your own business is that you have the double banger of owning the equity
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:10.400]   and owning the income. So if you work at a company, you'll probably get mostly compensation
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.120]   in terms of your salary, and then maybe some equity compensation, obviously more if you join
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:21.200]   a startup or a tech company, and less if you join other types of industries. I hope you all enjoyed
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   this episode. It really is important to open people's eyes to what's possible. And I do believe
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.680]   you're going to really enjoy by this not that how to spend your way to wealth and freedom. You can
