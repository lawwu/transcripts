[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.220]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about the quiet quitting phenomenon
[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.600]   It's all over the news
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.280]   It's all over social media
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.980]   The idea behind quiet quitting is to do no more than what's asked of you at work and then check out
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.900]   Once you're out of the office, there's no more responding to work emails slack
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.940]   Nothing a quiet quitter does not go above and beyond the call of duty. That sounds kind of bad
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.300]   But is it really you work 100% for 100% pay seems pretty fair to me
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.360]   so these quiet quitters have been able to create a strong boundary between work and
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.760]   personal life over the past two and a half years since the beginning of 2020 a
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.080]   Lot of the work and personal life boundaries have blurred because we're working from home
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.480]   Which means we're probably working more often. No commute do some work
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.080]   No, you know boondoggling at the water cooler do some more work check emails at 9 p.m. 10 p.m
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.040]   That's all work
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.560]   and so eventually after a long enough period of time we burn out and when we burn out we push back and we try to
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.520]   Think about better ways to do things now initially when I heard the term quiet quitting I thought to myself come on now
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.240]   That's just that's just another
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.360]   younger generation talking about wanting to do less and living a better balanced lifestyle and
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.680]   Since I grinded hard when I was in my 20s and 30s that just sounds ridiculous to be a quiet quitter, right?
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.160]   But now that I'm a parent
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:44.240]   I'm kind of going full circle and I'm thinking about my children and how they're gonna compete in this really really competitive world
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.920]   So I've decided to take the positive of quiet quitting and look at the positive and say look
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.200]   Quiet quitting is great to lower your anxiety
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.000]   about your own work
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.640]   Trying to get ahead and also if you're a parent to help lower your anxiety for your child's future
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.880]   So let me tell you a story about when I was growing up when I started working in finance in 1999
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.560]   I regularly worked between 60 to 70 hours a week
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.520]   It was basically 12 to 14 hour days and also 6 to 8 hours on the weekends
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.480]   There were no set hours folks instead. We worked every day and every evening because the work was never finished
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.200]   Once 7 p.m. Rolled around in New York City my colleagues in Hong Kong Taiwan and Singapore
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.080]   Started to trickle in at around 7 a.m. Their time
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.760]   Oftentimes I had to be online until 9 p.m. Ensuring my requests were
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.920]   Executed before I went to bed. Just imagine if you had a client request from a big fund manager in New York City and
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.160]   He wanted to know more about Hong Kong property
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.200]   So you go and contact the assistant or the research analyst about Hong Kong property to try to get some information
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.720]   Just imagine if you wake up the next day and you don't get any of that information
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.320]   You're gonna look like a fool or just incompetent in front of your client and you're not gonna do well
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.780]   So there's this constant anxiety and I knew it most the people in the international equities department
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.840]   We're always on and always trying to get information and data to help our clients
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.360]   hmm, so maybe the experience that millions of knowledge workers have experienced since 2020 is
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.120]   What I've been experiencing are what I had experienced for 13 years working in international equities and finance
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.440]   So I couldn't last folks, which is why I think the quiet quitting movement could be really good for all workers
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.520]   The main reason why I did more than the minimum was because I knew it just was just too brutal
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.680]   To get in at 5 30 a.m. And leave after 7 p.m. For decades
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.680]   Therefore I logically worked the maximum number of hours I could bear while trying to get paid and promoted quicker
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.400]   I figured if I averaged 65 hours a week for 20 years
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.240]   That would be like a 40 hour a week person working for 33 years
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.440]   It's not quite the same math obviously, but that's how I thought you work hard
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.800]   It compressed the amount of work to get paid and promoted quicker so I could leave
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.920]   sooner I
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.920]   Was I would say unlucky not to have landed a relatively low stress nine-to-five job that it enabled
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.280]   Workers to quiet quit for 30 to 40 years
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:30.280]   Look online look on tik-tok. It's pretty hilarious and pretty creative of these people who profile their days, you know coming into work
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:37.160]   Socializing eating vegan panna cotta. Yeah for free. Not bad for folks who work at LinkedIn and
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.360]   It sounds great and it's smart right? It's obviously
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.880]   Sensationalized as a creator you want to make things look better than it really is
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.680]   but the point is if you have the confidence and the ability to
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.960]   Highlight that you're working one to two hours a day while you're just socializing and fraternizing with friends online and not fearing getting laid off
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.160]   That shows the power of what your work-life balance is
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.000]   It shows that you actually really do have a pretty good work-life balance
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.440]   I know if I posted a video of how I was only working a couple hours a week at Goldman Sachs or Credit Suisse
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.740]   I would probably be set aside by my HR manager and maybe fired if I did it a second or third time, right?
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:27.120]   But things have changed and I think the dynamic of the work environment has changed and maybe our managers are younger now
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.840]   And they also want more work-life balance hence quiet quitting and at the same time
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.600]   I was also lucky to have gotten a job that had a strong correlation with performance and reward
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.160]   For at least the first 10 years the harder I worked the better
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:49.460]   I did with my clients the more I got paid and the quicker I got promoted and this broke down after the global financial crisis in
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.460]   2008 to 2009 and then for several years after you know
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.480]   The companies a lot of companies in finance were hemorrhaging money
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.120]   We were struggling so we needed to build back our balance sheets and therefore the pay wasn't that great
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:10.680]   and so naturally workers got less motivated including myself and I wanted to do something new as
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.160]   Result by shutting the quiet quitting movement in my 20s and 30s
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:22.200]   I was able to break free from the corporate grind for good at age 34 and try to figure out
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.200]   What I wanted to do with the rest of my life and we know this term ikigai
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:33.000]   It's a Japanese concept meaning a reason for being and it's about finding what you love
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.640]   What the world needs?
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:43.560]   What you can be paid for and what you are good at so everybody spend time thinking about your ikigai
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:50.740]   What you love I love to write. I like to speak sometimes, but I love to write and connect with other people
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.840]   What the world needs I think the world needs more
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.460]   financial education better personal financial education
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.840]   Now ask yourself what you can be paid for
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.100]   Based on doing what you love and what the world needs
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:13.040]   I'm lucky because financial samurai generates advertising revenue or some companies want to sponsor
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.120]   Financial samurais newsletter or a post that's pretty cool
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.120]   Especially when I can find products that I really believe in and that I use and then finally
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.840]   What you are good at this takes time to get better
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.000]   but over time I've discovered I am good at writing making people think and
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.280]   Sharing stories and good education. So if you find four of these things
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.000]   You're gonna find ikigai and if you find ikigai
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.640]   You will feel less burned out and feel more purposeful every single day
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:53.000]   It's the reason why I've been able to publish three times a week since July 2009
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.520]   It's not easy folks writing 1,000 to 4,000 word articles three times a week plus a weekly newsletter
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.720]   But I love it and it helps people and there's an income component and I'm good at it
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.660]   So find your ikigai now, let's go back to quiet quitting again
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.320]   There are two main ways to get ahead. The first way to get ahead is to work harder than most people
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.000]   Eventually, you hope your results will bring you the rewards you think you deserve
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.520]   Going this path is for someone who strongly believes in meritocracy and a lot of corporations. They talk about meritocracy
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:33.240]   However, as we all know the best or the hardest working people don't always rise to the top
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.760]   due to nepotism
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.880]   Advertisement bad luck and systemic issues. That's just the way the world is folks
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.400]   The second way to get ahead is to convince other people to try less hard than you
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:54.480]   Encouraging a movement for quiet quitters who do the minimum on the job relieves the stress of the average worker and by definition
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.760]   Most people are average
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.120]   70 to 80 percent of people are on the average part of the curve the bell curve
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:08.520]   For example, maybe the average worker works only eight point five hours a day when they are only required to work eight hours a day
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.200]   Right, that's above and beyond what is required technically
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.600]   But they feel bad because they know they can do so much more they can work probably ten hours a day
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.900]   But you know what eight and a half so long as they're averaged above average, they're okay
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:29.480]   But if more colleagues start checking out after seven and a half eight hours, then the average person will now outperform
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.480]   Without having to change their ways and if you're feeling burned out
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.120]   That's pretty great. If the collective can lower that bar
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:46.840]   The main reason why so many of us experience burnout is that there's this arms race for ever-increasing
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.200]   Desire for corporations to sell more widgets and make more and more and more money
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:57.920]   Capitalism is great for achieving improvements in technology safety health food and education
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.160]   However, there comes a point where there is enough enough is enough
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:11.280]   But there is never enough in a capitalistic society. We've got shareholders to report to board members
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.760]   employees to feed and
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:20.120]   This is the cycle of life. So we have to figure out how to break that cycle and accept enough
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:28.040]   Because besides feeling permanently on call other reasons for burnout include feeling like your work has no impact, right?
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.520]   No matter what you do, it's the broken steering
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:37.420]   Well, you can't steer the car the way that you want to go and you don't believe the company's mission
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.360]   I mean if you are working at a sugary drink company
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:49.320]   I mean, do you really believe in the mission of pumping 200 calories worth of and 16 tablespoons of sugar in each can of
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:55.600]   You know soda. I don't I don't think that's that's the not the mission that you probably believe in
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:02.120]   But you do it because you need the money most of us work because we need the money and that is acceptable
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:08.960]   But eventually you're gonna get to a point where you have enough money where you can do other things for less pay
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.560]   Or maybe retire early or just at least take a break
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.120]   and so that is that gray area where hopefully we all eventually come to where we
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:23.040]   Reconsider what we want to do with our lives how we want to make money and what kind of impact we want to leave in
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:30.320]   This world so that is eeky guy again now quiet quitting I think is really good for working parents as well
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:36.840]   I would say if there's one demographic group that has suffered the most amount of anxiety and worry during the pandemic
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.620]   It's parents of young children and that's me
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:47.880]   So I'm selfishly talking about how I've been experiencing a lot of work stress and anxiety since 2020
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.840]   Just trying to be real with you all because when you're a new parent
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:57.520]   Everything is new and when you have a helpless person depending on you, you don't want to mess that up
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.920]   You definitely don't want them to get hurt or God forbid die on you. That's the worst nightmare
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.480]   and so for parents just struggling to balance work and
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:13.640]   To balance child care and love it's been really difficult. And so quiet quitting
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.500]   Enables parents to think about the future and maybe a less stressful way
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:25.960]   Because if you realize how brutally competitive the world is you also realize how much you have to do as a parent to prepare your children
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:32.360]   To compete survive and hopefully thrive in the future. The world is just getting smaller. Thanks to technology
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.240]   better economic international cooperation and
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:42.040]   Companies are going to where labor costs are the lowest and the most efficient, right?
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.480]   So if you don't have that knowledge and that skill
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.640]   To compete in a developed country like America then life is going to be much more difficult
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.980]   so with quiet quitting if we can lower the bar and have people not grind as
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.320]   Hard or at least keep the bar in place
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.260]   This provides more hope for parents and their children
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:09.240]   I have a three-pronged plan to help my children and this includes step one
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:15.480]   Providing supplemental homeschooling because we have more time I can homeschool them in English Mandarin
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.760]   math science writing speaking
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.240]   entrepreneurship marketing investing real estate stocks and overall personal finance
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:28.720]   Something that is missing in schools step two is keeping financial samurai going for a while
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:35.480]   You know a small business to provide real-time real-world education is quite impactful
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:41.600]   That's something that I wish I had when I was growing up and I finally got when I went to business school part-time at Berkeley
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:47.120]   I was working in finance and I was studying finance. So all that I was learning was really really helpful
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:53.400]   That was the most accelerated time of learning in my opinion when I could do and learn at the same time
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.960]   And then three build a rental property portfolio, which I've already built
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:05.400]   But I might want to accumulate more over time and real estate is about security. It's about stability. It's about income
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.800]   the portfolio can be managed by them if they need work and
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:15.460]   The portfolio can provide shelter if they need a place to stay if they can't get a job that pays enough
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:21.200]   So the irony of doing these three things is that it helps lower my parental anxiety
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.320]   because it gives me hope that they're not gonna fall through the cracks and
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:32.160]   Just end up doing nothing with their lives because we're gonna be involved right taking action feels good
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.000]   Because you feel that you're improving your situation
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.920]   Maybe you're not but at least you're taking action to hopefully change the course of the future for the better
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:47.640]   Now if quiet quitting takes off no longer will parents have to worry about the children
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:55.020]   Getting straight A's or not getting straight A's and if they get a B in a subject your kid doesn't like it's okay
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:00.280]   Don't have to stress out. It's fine and no longer will kids have to pursue endless
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:07.760]   Curricular activities and sports and music and arts to the point where they're falling asleep in class the next day
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.080]   They don't need to cure cancer as a teenager anymore. I mean that's gone
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.760]   I mean, hopefully teenagers will cure cancer but having to cure cancer to get into a good school
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:25.760]   No longer required and come on now these good schools that talk about trying to educate the world while keeping the admissions rate
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.480]   The same and keeping the number of spots the same even though they've expanded
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.840]   That's pretty hypocritical folks. Come on now and the reason why schools do that is because they are
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.760]   Also in the arms race for status and prestige
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:48.320]   Right, it just never ever ends until we make it end and we decide what's enough for parents
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.380]   We no longer have to spend as much on expensive music and sports lessons
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:00.440]   bribing college officials, you know that all goes away all that money can thus be saved and
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.960]   Go towards our own
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:10.240]   Retirements now in addition. Thanks to quiet quitting parents won't feel a need to spend a fortune on college or college at all
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:18.320]   The reason why many elite colleges are winning is because they know many parents are willing to pay anything for their children's education
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.080]   the less
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.400]   Important a college education is for getting a job
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:30.400]   The lower the price of college tuition should be but it's not happening that way even though there's the internet
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.440]   Podcasts blogs and everything and it's because of this
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:39.240]   Heightened anxiety by parents to just spend anything because they don't want to screw things up for their kids
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:46.960]   But if you read by this not that my book you will hopefully see through the absurdity of paying any amount for college
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.960]   Instead the chapter on education provides a really great framework for how much you should
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.760]   comfortably spend
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:01.000]   based on your household income and based on the logic of the importance of education how you can attain
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.480]   education and the jobs you can attain with that education as well in conclusion as
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:12.920]   a parent and as someone who is observing what's going on in society with work and
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.080]   Life, I hope the quiet quitting movement grows
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:22.620]   I hope it gets to the managers who also probably want to get but also probably feel crushed by this
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:29.400]   Blurring of boundaries between work and personal life and if more workers can sustain a longer career
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.720]   20 30 40 years and not just peace out and see you later
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.880]   Like I did after 13 years that actually might be good for corporate profits that might be good for our country
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.880]   Just accept that everything is rational though folks
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:49.120]   So if you want to partake in the quiet quitting movement, you've got to be okay with the results
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.640]   Whether it's good times or bad times your promotion and pay
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:58.960]   please be congruent with your actions and your beliefs about what you deserve and then if you don't want to
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:04.720]   Participate in the quiet quitting movement and you want to grind ahead further you can use this opportunity to get further ahead
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.520]   Make more money get paid and leave work altogether sooner if you want
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:15.480]   There's two sides to this situation and I think there are great benefits to both
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:21.600]   I'd love to hear your thoughts about the quiet quitting movement in the post leave a comment or shoot me an email
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.520]   I think it's gonna be an interesting time for the next two years or longer
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.140]   And if you enjoyed this episode, I'd appreciate a positive review
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:37.700]   It keeps me motivated and going and also shout out to new retirement for creating a wonderful retirement planner from the ground up
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:44.640]   They've come a long way over the past couple years since I last reviewed them and they've got some great new features to help you
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.280]   Plan for a better future. Thanks so much everyone
