[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.920]   All right, let's move on now.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.720]   Our next question is from Gary.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.680]   Gary says, what is the difference between the productivity funnel
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.600]   and the capture configure control method?
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.080]   All right, well, now we're getting into the weeds, which I appreciate.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.320]   These are two different productivity-related frameworks
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.360]   or systems I have discussed at various times on this podcast.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.680]   So for those who don't remember the productivity funnel,
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.920]   this was my way of trying to give a framework for professional productivity
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.600]   in general.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.280]   I said any approach to professional productivity
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.920]   can be understood as implementing the three layers of a funnel,
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.440]   where at the very top of the funnel, you have what I called activity selection.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.520]   What is my philosophy or systems or figuring out what I actually work on?
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.400]   In the middle of the funnel, you have organization.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.400]   How do I make sense of and keep track of all of the different things
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.440]   I have selected to do, the things that did enter onto my proverbial plate?
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.720]   And then the narrowest part at the bottom, the bottom level of the funnel,
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.600]   was execution.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.440]   How do I actually execute effectively the thing
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.680]   that I should be executing right now in the moment?
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.040]   So my argument is any professional productivity system or philosophy
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.280]   has to have a coherent approach to each of those three layers.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.760]   Capture, configure, control is one element
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.480]   you might use in implementing, in particular, the organization layer.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.400]   So it is an instantiation of you need some way of organizing
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.040]   all of these things on your plate in the time you have available.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.280]   You need some way of doing it.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.080]   One way you could do that is with things like capture, configure, control.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.400]   And so if you remember capture, configure, control in that system,
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.680]   which comes from the early days of the podcast,
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.960]   it talks about how you need to have a way of capturing
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.120]   the things you need to do.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.680]   You need a way of making sense of the things on your plate,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.160]   and you need to control your time.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.400]   So have some control over when do I actually want to do this work.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.400]   And those types of ideas roughly fall under organization.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.240]   I mean, you might argue that capture maybe overlaps a little bit
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.280]   with activity selection, but it's really just a David Allen inspired idea
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.800]   that no open loops.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.280]   Configure, that's what is your system for actually tracking
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.200]   and keeping track of these things.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.320]   And control is you should actually be doing something like time block planning,
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.840]   figuring out here's my time available, and here's what I want to do.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.240]   So I think the right way to think about capture, configure, control
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.360]   is that zoom in on the organizational level of the productivity funnel.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.080]   And once you're there, this is one way you might start to implement that funnel.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.040]   Where this actually gets confusing is that capture, configure, control
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.000]   is itself also somewhat general.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.040]   So I don't say specifically how to configure or specifically
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.600]   how to control your time.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.640]   So it's a more refined framework for what
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.680]   you might find in that middle layer of the productivity funnel.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.360]   You would then go in and actually implement those things
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.000]   with real systems.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.320]   I'm going to use a Trello board for configure.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.040]   I'm going to use a time block planner for control.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.080]   Now, this sounds really recursive and complicated.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.680]   That's because these aren't really supposed to nest, Gary.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.120]   These are just two alternative ways of talking about productivity.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.920]   So I wouldn't try to nest these two.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.520]   I would say, look, you can think about I want a capture, configure,
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.280]   and control system.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.520]   Or you can think about I want to implement the three
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.240]   layers of the productivity funnel and think about it.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.960]   And they inform each other.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.480]   But they're both kind of trying to do the same thing.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.400]   And so maybe think of the productivity funnel
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.360]   as my second attempt at having a general framework
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.520]   for professional productivity.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.520]   Because I realize that execution is important.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.560]   And how we even select what should be on our plate
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.040]   or how much work we should be doing is important.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.160]   So maybe you could think of the productivity funnel
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.120]   as being a more general swing at what I was trying to do
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.680]   with capture, configure, control.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.640]   But if you like one better than the other,
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.240]   you're perfectly fine sticking with it.
