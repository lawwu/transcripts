[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.080]   Welcome back to a new week of episodes
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.040]   with John Piper on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.880]   We have a question here from Eileen, a listener,
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.920]   who writes in to ask this, "Hello Pastor John.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.060]   "How should a wife who desires to be godly
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.480]   "react to her husband's habit of spending
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.560]   "about 70% of mealtimes together communicating
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.560]   "with others via texts and social media on his phone?
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.660]   "It irritates me so much that sometimes I lose myself.
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.500]   "Thank you."
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.520]   So Pastor John, what counsel would you offer to Eileen?
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.060]   I think Eileen is not alone here in her concern,
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.360]   and I don't know what the proportions are,
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.360]   but there are many men, as well as women,
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.680]   who are frustrated when their wives are distracted
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.760]   by something during a time when it seems
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.840]   like the two of them should be paying attention
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.760]   to each other, so I just wanna make sure
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.480]   that women know that we men like
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.140]   to be paid attention to, as well.
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.340]   (laughs)
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.940]   And it is right that her husband pay attention to her.
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.760]   There are a couple of questions here in Eileen's concern,
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.600]   I think.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.520]   One is what might be said to her husband.
