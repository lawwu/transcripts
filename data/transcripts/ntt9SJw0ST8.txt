[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100]   So let's go to the talking paradox.
[00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.300]   If you want your ideas to be heard,
[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.700]   you should listen twice as much as you speak.
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.660]   And again, it's counter to what you would think,
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.660]   which is the more I talk,
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.360]   the more I push my ideas out there.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.380]   If I'm in a room, I need to be the loudest one.
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.780]   I need to get my ideas heard.
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.340]   Completely counter to that,
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.660]   the people that you actually listen to the most
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.060]   are the people that listen a whole lot.
[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.500]   And then when they do speak,
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.660]   It is incredibly pointed, interesting, insightful speaking.
