[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   Well, how do we get tricked into sinning?
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.080]   Tricked into sinning?
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.840]   Yes, that's the question on the table today, and the answer is found in Romans chapter
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.520]   6, verses 22 to 23, as we will hear in a sermon clip from Pastor John two decades ago.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.560]   This clip was sent in to us by Gabriela, a listener to the podcast who lives in Sweden.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.640]   She writes this, that quote, "The following sermon clip has been very helpful for me in
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.320]   understanding the nature of sin and the true freedom we have in Christ.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.380]   Living as a Christian in probably the most secular country in the world, the concept
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.420]   of being a slave in a culture that seems free and independent is very controversial.
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.240]   This sermon gave me the tools I needed to reach some unbelievers in my life."
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.600]   End quote.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.600]   Incredible.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.880]   Well, here's a clip from Pastor John's sermon back in the year 2000, sent to us by Gabriela
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.880]   in Sweden.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.640]   Here's the clip.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.280]   Nobody sins out of duty.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:14.880]   You only sin because the master makes it look so appealing, so pleasant to do his bidding
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.400]   and to keep his will and do his commands.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.960]   So when we obey sin, it feels free.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.240]   It doesn't feel like earning wages.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.980]   My guess is if you're here in this room right now and you're outside Christ, you're not
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:44.220]   a believer and you're hearing me say that belonging to the slave master's sin is like
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.800]   earning wages.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.400]   You're saying to yourself, "It doesn't feel like that to me.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.720]   Feels free.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.120]   I'm doing what I want to do and it feels good when I do it.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.000]   That doesn't feel like going to work."
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.480]   So why does Paul call it wages?
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:16.160]   If sin rules over his slaves like that, why does he call it wages?
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.240]   Two reasons.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.960]   One, wages deplete life.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.440]   They do for you.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.040]   That's why you want to get paid, right?
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.040]   You don't put in 40, 50, 60 hours a week and say, "No cost to me.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.320]   I didn't lose anything."
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.760]   You want your money and you ought to get your money because you were depleted.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.320]   Time was taken away from you.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.760]   Energy was taken away from you.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.200]   Thought was taken away from you.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.680]   Life was taken away from what might have been doing other things and you invested it in
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:02.680]   that employer's cause and now you want some restoration of the depletion called wages
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.480]   and that's the way sin is.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.520]   And he's got it all concealed.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.120]   He's got it all concealed.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:27.960]   It's like a Dracula who develops a magic potion which he gives to his victims so that every
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.120]   time they give a pint of blood, they get a high.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.320]   And so he comes and says, "Let me have your blood.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.240]   You'll get a high."
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.160]   And they will.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.120]   And when they get the high, they say, "See, it feels good.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.120]   I'm not earning wages here.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.040]   I'm not being depleted here.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.720]   I'm receiving a high."
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.200]   And all the while, your life is being drained away.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.880]   The wages of sin is death.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.000]   You get depleted.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.640]   It's death now, little by little.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.160]   Can't feel it.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:25.640]   If he keeps you deceived and in the end, all you get is the end of your life from sin.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.880]   He never pays anything like restoration.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.080]   He's a deceiver.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.920]   So the first reason why he calls it wages is that it's like wages.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.160]   Sin - every time you sin, you lose.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.600]   Every time you sin, you are depleted.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.600]   You're drawn out.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.080]   And it goes and it goes.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.600]   And in the end, it will all go.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.640]   And there will be left one drop of blood in you.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:02.000]   And your high will end and never come again.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:13.360]   The other reason is because when you obey sin, you get exactly what you deserve, like
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.720]   wages.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.600]   Death will be like wages.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.400]   It's a strange way to describe death.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:32.880]   Wages, benefits, benefits, insurance and retirement and whatever else, major medical.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.360]   The benefits, what are they?
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.760]   Death.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.080]   That's your benefits in relationship with this master.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.160]   They're all summed up in one word, death.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.360]   And you deserve them.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.320]   He's a cruel master and a deceiver.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.280]   And oh, how we should hate him.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.000]   Do you hate him?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.720]   Or do you love him?
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.520]   Has he tricked you into loving him?
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.920]   Loving him.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:11.640]   Jesus came into the world and says, "And men love darkness rather than light."
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.280]   They loved him.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.760]   Do you love your master?
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:27.640]   Your liar, your deceiver, your depleter, your non-pay-upper who's got you enslaved?
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.320]   Do you love him?
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.560]   Or do you love God and hate him and fight him like this chapter says you're supposed
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.440]   to do?
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.280]   Let's go to the last third contrasting pair.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.840]   Death versus eternal life.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.800]   The wages of sin is death.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.120]   The free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.160]   So the ultimate summary of the wage here of sin that he pays is death.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.760]   And the ultimate summary of the gift here that God gives and doesn't pay is eternal
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.760]   life.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.240]   And if the life is eternal in contrast with death, the death must be conceived of as eternal
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.240]   as well.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.520]   And we could go to numerous texts in Paul to show that that is in fact the case.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:26.760]   And right here, oh how the parallel breaks down between slave master sin and slave master
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.440]   God.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:42.760]   Because sin, slave master sin has absolutely no say and no hand in the giving of the gift
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.160]   of life by master God.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:58.720]   But God has total say and a sovereign hand in the paying of the wages of death from master
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.520]   sin.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.760]   There's no parallel here.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:11.040]   What you find when you think it through is, "Ah, he's a pretender.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.800]   He's not a slave master after all.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.720]   There's only one slave master in the universe and that's God.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.920]   There's only one owner and that's God.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.960]   There's only one sovereign and that's God.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.560]   There's only one giver and that's God.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.800]   And this rascal has been pretending to the throne of my life ever since the beginning
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   and tricked and tricked and drained and drained.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:43.280]   And he can't even pay at the end the wages of death.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.400]   Sin doesn't pay the wages of death.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.960]   It's a trick.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.600]   He doesn't pay them.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.560]   God pays them.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:09:00.440]   It's like a pimp and a prostitute.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:22.560]   Hell is the wage of sin the way venereal disease and prison time is the wage from a
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.880]   pimp in the prostitute.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.520]   He didn't pay it.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.480]   He's gone.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.160]   He's just gone.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.480]   He tricks.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.680]   He lures.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.120]   He cheats.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.200]   He devises.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.280]   He distorts.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.600]   And when he's done, the prostitute's got the disease.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.440]   The prostitute comes before the court and goes to jail.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.440]   He's gone.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.440]   He's gone.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.160]   Sin is a liar.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.160]   He even lies about his lies.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.240]   He even lies about his wages.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:12.720]   He can't even produce the bads, let alone the goods.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.440]   Oh how we should hate him.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:23.720]   Oh how free you should want to be right now from this slave master's clutches on your
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:30.040]   life so that you're not a dupe and a lackey day in and day out like most people seem to
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.040]   be.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.040]   Hate him.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.040]   Hate him.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:40.200]   Hate sin with all your might as the master of your life.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.360]   When he tempts you and lures you and promises you and makes all his demands look pleasant
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.640]   to you, throw it back in his face with the Word of God.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.840]   Get free with the mirror of the Word.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:58.480]   Show yourself and what you were created for and what he's trying to make you think you're
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.480]   for.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.480]   Hmm, powerful.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.160]   That clip was shared with us by Gabriela, a listener from Sweden.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.160]   Thank you, Gabriela.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.920]   And the clip is from John Piper's sermon on December 17th, 2000, titled "The Free Gift
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.560]   of God is Eternal Life."
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.880]   You can find it right now at DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.760]   Well we asked a few years back and just recently restarted to ask you for your favorite sermon
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.840]   clips and you have responded really well.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.840]   So thank you.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.000]   Keep them coming.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.880]   Give me the title of the sermon and the timestamps of when the audio of the clip that you like
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.160]   begins and ends.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.360]   And if you wish, tell me why it's impacted you.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.040]   Give me your name and the closest city to you.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:42.840]   Anything that I can share online with our community and email me at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.360]   That's our email address, AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.200]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line, please.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.560]   I'd appreciate it.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.920]   And maybe we can share it here on the podcast.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.960]   Well next up on the docket, when do I know if God is correcting me?
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:03.480]   Sometimes God disciplines us to confront our sin and to get us to repent and change course.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.720]   That's certainly true.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.200]   But according to Scripture, at other times God sends suffering into our lives not for
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.120]   correction but simply to teach us how to endure patiently.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:18.360]   So how do we know when he's correcting us and when he's building endurance in us?
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.480]   It's a great question and what would you expect from the APJ audience really?
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.200]   But just great questions like this one.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.200]   It's up next time.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.560]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.960]   We'll see you back here on Friday.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.960]   God bless.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:30.960]   Bye.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.960]   1
