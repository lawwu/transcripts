[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.880]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.300]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.240]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.080]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.200]   Today, we are discussing nicotine.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.840]   Nicotine is one of the most commonly consumed substances
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.620]   on the entire planet.
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.720]   There are literally billions of people
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.640]   that ingest nicotine on a daily basis.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.680]   Most of those people consume nicotine via smoking
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.880]   and in particular, smoking tobacco.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.400]   Tobacco contains nicotine,
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.920]   and it contains a bunch of other things as well,
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.160]   which we will talk about.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.400]   And the burning of tobacco liberates nicotine
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.840]   and makes it accessible to the various cells
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.160]   and tissues of the body.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.700]   But of course, there are other sources of nicotine as well.
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.220]   Some people consume nicotine through dip,
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.160]   that is placing tobacco on the inside of the lip
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.840]   or in the cheek.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.440]   Some people consume nicotine via snuff,
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.360]   which is literally the shoving of tobacco leaves up
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.360]   the nostrils and allowing the tobacco to access
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.900]   the nervous system and other areas of the body
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.460]   by permeating into the mucosal membranes,
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.840]   as is the lining, the soft lining of the nasal passages.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.680]   And of course, there are nicotine patches, nicotine gum,
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.340]   there's nicotine in pill form,
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.160]   there are toothpicks dipped in nicotine, et cetera.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.860]   Today, we are going to separate our discussion of nicotine
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.240]   from a discussion of smoking and vaping
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.520]   and the other forms of delivery for nicotine.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.080]   We will be talking about smoking and vaping
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.480]   and other routes of nicotine administration,
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.800]   both for sake of highlighting their detriments to health
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.520]   and believe it or not, in certain cases,
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.040]   keep in mind, very specific certain cases,
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.040]   the possible health benefits of delivering nicotine
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.560]   through specific modalities.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.240]   It turns out those modalities do not include
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.800]   smoking cigarettes or vaping.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.880]   And we are going to pay particular attention
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.320]   to vaping today because vaping use is on the rise,
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.360]   in particular in young people and vaping use
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.640]   and the fact that most tobacco that's consumed
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.760]   through vaping includes quite amount of nicotine
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.040]   has created a scenario where nicotine,
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.500]   because of its ability to change certain chemicals
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.200]   in the brain can actually lead to addiction
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.560]   for a number of other substances related to vaping
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.520]   and vaping associated behaviors.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.860]   If all of that seems like a lot to get your arms
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.640]   and your mind around right here at the outset, don't worry,
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.200]   I'll walk you through this regardless of whether or not
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.920]   you have a background in biology or not.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.940]   I promise that you'll come through the end of this episode
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.280]   with a deep understanding of how nicotine works
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.640]   in the brain and body, some of its benefits,
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.280]   some of its potential drawbacks,
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.420]   and you'll have clear optics as to why smoking and vaping
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.920]   and other forms of nicotine delivery have the effects
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.840]   that they do on your biology and psychology.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.720]   I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab podcast
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.060]   is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.280]   We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.000]   First of all, they ship internationally
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.920]   because we know that many of you are located
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.440]   outside of the United States.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.440]   Second of all, and perhaps most important,
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.000]   the quality of their supplements is second to none,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.660]   both in terms of purity and precision
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.600]   of the amounts of the ingredients.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.240]   Third, we've really emphasized supplements
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.440]   that are single ingredient supplements
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.220]   and that are supplied in dosages that allow you
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.460]   to build a supplementation protocol
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.300]   that's optimized for cost,
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.180]   that's optimized for effectiveness,
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.320]   and that you can add things and remove things
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.640]   from your protocol in a way
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.440]   that's really systematic and scientific.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.600]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.940]   that we partner with Momentus on,
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.040]   you can go to livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.160]   There you'll see those supplements,
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.640]   and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.340]   the library of supplements available through Momentus
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.280]   on a regular basis.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.880]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.920]   Before we go any further,
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.180]   I just want to highlight a key takeaway
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.960]   from a previous episode, which is our episode on focus,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.820]   and in fact was a toolkit for focus.
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.580]   So during the toolkit for focus episode,
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.920]   we talked about a large number of behavioral pharmacologic
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.160]   and other interventions that you can use
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.660]   to increase your level of concentration and focus
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.020]   for whatever purpose, cognitive endeavors,
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.220]   learning languages, focusing in school,
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.220]   on work, et cetera, or physical pursuits.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.000]   Now, one of the key takeaways
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.520]   is that there are really two key protocols
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.840]   that I believe everyone should understand and know about
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.540]   and why they work, because they are so effective,
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.780]   and also because they dovetail nicely
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.760]   with some of the information
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.380]   that we're going to talk about today,
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.160]   which will explain why nicotine is so effective
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160]   in increasing focus.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.620]   And these two protocols are as follows.
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.760]   Data based on studies done in Wendy Suzuki's lab
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.440]   at New York University,
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.940]   and of course, Wendy was a guest on this podcast,
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.720]   so you can check out that episode if you like,
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.520]   but studies done in her laboratory point to the fact
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.040]   that a daily very brief, in fact, only 13-minute meditation,
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.400]   can vastly increase focus and focusability,
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.560]   not just immediately after the meditation practice,
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.640]   but at all other times as well.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.580]   So again, this is a meditation practice done daily
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.660]   for just 13 minutes.
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.180]   It's a very simple meditation practice
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.460]   where one sits or lies down, closes your eyes,
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.420]   and directs your attention to a place
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.740]   just between your two eyes and right above it,
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.800]   so on your forehead, but just inside of that.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.000]   And please understand
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.840]   that your brain does not have sensory receptors,
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.700]   so unlike focusing on your fingertips
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.540]   and the sensations there, if you focus on your brain,
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.420]   you can't actually sense anything in your brain
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.260]   except your thoughts.
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.380]   So the idea then is that you continually bring your focus
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.380]   back to that location just about an inch behind your forehead
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.220]   over and over again,
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.340]   and it's the refocusing of your attention to that location
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.420]   after it drifts that succeeds
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.000]   in increasing your focusability,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.280]   again, not just during the meditation and afterward,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.900]   but at other times as well.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.660]   So this 13-minute-a-day meditation is exceedingly simple
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.460]   and exceedingly effective.
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.020]   It should be performed every day, but if you miss a day,
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.400]   just go back to doing it, don't despair too much,
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.760]   and you will see these positive effects save the data,
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.500]   also increase effects on mood
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.340]   and other positive aspects of mental health and performance.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.140]   So that's the first tool in protocol.
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.840]   The second tool in protocol relates to the general,
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.660]   what I call the aero model of focus.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.060]   This was a model that I created
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.340]   in order to simplify the vast amounts of data
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.060]   on focus and concentration and how they are created
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.020]   by the various chemical systems within your brain.
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.880]   We're going to hear a lot about these chemical systems,
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.420]   again, today in the context of nicotine,
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.400]   and they are as follows.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.140]   You can think about focus on any goal or any endeavor
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.940]   as an aero, so just imagine an aero,
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.740]   which has an aero head and a shaft,
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.820]   and we'll add a third component to it in a moment.
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.680]   The head of the aero, meaning the direction of your focus,
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.140]   is largely set by acetylcholine,
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.660]   which is a chemical in the brain.
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.060]   The shaft of the aero is set by a chemical called adrenaline,
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.420]   also called epinephrine, those are the same thing.
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.220]   In the brain, typically it's referred to as epinephrine,
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.380]   and in the body, it's more commonly referred to
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.040]   as adrenaline, but those are the same neurochemical.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.060]   Epinephrine/adrenaline represents the shaft of the aero,
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.180]   and it's providing the energy for which to focus.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.660]   And then we can put behind that aero a little propeller
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.320]   or a motor, if you like, and the propeller or motor
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.420]   in the context of this neurochemistry model is dopamine,
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.140]   which provides ongoing motivation.
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.640]   It pushes that aero forward continually
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.140]   as you strive to focus on a particular thing.
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.700]   This particular aero model,
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.620]   that is your ability to increase your focus,
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.060]   can be enhanced therefore by increasing acetylcholine,
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.660]   epinephrine, and dopamine simultaneously.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.360]   And there are a lot of different ways to do that,
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.380]   but one of the more effective ways to do that
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.160]   via supplement protocols is so-called alpha-GPC.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.780]   Alpha-GPC taken in 300 milligram form,
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.380]   10 to 30 minutes before a bout of cognitive work
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.060]   or a bout of physical work will increase your focus
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.700]   by way of increasing acetylcholine and to some extent,
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.820]   increasing epinephrine as well.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.820]   The dopamine increase will have to be achieved
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.140]   either through cognitive processing,
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.840]   that is telling yourself you're doing a good job
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.140]   and moving forward because thoughts really do impact
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.740]   your levels of dopamine or some other sort of pro-dopamine
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.860]   or dopamine increasing protocol,
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.120]   also discussed in the toolkit for focus
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.020]   and our episode on dopamine for motivation and drive.
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.460]   So the key thing here to understand
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.540]   is that the 13 minute a day meditation
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.180]   is a very effective way to increase focus capacity.
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.440]   And then in the short term,
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.580]   if you want to provide a boost now and again to focus,
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.360]   300 milligrams of alpha-GPC can be very effective.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.700]   There are various sources for that.
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.020]   Then we'll link to one of them in the show note captions.
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.740]   By no means am I saying that you need to take alpha-GPC.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.700]   A number of people will certainly opt not to.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.980]   And a number of people might be saying,
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.340]   well, I've heard that alpha-GPC can increase focus
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.020]   by way of increasing acetylcholine and norepinephrine
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.060]   or epinephrine, but it can also increase TMAO,
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.140]   which is a kind of a negative marker of cardiac health
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.640]   and cardiovascular health.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.980]   For that reason, I and many others will take 600 milligrams
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.340]   of a garlic capsule, which can offset that TMAO increase.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.320]   It remains uncertain as to how much alpha-GPC
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.260]   one needs to take before increasing TMAO levels
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.620]   to a point where it's a concern
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.740]   that you would even need to take the garlic capsule.
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.520]   But I just mention it in any case
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.300]   because it's a pretty simple fix.
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.720]   Garlic has other health benefits too, of course.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.760]   And for most people, 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.240]   taken every once in a while.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.780]   I certainly don't encourage people to take alpha-GPC
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.640]   every time they want to focus.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.580]   I always emphasize behavioral tools first,
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.840]   then focusing on nutritional tools,
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.460]   and on occasion using supplement-based tools
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.000]   to encourage increased levels of focus.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.640]   And then of course, there are a number
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.880]   of different prescription compounds
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.100]   that if you're working with a board certified physician,
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.680]   they could prescribe you if you need additional tools
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.420]   for focus, things like Ritalin, Adderall,
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.120]   Modafinil, Armodafinil, Vyvanse, et cetera.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.880]   For many people are going to be important
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.080]   and maybe even necessary for people with ADHD, et cetera.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.620]   But that's a category into itself.
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.280]   And as I always say, I'm not a physician,
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.720]   so I don't prescribe anything.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.360]   I'm a professor, so I profess many things.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.760]   And today I just wanted to pass along
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.480]   or redirect your attention to that episode on focus
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.800]   and highlight those two tools,
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.720]   the 13-minute-a-day meditation
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.680]   and 300-milligram Alpha-GPC for increasing focus capacity
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.440]   and for acutely, that is temporarily,
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.460]   giving an additional boost for about a focus.
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.080]   And of course, if you choose not to use those protocols,
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.200]   that's perfectly fine too.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.520]   There's certainly no obligation.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.760]   They are simply available to you
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.920]   should you choose to try them.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.840]   And if nothing else, you now have in mind
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.080]   the neurochemistry of acetylcholine,
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.480]   epinephrine/adrenaline, and dopamine,
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.960]   and that will really set the stage for understanding
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.160]   just how effective and why nicotine is so effective
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.020]   at increasing focus, motivation,
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.700]   and even, as you'll soon hear,
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.820]   working memory and cognitive capacity.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.440]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.240]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.540]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.140]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.880]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.920]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.580]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.580]   Our first sponsor is Thesus.
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.800]   Thesus makes custom nootropics.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.980]   And to be quite direct, I do not like the word nootropics
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.560]   because it translates to smart drugs.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.840]   And to be direct, again,
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.840]   there is no such thing as a smart drug.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.960]   That is, there's no such thing as a drug
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.440]   that can make you smarter
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.920]   because there is no circuit in the brain for being smart.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.300]   There are circuits in the brain for focus,
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.680]   there are circuits in the brain for task switching,
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.020]   there are circuits in the brain related to creativity,
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.300]   and so on and so forth.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.600]   So the idea that there would be a single smart drug
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.600]   or nootropic is simply foolish.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.080]   And fortunately, Thesus understands this
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.960]   and therefore has created custom nootropics
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.760]   that are designed to get you into the states of mind and body
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.680]   that are optimal for your goals.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.080]   I've been taking Thesus nootropics for quite a while now,
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.760]   and I've been extremely pleased with the results.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.020]   I take a clarity formula that's specifically designed for me
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.040]   prior to long bouts of cognitive work,
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.920]   and I take an energy formula
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.680]   prior to particularly challenging physical workouts.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.880]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.380]   you can go online to takethesus.com/huberman,
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.580]   take a three-minute quiz,
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.800]   and Thesus will send you four different formulas
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.160]   to try in your first month.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.920]   Again, that's takethesus.com/huberman
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.800]   and use the code HUBERMAN at checkout

[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.400]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.880]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.240]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.600]   to help you better reach your health goals.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.500]   I've long been a believer
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.920]   in getting regular blood work done
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.140]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.040]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.660]   can only be analyzed with a quality blood test.
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.980]   One of the major issues with blood tests or DNA tests,
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.560]   however, is that typically you'll get your data back
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.640]   and you won't know what to do with those data.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.440]   Inside Tracker has solved this problem
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.600]   by creating a personalized platform
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.780]   where when you get numbers back
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.440]   about your hormones, metabolic factors, et cetera,
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.480]   it will direct you to specific protocols
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.560]   in the realms of nutrition, exercise, supplementation,
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.560]   and that includes things to do, things to consider,
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.040]   and things not to do in order to bring those numbers
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.600]   into the ranges that are optimal
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.660]   for your immediate and long-term goals.
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.060]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.800]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.320]   to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.720]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.120]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.000]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.820]   The company was founded
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.800]   by two all-American swimmers from Stanford,
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.380]   and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.300]   were designed with performance in mind.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.980]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.820]   of the visual system,
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.360]   and I can tell you that your visual system
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.480]   has to contend with a number of important challenges
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.300]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.480]   Now, Roca understands this,
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.820]   and everything about their eyeglasses were designed
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.780]   in order for you to see with optimal clarity
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.140]   regardless of activities.
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.720]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are superb
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.820]   for wearing while you run or cycle.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.860]   In fact, they were originally designed for that purpose.
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.080]   They're extremely lightweight.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:50.920]   In fact, most of the time,
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.340]   I can't even remember that they're on my face,
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.220]   and they won't fall off if you get sweaty.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.940]   In addition, Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.320]   have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.780]   So while a lot of so-called performance eyeglasses out there
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.600]   will make you look like a cyborg if you want to,
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.000]   and they do have those varieties,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.020]   they also have varieties of aesthetic choices
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.240]   that you would be very comfortable wearing to work
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.160]   or to school or just out and about,
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.220]   and that's one of the reasons I like them.
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.120]   I don't really have to think about
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.520]   having too many pairs of sunglasses or eyeglasses.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.320]   I can just have one or two of each pair,
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.560]   and I'm good to go no matter where I go.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.180]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.640]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.940]   and enter the code Huberman
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.020]   to save 20% off on your first order.
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.380]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.820]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.140]   Let's talk about nicotine
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.560]   and how nicotine impacts our brains, our bodies,
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.180]   our mental performance, our mental health,
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.120]   our physical performance, and our physical health.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.700]   And once again, I want to remind everybody
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.580]   that we really need to separate out
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.300]   a discussion about nicotine
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.740]   from the discussion about the delivery device for nicotine.
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.080]   In other words, when we're talking about nicotine,
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.640]   we are not necessarily talking about smoking,
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.980]   although we might be.
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.460]   There are things associated with smoking and with vaping
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.820]   and other means of getting nicotine into our system
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.600]   that have their own effects,
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.000]   both negative and in some cases, positive.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.780]   Indeed, later we will talk about
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.600]   how you can actually use nicotine
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.100]   to get over smoking addiction.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.180]   This won't come as a surprise to many people,
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.380]   but what perhaps will come as a surprise
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.420]   is the fact that many people
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.040]   actually use nicotine-like substances or nicotine itself
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.500]   in order to relieve nicotine addiction.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.420]   So we'll talk about that and what that looks like
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.220]   and offer various protocols for you later in the episode.
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.700]   I also want to mention here at the outset
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.620]   that I have a longstanding interest in nicotine.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.680]   In fact, early in my scientific career,
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.500]   I did research on nicotine and its role in brain development
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.880]   and I've had a longstanding interest in neuroplasticity,
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.500]   the brain's ability to change in response to experience.
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.840]   And so experiments that have been done
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.500]   by close colleagues and friends of mine
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.100]   have really emphasized the fact that acetylcholine
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.480]   and in particular, when acetylcholine
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.340]   activates so-called nicotinic receptors,
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.640]   something you'll learn more about in a little bit,
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.900]   that can actually serve as a gateway or a trigger
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.180]   for directed rewiring of the brain.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.100]   So this is fascinating.
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.380]   We think of nicotine as something that we take,
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.660]   but actually we have receptors,
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.660]   that is locations in the brain to which nicotine binds
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.680]   and can exert its effects.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.280]   And those receptors did not come about
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.140]   because of the existence of tobacco
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.940]   or the existence of vaping pens
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.980]   or because of the existence of anything in the outside world.
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.560]   The fact that there are nicotinic receptors
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.520]   in our brain and body
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.840]   tells you that acetylcholine and nicotine themselves
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.640]   have very important roles in normal brain and body function.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.540]   So much so that I often like to point to an anecdote
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:48.300]   of a very well-known Nobel prize winning neuroscientist.
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.460]   I won't reveal who they are.
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.960]   They're not a faculty member at Stanford,
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.300]   but many neuroscientists know of this person
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.460]   and many people in the outside world know of this person.
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.960]   And they are also well-known for their love of nicotine.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.420]   I once sat in this person's office and he,
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.720]   I will reveal it as a he,
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:10.340]   consumed no fewer than three pieces of nicotine gum
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.380]   during that relatively short conversation
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.860]   of about 45 minutes.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.500]   And that was surprising to me.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.280]   And I asked him why he was taking so much nicotine
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.540]   through nicotine gum.
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.700]   And he replied that for years he had been a chronic smoker,
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.160]   which on the one hand had greatly impaired
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.020]   his cardiovascular health and his fitness,
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:28.860]   no surprise there.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.980]   And we'll talk a little bit more about
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.620]   what the underlying reasons are.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.900]   But most everyone, if not everyone knows
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.260]   that smoking cigarettes or smoking in general
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.840]   really impairs lung health.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.680]   There's just simply no question about it.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.880]   There are some more or less unhealthy ways to smoke,
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.480]   but the quite honest message is that smoking of any kind
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.240]   is going to disrupt lung endothelial function,
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.640]   lung function, blood vessels, and so forth.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.520]   It's going to make it harder to breathe with vigor,
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.840]   take deep breaths, deliver oxygen to tissues, et cetera.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.280]   That said, he also pointed out
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.660]   that the data on nicotine specifically
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.240]   are pointing to the fact that nicotine can be,
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.000]   can be protective against certain forms
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.600]   of cognitive impairment.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.800]   And that is why he continued to chew
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.320]   nicotine containing gum.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.520]   And he swore by the focus enhancing
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.240]   and motivation enhancing effects of nicotine containing gum.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.720]   Now that is not a call to arms for you to run out
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.520]   and start chewing or consuming nicotine containing products.
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.760]   We will talk about those products later in the episode,
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.240]   some of their potential advantages,
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.120]   some of their potential disadvantages.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.380]   Now I share this anecdote because it nicely separates
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.220]   nicotine from the delivery device
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.320]   through which nicotine arrives.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.960]   Now I haven't talked to this individual in a few years
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.720]   to see whether or not the nicotine is working
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.600]   to stave off any kind of Alzheimer's or neurodegenerative
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.200]   or cognitive impairment that would come with age.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.040]   This gentleman is getting up in the years
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.200]   and seems quite sharp nonetheless,
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.160]   but then again was always exceedingly sharp.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.720]   The point is nicotine is a substance
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.640]   that can both promote cognitive function
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.820]   and under some conditions if taken to inappropriate
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.680]   or I should say to extreme dosages
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.740]   can also impair cognitive function.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.200]   So today we really need to have a nuanced conversation
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.200]   about nicotine.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.020]   One that includes some of the benefits,
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.380]   some of the drawbacks in particular for children,
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.680]   certainly for people that are pregnant,
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.840]   for people that have addictive tendencies
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.780]   and for people that have depression
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.340]   and any other kind of mood disorders.
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.480]   What I will tell you soon is that nicotine
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.620]   can be very powerful as a mood modulator.
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.440]   And many people who have tried to quit nicotine
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.440]   mainly through the form of smoking
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.360]   will find that their mood can drop substantially.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.120]   So nicotine does a lot of things in the brain and body.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.960]   And so I'd like to begin by talking about
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.960]   what exactly nicotine is
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.340]   and how it impacts your brain and body.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.540]   So what is nicotine and where is it found?
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.400]   Obviously nicotine is found in the tobacco plant,
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.680]   but nicotine is also found in nightshades.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.200]   That is tomatoes, eggplants and sweet peppers.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.240]   Although the concentrations of nicotine
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.100]   in tomatoes, eggplants and sweet peppers
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:15.040]   is vastly lower than it is in the tobacco plant.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.120]   You actually can also find nicotine in potatoes.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.800]   Now, why is nicotine present in potatoes and tomatoes
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.120]   and in the tobacco plant at all?
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.440]   Well, nicotine is a plant alkaloid.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.340]   We'll get into alkaloids a little bit later,
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.920]   but it is thought that these alkaloids evolved in plants
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.960]   as a way to prevent insects from eating them.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.200]   And without going into a lot of insect biology,
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.920]   the reason or the rationale behind this explanation
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.400]   is that nicotine is not only a substance in tobacco
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.320]   that people use or in the various medications
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.240]   that people use, but it's also used as a pesticide
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.640]   because it can dramatically disrupt
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.000]   the nervous system of insects.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.760]   It can render them infertile,
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.320]   which is not to say that it renders humans infertile.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.340]   I want to say again, it is not the case
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.320]   that nicotine renders humans infertile,
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.640]   but it can make certain insects infertile.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.760]   It can actually disrupt their motor function
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.960]   and their brain function.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.440]   And the reasons that it has such different effects
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.920]   on insects, in other words,
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.920]   it can kill them or prevent them from reproducing
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.520]   and therefore explains why plants probably evolved
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.620]   to have this plant alkaloid, nicotine.
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.160]   In humans, because of the differences
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.960]   in receptors for nicotine,
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.380]   where they're located in the types of receptors,
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.320]   the effects of nicotine on humans is quite a bit different.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.960]   And again, it does not cause infertility in humans.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.680]   Although I will talk a little bit later
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.380]   about some double-blind peer-reviewed studies
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:41.600]   conducted in humans that indicate that for instance,
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.240]   nicotine can reduce penile girth,
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.440]   that is the girth of the penis,
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.680]   and can lead to certain forms of sexual dysfunction.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.880]   And those changes are largely downstream of changes
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.000]   in blood flow and endothelial cell function.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.720]   Endothelial cells are the cells that make up blood vessels
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.940]   and other vascular type tissues within the brain and body.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.960]   So nicotine is found in these plants.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.260]   And what we can know for sure is that at some point
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.940]   in human evolution, somebody or some group of people,
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.320]   either, and here I'm completely guessing,
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.440]   it's a just so story,
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.920]   but someone or some group must have inhaled the smoke
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.680]   from the tobacco plant or put the dried leaves
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.000]   of the tobacco plant against some mucosal tissue,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.880]   any of the different mucosal linings of their body
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.120]   by which substances can pass through, that's right.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.440]   Any of the mucosal soft lining tissues of the body
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.160]   will allow certain substances,
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.940]   not all certain substances to pass in.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.760]   That's why people can put tobacco in their mouth
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.720]   and a certain amount of nicotine
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.640]   makes it into the bloodstream, put tobacco up their nose,
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.360]   certain amount of nicotine gets into the bloodstream.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.200]   I haven't heard of people putting tobacco
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.680]   in other orifices of their body containing mucosal tissue.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.720]   And I'm certainly not suggesting people do that,
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.820]   but you get the idea and how nicotine gets from these plants,
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.500]   these dried leaves into the bloodstream.
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:02.280]   Burning tobacco leads to a heat-induced change
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.000]   in the availability of nicotine.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.720]   And this is why smoking tobacco or vaping tobacco
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.200]   simply by heating it up allows the nicotine to be liberated
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.780]   and go into the bloodstream
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.320]   simply by inhaling it into the lungs.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.100]   We will get back to smoking of various kinds later,
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.600]   but right now let's just keep our attention
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.200]   on how nicotine is pulled from these plants
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.880]   and into the human body.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.480]   Now, whether by inhalation or whether or not
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.720]   by placing it in contact with the mucosal tissue of the mouth
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:36.000]   or other mucosal containing orifice of the body,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.360]   the nicotine then gets into the bloodstream.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.280]   And once it's in the bloodstream,
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.960]   it only exerts its effects
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.480]   because it binds to certain so-called nicotinic receptors.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.040]   Okay, so the nicotinic receptors
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.800]   are of the acetylcholinergic variety.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.920]   I know this is a lot to think about and a lot to hear
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.760]   if you haven't heard about this,
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.060]   but it's actually quite simple.
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.700]   Anyone can understand this.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:02.280]   Acetylcholin is a molecule, a chemical that is,
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.720]   that's released in the brain and body.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.640]   And when it binds to receptors,
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.640]   that is little parking spots on cells,
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.880]   it changes the way those cells behave.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.840]   Those cells can increase their activity
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.920]   and release other chemicals.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.220]   They can become electrically active.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.100]   They can do any number of different things.
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.760]   When we ingest nicotine, it gets into the bloodstream
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.620]   and eventually some of that will get into the brain
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.080]   and some of it gets into the body.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.620]   And in both of the brain and body,
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.700]   there are these so-called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:34.280]   Now the so-called family, and indeed they are a family,
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.840]   this is how we refer to groups of receptors
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.760]   of related design and genetic background, just like humans.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.600]   You have a family of these acetylcholine receptors
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.900]   that are of the nicotinic variety.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.880]   So, you know, maybe on one street in your neighborhood,
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.440]   you know the Joneses on another street,
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.740]   you know the Chows on another street.
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.960]   Well, in your body,
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.120]   you have the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.960]   and then you have the so-called
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.120]   muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.160]   Today, it's really simple.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.000]   Nicotine only binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.620]   and there are a bunch of different ones
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.160]   on a bunch of different tissues.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.940]   And the differences in those receptors
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.660]   dictate what sorts of effects
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.360]   the nicotine will have on those tissues.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.000]   So let's talk about what those effects are
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.480]   and let's do that by dividing the effects of nicotine
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.080]   into effects on the brain.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.620]   So everything from the neck up and on the body,
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.080]   the so-called central nervous system and the periphery.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.520]   Although I want to point out that your spinal cord
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.740]   is part of the central nervous system,
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.340]   so in fairness to the reality,
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.360]   your brain and spinal cord are all central nervous system,
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.880]   everything else is considered the periphery.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.900]   Now, there are a lot of different
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.700]   nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.260]   but for those of you that want to know,
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.740]   you have aficionados or if you're ultra curious about this,
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.520]   the main effects of nicotine in the brain
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.260]   are mediated by nicotine binding
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.760]   to the so-called alpha-4 beta-2 receptor,
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.100]   alpha-4 beta-2 receptor.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.520]   Even if you don't care about receptor subtypes,
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.640]   that's going to come up later
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:59.320]   when we discuss why nicotine suppresses appetite.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.640]   In fact, one of the major reasons
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.960]   why people don't want to quit smoking
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.520]   or they quit smoking or another form of ingesting nicotine
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.100]   and then they relapse, they go back to smoking
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.000]   or ingesting nicotine in some other way
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.800]   is because indeed nicotine will increase metabolism
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.200]   and reduce hunger in large part
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.840]   by binding to this alpha-4 beta-2 receptor
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.920]   in a particular area of the brain.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.060]   We're going to return to that in a little bit,
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.040]   but if you've ever heard that nicotine kills the appetite,
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.440]   indeed it does.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.080]   It's not the behavior of smoking itself,
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.700]   it's not because you always have a cigarette in your mouth
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.040]   that you're not eating more food,
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.220]   although I suppose that might be a minor effect.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.480]   There are direct effects of nicotine on both appetite,
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.920]   that is it reduces appetite,
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.700]   and direct effects on metabolism,
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.320]   that is it increases metabolism
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.560]   through its effects on some other areas of the brain and body
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.880]   we'll talk about in a moment.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.200]   And within the brain,
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.200]   nicotine binds to this alpha-4 beta-2 receptor
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.880]   in various locations in the brain.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.200]   And there are three and maybe a fourth
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.400]   that we'll talk about neurochemical effects of nicotine
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.520]   after you ingest it.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.920]   First things first, when you ingest nicotine
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.340]   by smoking nicotine containing tobacco,
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.840]   or if you place tobacco in contact with the mucosal lining
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.160]   of the nasal passages of the mouth,
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.360]   takes about two to 15 minutes
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.840]   for that nicotine to enter the bloodstream.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.840]   Smoking hits the bloodstream faster,
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.360]   vaping even faster, I should mention,
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.800]   for a variety of reasons,
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.120]   and placing tobacco directly in contact
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.760]   with the mucosal lining is going to be the slowest.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.960]   Now, as I mentioned before,
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.400]   nicotine gets into the bloodstream,
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.400]   and then because nicotine can pass
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.640]   through the so-called blood-brain barrier, the BBB,
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.040]   which is basically a fence around the brain,
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.320]   because it can pass through the blood-brain barrier,
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.520]   it's going to have very rapid effects on the brain
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.600]   in these four major categories
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.840]   of neurochemicals and neural circuits.
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.400]   The first of those categories,
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.080]   and this is a very important one,
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.640]   this is one that was brought up in the episode
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.080]   on dopamine motivation and drive,
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.200]   and I think not just all scientists,
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   but all human beings should know that within their brain,
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:05.200]   they have what is called the mesolimbic reward pathway.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.600]   The mesolimbic reward pathway,
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.320]   if you just want to call it the dopamine reward pathway,
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.040]   is, as the name suggests,
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.940]   a set of connections between a brain area
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.480]   called the ventral tegmental area.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.460]   You don't have to remember the names of these things,
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.740]   of course, but if you want to, that's fine too.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.160]   The ventral tegmental area, or VTA,
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.880]   connects to another area called the nucleus accumbens.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.400]   Now, here's what's very important.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.400]   Nicotine triggers the release of dopamine
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.640]   from the nucleus accumbens.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.720]   This is what gives nicotine its rewarding properties.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.100]   It increases motivation.
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.220]   It tends to give a not so subtle,
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.860]   but very transient increase in feelings of wellbeing
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.740]   and alertness and motivation,
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.760]   and that's because of the increase in dopamine
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:50.560]   caused by nicotine directly within the nucleus accumbens.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:55.260]   Nicotine also triggers the release of certain neurochemicals
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.500]   from the ventral tegmental area itself,
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.820]   and those impinge on nucleus accumbens
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.180]   and increase dopamine levels further.
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.560]   This is what makes the rewarding properties,
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.180]   or sometimes referred to as the reinforcing properties
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.700]   of nicotine, so powerful.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:13.080]   This is why so many billions of people ingest nicotine
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.100]   in one form or another.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.100]   It's also why nicotine is so hard to quit,
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.820]   because there's a potent increase in dopamine
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.080]   from multiple neural circuit pathways
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.300]   within this mesolimbic reward circuitry.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.020]   Now, within the mesolimbic reward circuitry,
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:29.940]   there's an interesting feature.
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.020]   There are accelerators that essentially
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.860]   push out more dopamine, get more dopamine released,
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.780]   and there are breaks of the so-called GABAergic variety.
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.920]   GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.040]   You don't need to know too much about it
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.620]   to just understand that nicotine both increases dopamine,
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:49.340]   but also decreases the activity of GABA.
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.720]   And so this is like pushing on the accelerator for dopamine,
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.660]   but also removing the break.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.900]   So there's a two-pronged effect of nicotine
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.260]   on reinforcement reward dopamine-related pathways,
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.940]   the feel-good motivation pathways,
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.400]   and that is an increase in dopamine
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.500]   and a decrease in GABA.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.860]   And again, that's all mediated
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.340]   through this mesolimbic reward pathway
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.260]   involving the ventral tegmental area
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.660]   and the nucleus accumbens.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.120]   So if you can conceptualize even just 5%
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.260]   of what I just told you,
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.540]   or even if you can just remember,
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.260]   nicotine increases dopamine,
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.620]   and that's why it feels so good,
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.660]   it makes you want more of it,
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.340]   you will have everything you need to know in mind
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:32.340]   in order to understand both why nicotine is so highly used
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:35.200]   and indeed abused, why it's so hard to quit,
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.740]   and that will point to avenues
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:39.080]   as to how to quit or reduce intake.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.160]   And it also points to how nicotine can actually be used
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.660]   in an antidepressant way should you choose,
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.180]   and we will talk about what the various criteria are
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.340]   for choosing that.
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:53.020]   But just understand nicotine increases motivation,
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.660]   it decreases negative feelings of mood,
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.420]   it increases positive feelings of mood and motivation.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.660]   Before we continue with today's discussion,
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.740]   I'd like to just briefly acknowledge our sponsor,
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.960]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.220]   Athletic Greens, AKA AG1,
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.680]   is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.740]   that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes.
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.460]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since way back in 2012,
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.900]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.500]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.440]   and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens twice a day
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.340]   is that it supplies total foundational coverage
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.740]   of my vitamin mineral needs
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.680]   and it supplies important nutrients that I need
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.240]   to support my gut microbiome.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.960]   The gut microbiome, as many of you know,
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.080]   supports the immune system.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.120]   It also supports the so-called gut-brain axis,
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.480]   which is vital for mood, for energy levels,
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.820]   for regulating focus, and many other features
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.300]   of our mental health and physical health
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.800]   that impact our daily performance and high performance
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.920]   in any endeavors we might be involved in.

[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.760]   to claim that special offer.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.440]   The second major effect that nicotine has in the brain
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.080]   is that it increases acetylcholine.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.520]   Acetylcholine is a neuromodulator that exists in you and me.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.520]   It is released from multiple sites in the brain.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:27.400]   And the two major sites are the nucleus basalis.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.760]   So these are a collection of neurons
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.140]   in the front and base of your brain
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.000]   and from some brain stem areas.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.980]   And there are a bunch of different ones back there
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.880]   in your brain stem, which is indeed in the back,
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.760]   that release acetylcholine.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.400]   That include the locus coeruleus as kind of a minor site,
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.300]   the pedunculopontine nucleus.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.720]   There are a bunch of these different areas,
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.200]   the parabigeminal nucleus.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.800]   There are a bunch of these things back there.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.280]   We don't have to go into all the names,
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.700]   but just understand that there are little pockets of neurons,
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.920]   nerve cells located in the front and the back
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.480]   and some extent in the middle of your brain,
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.400]   but really in the front and the back of your brain
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.280]   that can serve two major roles.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.960]   Here they are.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.520]   Acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.560]   leads to a sort of spotlighting or highlighting
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.780]   a particular neural circuits in the brain.
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.620]   What do I mean by this?
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.800]   Well, let's say you're working on a puzzle.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.920]   Let's say it's a cognitive puzzle.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.520]   Maybe you're doing a word puzzle.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.520]   Or nowadays I've heard of this wordle thing.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.000]   I'm on Twitter and people are always posting
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.880]   their wordle thing.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.880]   I have no idea what it is,
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.580]   but I'm guessing it's some sort of puzzle.
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.040]   I'm guessing it's like a crossword puzzle.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.800]   And here, if I'm wrong, I don't know, educate me.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.640]   Tell me what wordle is.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.960]   Somebody put it in the comments
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.180]   and tell me if I should play it or not.
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.020]   Here's the deal.
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:36.840]   When acetylcholine is released from nucleus basalis,
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.440]   the neurons are there in the base of the brain,
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.000]   but they extend axons,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.080]   which are like little wires elsewhere in the brain.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.000]   And when acetylcholine is released,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.680]   it tends to be released at particular locations in the brain
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.600]   that are associated with whatever activity
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.500]   we happen to be doing.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.340]   So if I'm doing wordle,
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.200]   here I'm talking about it as if I've ever done it,
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.000]   doing a crossword puzzle or wordle,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.240]   well, the neurons that were involved
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.560]   in trying to figure out the solution
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.900]   to that wordle or crossword puzzle are active.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.640]   And then acetylcholine is released from the little wires,
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.560]   the little endings of these cells in nucleus basalis.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.460]   And all of a sudden, those neural circuits get a boost.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.920]   They become more active.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.680]   And believe it or not,
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.640]   our ability to perform that crossword puzzle,
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.800]   or at least focus on that wordle or crossword puzzle
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.040]   gets enhanced.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.400]   It literally increases.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.760]   Our attention for that and not anything else is enhanced.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.840]   So it's literally like a neurochemical attentional spotlight.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.200]   Nicotine increases acetylcholine
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.440]   and thereby focusing concentration and mental performance,
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.020]   not by changing the neural circuits
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.760]   that are activated per se,
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.100]   but rather by making more acetylcholine available
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.560]   at those release sites.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.320]   So it's as if the spotlighter got more intense.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.360]   The highlighter is more intense than it would be otherwise.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.840]   And I should also mention
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.800]   because of the so-called pharmacokinetics,
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.920]   the time course in which nicotine has its effects,
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.400]   which are pretty short-lived.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.720]   Talk about those in a moment.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.320]   This enhancement in cognitive performance and attention
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.400]   is going to be very transient,
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.840]   probably on the order of about 30, maybe 45 minutes.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.980]   The half-life of nicotine,
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.200]   depending on how it's ingested
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.380]   and whether or not you have food in the gut
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.080]   and what else is in the bloodstream, et cetera,
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.480]   it's going to be anywhere from one to two hours.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.880]   But typically the effects of nicotine
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.000]   will come on in about two to 15 minutes,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:18.960]   as I mentioned before,
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.440]   and then will last anywhere from about 30 to 45 minutes.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.000]   This is why in the old days,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.420]   and still to some extent in certain areas of the world,
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.240]   but less so in the United States
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.080]   and certainly in Europe as well,
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.640]   we don't see quite as many people smoking cigarettes
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.860]   for reasons we can discuss later.
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.120]   But you would see these chain smokers
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.440]   who are trying to maintain constant levels of nicotine
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.960]   in their brain and bloodstream.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.580]   Now, perhaps they didn't know
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:46.320]   that nicotine has this one to two hour half-life,
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.700]   but they could sense, no doubt,
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.960]   the cognitive and the physical effects of nicotine,
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.840]   including this cognitive enhancement effect
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.240]   and highlighting of the neural circuits effect.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.600]   And they would notice they would smoke a cigarette
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.160]   and then for the next five to 45 minutes
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.120]   have heightened focus and then it would start to drop off.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.140]   So they smoke another cigarette.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:03.980]   So in other words,
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.320]   they're trying to maintain a constant level of nicotine
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.320]   for whatever activities they needed to perform.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.760]   Obviously chain smoking
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.560]   because of the terrible effects of smoking.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.780]   I'll talk about those terrible effects,
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.680]   but I'm sure you've heard of them before.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.640]   Cancer, depletion of just about every organ and body tissue
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.780]   to the point that it can actually be measured
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.680]   how many years of your life you're peeling off
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.340]   in terms of lifespan and health span by smoking.
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:31.360]   Well, the terrible effects of smoking are indisputable,
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:35.160]   but the positive effects of nicotine on this circuitry
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.780]   are part of the reason why people would chain smoke
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:38.960]   in the first place,
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.700]   rather than get one big peak of concentration and focus
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.520]   and then just let it disappear after 45 minutes.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.840]   Okay, so what we have is a scenario
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.540]   where dopamine is going up in the mesolimbic pathway.
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.380]   That's why smoking or ingesting nicotine in any other way
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.660]   feels good and makes us feel motivated.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.220]   And then the increase in acetylcholine,
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.580]   especially from nucleus basalis in the front of the brain
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.360]   is the reason why it can increase our ability
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.220]   to focus on particular types of endeavors,
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.820]   particular mental work that we're doing,
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.640]   or maybe even particular physical work.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.780]   Although I should mention anytime I'm pairing
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.800]   the words nicotine and physical work,
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.700]   it's obvious that because of the ways
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.200]   that smoking impairs lung function,
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.540]   those two things really run counter to one another.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.340]   In other words, if you are thinking about ingesting nicotine
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.380]   through smoking or vaping
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:25.140]   in order to improve physical performance,
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.400]   that's a terrible idea.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.400]   The logic isn't there
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.220]   and the health detriments are certainly there.
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:32.640]   The third neurochemical pathway that's strongly activated
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.060]   when nicotine is brought into the central nervous system,
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:39.300]   into the brain is epinephrine or in particular norepinephrine
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.600]   which is related to epinephrine.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.180]   Now, earlier I said epinephrine is the same as adrenaline.
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:44.280]   That's still true.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.280]   Norepinephrine is closely related to epinephrine.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.420]   And for today's discussion,
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.860]   we're going to use them interchangeably.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.160]   Although I realize as I say that,
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.100]   that the medical students and some biology students
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.860]   are probably going to have a minor seizure
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.060]   when I lump norepinephrine and epinephrine.
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.980]   I don't do that to be too much of a lumper.
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:01.820]   In science, we talk about lumpers and splitters.
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.040]   Lumpers are people that like to oversimplify a little bit.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.940]   Splitters are people that really like to detail.
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:07.860]   You'll see a lot of splitters on social media
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:08.700]   from time to time.
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.300]   They'll say, "Wait, you didn't mention
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.060]   the alpha-2 beta-6 receptor subunit."
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.580]   Okay, look, I get it.
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.100]   And I am all for having splitters in the room.
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.900]   But for sake of today's discussion
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.980]   and for ease of digestibility of some of this,
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.100]   just want to point out that norepinephrine, epinephrine,
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.340]   and adrenaline, I'm going to treat as a common pool
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.100]   of similar, in fact, very similar molecules
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.700]   that all have the same net effect,
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.200]   at least in the context of this discussion.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.340]   And that's to increase levels of alertness,
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.020]   energy, and arousal.
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.580]   And the way that nicotine accomplishes those increases
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.860]   in alertness and arousal and energy within the brain
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.620]   is by triggering the release of norepinephrine
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.380]   from a little cluster of neurons in the back of the brain
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:49.900]   called locus coeruleus, tiny cluster of neurons
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.580]   that offers up, or I should say has,
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.980]   because they're always there from birth,
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:58.040]   has these little wires, these axons that extend many,
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.780]   many places in the brain, not every place,
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.620]   but virtually every place and can sprinkler the brain
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:03.980]   with norepinephrine and essentially serve
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:07.260]   as a wake-up signal, elevating levels of energy.
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.020]   And when that combines with the acetylcholine
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.140]   from nucleus basalis,
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.020]   which causes attentional spotlighting,
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.500]   increases in concentration and focus,
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.300]   and with the feel-good properties of dopamine
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.620]   and the motivating properties of dopamine released
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.700]   from the mesolimbic reward pathway,
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.580]   now you can start to get a picture
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:30.140]   of why nicotine is such a powerful molecule.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.020]   It's making people feel motivated and good.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.540]   It's making people feel focused
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.300]   and it makes people feel alert
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.460]   when they would otherwise feel a little bit sleepy.
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.420]   So this is a really powerful compound.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.940]   In fact, going back to our earlier discussion about focus
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.800]   and some tools for focus, and I encourage you,
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.540]   if you're interested to please check out the episode
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.740]   on focus, there are a number of different tools
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.660]   and protocols there to increase focus,
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:55.460]   but here we're talking about one molecule,
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:59.180]   nicotine found in plants like tomatoes and potatoes
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:02.420]   and the tobacco plant, and it can be synthesized
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.780]   in a laboratory and ingested through a patch or a gum
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:09.440]   or even a pill or a toothpick dipped in nicotine.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.980]   One molecule that can trigger activation
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:16.540]   of all the circuits for focus and motivation
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:19.100]   in one fell swoop.
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.660]   That is remarkable.
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.140]   That is absolutely remarkable.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.060]   And here we haven't even touched
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.160]   on some of the psychological components of focus, right?
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.600]   Whether or not we're interested in something,
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.860]   whether or not we're excited about it or not.
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.340]   This is a very, very powerful system.
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:34.260]   So powerful, in fact, that I think we can really place
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:38.620]   nicotine right up there at the top, right next to caffeine
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:42.780]   as the molecule that has fundamentally changed
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.760]   human evolution, human consciousness, and human experience.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.340]   Even if you're somebody who's never ingested nicotine,
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.780]   this absolutely has to be true
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.700]   because you have these nicotinic receptors,
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.540]   which is to say that acetylcholine that's naturally released
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:58.900]   without any external trigger within your brain and body,
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.140]   or I should say without any trigger from nicotine
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.420]   in particular, is binding these
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.420]   nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:07.700]   and is creating these effects in your brain and body.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.460]   It's just absolutely staggering.
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.180]   Now, earlier I mentioned the appetite suppressing
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.540]   and indeed metabolism increasing effects of nicotine.
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.180]   And while that's a fairly niche component
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.540]   of what nicotine does, I mean, it's an important one,
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.260]   but it's not the major reason
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.260]   why most people consume nicotine.
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.920]   I'd like to take a moment and talk about that now
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.900]   because we are in the brain and we're talking
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.500]   about the effects of nicotine in the brain.
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.220]   And so it seems to me the appropriate time
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.120]   to talk about this.
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.500]   Now we can have this conversation about nicotine
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.540]   and appetite and metabolism in a very simple
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.020]   and straightforward way.
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.900]   If you'd like to learn more about the biology
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.180]   of metabolism and appetite
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.180]   and how those things are mediated by neural components.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.180]   So not just stuff like your liver, et cetera,
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.220]   we have episodes on that,
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:52.140]   but really the neural components of hunger and appetite.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.500]   I encourage you to check out our episode
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.260]   on hunger and appetite.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.180]   But in that episode, we had a discussion
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.760]   and it's one that I'll just briefly summarize now
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.300]   that you have a collection of neurons
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.660]   that sits right above the roof of your mouth or so
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.060]   called the hypothalamus.
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.540]   Hypo means below and thalamus is right above it,
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:09.500]   hypothalamus.
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.660]   So the small collection of neurons in the hypothalamus
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.520]   do a number of different things related to sex behavior,
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:19.060]   aggression, mediating the temperature of your body, et cetera,
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:22.100]   but also appetite and suppressing appetite.
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.220]   And within the hypothalamus,
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:26.120]   there's a compact collection of these little neurons,
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.980]   which are referred to as the POMC, P-O-M-C neurons.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:29.940]   And the name comes from the fact
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:31.220]   that they express certain peptides
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.720]   and we won't get into that now,
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.020]   but the POMC neurons have a very profound impact
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.620]   on whether or not you feel hungry
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.980]   or whether or not you do not feel hungry,
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:43.380]   whether or not your appetite is suppressed.
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.540]   It turns out that when nicotine gets into the bloodstream
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.840]   and then into the brain,
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:51.740]   some of that nicotine binds to nicotinic alpha-4 beta-2
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.820]   containing nicotinic receptors.
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.180]   Again, these subunits are receptors,
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:56.340]   but basically the nicotine binds
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.020]   to one of those parking spots, parks there.
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.900]   And as a consequence, these POMC, P-O-M-C neurons
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.400]   increase their electrical activity
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.680]   and appetite is suppressed.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.540]   And that's because the POMC neurons have outputs
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.560]   to various areas of the brain and body
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.940]   controlling everything from how full we feel
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:17.340]   to whether or not our blood sugar goes up or down,
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.980]   which can impact our hunger.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.320]   And believe it or not, whether or not we have a tendency
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:24.700]   to want to move the jaw of our mouth in order to chew food.
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.180]   Yes, believe it or not, the neural circuitry associated
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.620]   with appetite and suppression of appetite
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.660]   actually dictates whether or not you prefer to,
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:35.460]   or I should say are more biased or less biased
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:38.260]   to moving your mouth, that is chewing,
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.660]   which makes perfect sense when you hear it, right?
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:44.820]   One way to suppress appetite is to sew the jaw shut neurally,
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.060]   or at least make it less likely to open your mouth
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.660]   and put food in it.
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.180]   Actually, that reminds me of a story.
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.380]   I'll just interrupt myself to tell a brief story.
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.580]   That there's a famous Nobel Laureate who won
[00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:57.060]   the Nobel Prize for something totally distant from appetite,
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:00.540]   but once turned to a friend of mine at a meeting and said,
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:05.540]   I discovered the biological mechanism for losing weight.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.720]   And my friend said, well, of course, it's a, you know,
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.340]   ingest fewer calories than you burn, right?
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.260]   Calories in, calories out.
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:13.920]   Fundamental rule of thermodynamics
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.180]   and basically the fundamental rule of weight loss,
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.100]   weight gain, or weight maintenance.
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:22.020]   And he said, no, it's actually the gene that controls
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.900]   whether or not you open your mouth.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.800]   Now he was making a very nerdy joke.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.520]   So if you didn't register that as a joke,
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.900]   that's about as funny as neuroscience or biology jokes get.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:31.780]   There are a couple of funnier ones,
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.620]   but that one's kind of considered on the funnier side.
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:36.480]   So this is why we're not considered comedians.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:41.480]   But the point of the matter is that whether or not you crave
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:45.040]   or desire or impulsively want to put things in your mouth
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.360]   and chew it will actually dictate
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.740]   how many calories that you eat.
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.460]   And so I find it remarkable and indeed important to know
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.520]   that these POMC neurons are actually inhibiting the opening
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.140]   and the movement of the mouth for chewing.
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.220]   So when we smoke or when we ingest nicotine
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.760]   in any other way, you activate these POMC neurons,
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.900]   you suppress appetite, but in part, you do that
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.280]   by actually limiting the impulse to chew.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.900]   Incredible, at least to me.
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.100]   Now, in addition to limiting appetite
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:11.340]   by changing one's desire to ingest food and chew it
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.420]   and actual craving of food
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.380]   by regulation of blood sugar, et cetera,
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.500]   there do seem to be some quite direct effects
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:21.180]   of nicotine on metabolism.
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.300]   And the effects on metabolism aren't enormous.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:27.220]   These are increases in metabolism that are about 2%
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:30.340]   up to about 5%, but I want to emphasize
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:33.900]   that those are transient increases in metabolism.
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.660]   Nonetheless, people that quit smoking
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.560]   often find that their appetite goes up.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.640]   They sometimes gain weight, they sometimes do not,
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.420]   depending on whether or not they offset
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:45.060]   that increase in appetite with increased physical exercise
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.300]   or with decreased food intake in other ways.
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.040]   But there does seem to be this direct effect
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.060]   of ingesting nicotine on metabolism,
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.460]   which I find is interesting
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:53.900]   because if you look in the literature,
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:57.020]   one of the reasons why people are reluctant
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:00.500]   to quit ingesting nicotine, if for instance,
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:04.000]   they want to quit using the delivery device
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.280]   to nicotine that's causing such problems for their health,
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.060]   like smoking or vaping,
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:11.340]   or whether or not they find themselves quote unquote
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:15.440]   addicted to or have the habit of ingesting nicotine,
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:19.060]   in part that's likely due to be the dopamine effects, right?
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.140]   Because dopamine is highly reinforcing and rewarding.
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.340]   It feels good, so people want to do more of it.
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.540]   But it's also that for many people,
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.140]   and here the data really points to the fact
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.620]   that a lot of the younger female smokers
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:32.540]   or younger female vapers,
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.180]   or when I say that, of course,
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:38.840]   I mean younger females that vape are doing that
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.260]   because they like the appetite suppressing effects,
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.300]   which of course opens up an entire conversation
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.260]   about the sociology of body imagery, et cetera,
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:47.940]   a topic for a future podcast.
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.940]   Okay, so nicotine has certain effects on the brain
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.340]   by virtue of the fact that nicotine binds
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.360]   these nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.060]   and those receptors are found on some,
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:00.180]   but not all neural circuits within the brain.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.980]   And we talked about some of them already,
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:04.340]   mesolimbic, the POMC neurons, et cetera.
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.880]   Now, when we ingest nicotine,
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.660]   it goes from the bloodstream to all the tissues
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.740]   and organs of the body.
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.920]   How does it do that, right?
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.760]   I mean, amazing.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.600]   It can pass to everything, the brain, the body.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:19.020]   It does that because nicotine is fat soluble.
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:20.860]   And now when anytime people hear the word fat,
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:23.660]   they tend to think about body fat, subcutaneous fat,
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.820]   or maybe they think about dietary fat.
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:27.780]   What I mean by fat soluble in the context
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:31.540]   of nicotine being fat soluble is that the cells
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:35.620]   of your body have an outer layer, so-called outer membrane,
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.760]   and it's made up of lipid, of fat,
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.820]   very particular types of lipids, in fact.
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:42.860]   Nicotine has this remarkable ability
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:46.640]   to move through that fatty tissue.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.320]   Not all molecules have that ability, but nicotine does.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.180]   So it can move relatively freely through the brain and body
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:56.200]   and relatively freely from outside of cells,
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.240]   extracellular space to intracellular space.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.380]   So it can get into cells.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:01.260]   It can do that with the brain.
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:02.300]   We talked about those effects,
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:04.180]   and it can do that within the body.
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.260]   Now, anytime we're talking about the body,
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.780]   we can be talking about any number of things,
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.060]   but today I'm going to refer to the periphery
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.820]   and the body in more or less the same way,
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:15.700]   but keep in mind in the back of your head, pun intended,
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:20.100]   you have your brain, your eyes, and the spinal cord,
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.740]   and those three things make up your central nervous system.
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.700]   The peripheral nervous system and the periphery,
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.100]   which is the rest of your body,
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.860]   that contain your organs and so forth
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:29.540]   outside of the nervous system,
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.700]   things like your liver and your stomach, et cetera,
[00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.540]   that's what we're going to talk about now,
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:36.220]   because nicotine has profound effects
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:38.760]   on the organs of the body that are separate from,
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.540]   but that occur in parallel at the same time
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:44.080]   as the effects of nicotine on the brain.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.040]   So let's talk about what some of those effects are.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.740]   When nicotine makes it into the bloodstream,
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:50.100]   again, within two to 15 minutes of ingesting it,
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:51.740]   depending on the delivery device,
[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:55.620]   your heart rate will increase,
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:57.540]   blood pressure will increase,
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:00.100]   and the contractibility of the heart tissue
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.880]   will actually increase.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.740]   So what that essentially speaks to
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.180]   is an increase in so-called sympathetic tone.
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.660]   And when I say that, I don't mean an increase in sympathy
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.440]   for others of the emotional sort.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.700]   What I mean is an increase in the sympathetic activity
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.020]   of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system,
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:21.540]   which is a real mouthful and mindful of ideas,
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.760]   but all you need to know is that it's a generalized system
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:28.600]   that increases levels of alertness and physical readiness.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.820]   So it makes you ready for action,
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.520]   makes you ready for thought.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.300]   It's balanced by a whole other system
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.180]   called the parasympathetic nervous system,
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:38.040]   which is basically the so-called rest and digest system,
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.600]   which is a system of neurons and organs, et cetera,
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.060]   that put your body and your brain into a state
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.180]   of not being able to think clearly,
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:47.180]   to digest and to fall asleep, okay?
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.620]   So nicotine increases heart rate,
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:51.560]   blood pressure and contractibility of the heart.
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:54.540]   So it's going to cause more blood flow in theory,
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:58.020]   although it also tends to constrict blood vessels
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:59.660]   in many locations in the body.
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:03.080]   This explains the decrease in penile girth effect
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.780]   of nicotine, in particular nicotine ingested
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:07.300]   by smoking or vaping.
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:11.540]   That's right, smoking and vaping reduces penis size
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:14.740]   and also will have damaging effects
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:18.140]   on the blood lining endothelial tissue.
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:20.740]   So over time, it actually is impairing blood's ability
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:23.240]   to get to the penis chronically,
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.180]   as well as to other organs of the body.
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:27.800]   But when people ingest nicotine acutely,
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.260]   and let's say they do that by Nicorette patch
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.420]   or by toothpick dipped in nicotine,
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.460]   it will have some of these same effects,
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:37.420]   but when not smoking tobacco,
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:39.260]   when bringing nicotine into the bloodstream
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:40.800]   through other mechanisms,
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.580]   many, if not all of the disruption
[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:46.000]   of the endothelial cell function can be bypassed.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.340]   But the effects on penile girth,
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:52.040]   the effects on reducing blood flow to various tissues
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:55.340]   is still present during the effects of nicotine,
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:57.520]   which as I mentioned, last about one to two hours.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:59.200]   The half-life is about one to two hours,
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.780]   depending on a number of factors.
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.120]   Not interesting for today's discussion.
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.440]   So when nicotine gets into the bloodstream,
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.840]   it's making us more alert.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.780]   It's preparing our body for readiness.
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:10.220]   The heart is pumping harder.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.080]   Epinephrine, that is adrenaline,
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.740]   is released from the adrenal glands,
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:16.820]   which ride atop our kidneys.
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:20.700]   So everything is pointed toward creating more readiness
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:22.860]   to move, more readiness to think.
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.260]   And again, this is happening in parallel
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.180]   with all the effects of neurochemistry
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:27.160]   that are happening with the brain
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.700]   that we talked about a few minutes ago.
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.420]   Now what's interesting about nicotine
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.460]   is that while it causes this global increase in readiness
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:37.180]   and alertness and attention and mood, et cetera,
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:42.020]   it also has the effect of somewhat relaxing skeletal muscle.
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:43.480]   Now that might seem counterintuitive
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.460]   to those of you out there
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:46.380]   that already know what I'm about to tell
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:49.520]   the rest of you who didn't know it previously,
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:53.220]   that your muscles are able to contract
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:56.500]   because of the effects of acetylcholine
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:59.660]   released from neurons in your spinal cord
[00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:02.420]   that spit out acetylcholine onto the muscle
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.260]   and bind to what?
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.160]   Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.820]   Put into plain English,
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:10.500]   nicotinic receptors are also the ways
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.700]   in which your muscles can get activated.
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.260]   So therefore, why would it be that increasing nicotine
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:17.780]   would cause relaxation of the muscles?
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:19.900]   And that has to do with some of the neural circuits
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.340]   that are upstream of the muscles
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:22.480]   and it has to do with a little bit
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:24.820]   of how the autonomic nervous system is arranged
[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:26.500]   in terms of which receptors go where.
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:30.100]   A topic and kind of rabbit hole of conversation
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:31.340]   far too deep for right now,
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:32.900]   at least in the context of this already
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.900]   somewhat detailed discussion of the effects of nicotine.
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.780]   But if we were to zoom out
[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:39.760]   and just think about the effects of nicotine,
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.480]   we now have a very clear picture.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.520]   Reward pathways are turned on.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.680]   Attention is turned on.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.560]   Alertness is turned on.
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.920]   You feel better than you felt a few minutes ago.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.560]   Your blood pressure is up.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.560]   Your heart rate is up.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:59.440]   Your preparedness for thinking is elevated as well.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:02.560]   And yet your body is somewhat relaxed.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:06.040]   That's a very interesting state of mind and body.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:11.040]   Interesting because it's somewhat ideal for cognitive work.
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.560]   Like if you were going to sit down and work on a book
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:14.400]   or you're going to sit down
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.300]   and try and figure out a hard math problem,
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:17.340]   or you're going to write a letter
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:19.080]   that's been really challenging for you to write,
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.700]   or maybe that you're really excited to write,
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:24.020]   but that you've been slow to get out the door
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:24.860]   for whatever reason here,
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:27.480]   I'm talking about my own habits of procrastination.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.480]   Well, that state of being very alert
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:32.360]   but your body being relaxed is almost,
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:36.300]   if not the optimal state for getting mental work done.
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.240]   Because if you're feeling agitated in your body
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.480]   and you want to physically move your body,
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.760]   it's very hard to do cognitive work,
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:42.060]   at least the sorts of cognitive work
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:45.180]   that involve typing or writing or these sorts of things.
[00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:48.320]   It's also the exact opposite of the optimal state
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:49.640]   for physical performance,
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:53.480]   which is one of, yes, also alertness.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.700]   Yes, also motivation and elevated mood.
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:59.400]   That's all wonderful stuff to have in mind, literally,
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.880]   when you are exercising or competing in sport
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.440]   or something of that sort.
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.600]   But under those conditions,
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:08.160]   you really also want to have a fast reaction time,
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.960]   a low latency for muscle activation
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.520]   so that you can make coordinated muscle movements
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.920]   in the ways that you need to,
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:15.680]   which is of course what's required of physical endeavors.
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.680]   That tells us a few things.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.380]   First of all, it tells us that nicotine
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:21.480]   is going to be generally a bad idea
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.920]   for a pre-workout tool
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.340]   or for enhancing physical performance.
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:31.360]   However, it's apt to be, and in fact is,
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:34.420]   an excellent tool for enhancing cognitive ability.
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:36.400]   And of course, that triggers my mind
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:37.560]   to return to the anecdote
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:39.400]   about my Nobel Prize winning colleague
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.920]   who ingests nicotine by way of nicotine-containing gum
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.440]   in order to increase levels of cognitive focus,
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.520]   certainly not for going out and playing sport.
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:50.940]   In fact, despite the fact that he is very, very tall,
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:55.880]   he often points to himself in an appropriately funny way
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.720]   that despite being on the basketball team of his high school,
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:00.960]   he's probably the worst player that ever existed
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.800]   and they only positioned him there because of his height.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.040]   And I guess his head was designed to prevent balls
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.320]   from entering the basket.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:10.960]   In any event, nicotine does seem to be very good
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:14.440]   at enhancing cognitive function, at least in the short term,
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.680]   which is not to say that it isn't without its side effects,
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.960]   which we will talk about.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:19.000]   And again, those are side effects
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.920]   that are independent of smoking or vaping
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.480]   or other forms of ingesting nicotine.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:27.500]   For instance, dipping or chewing tobacco
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:30.640]   is known to cause a 50-fold, yes, five-zero,
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:34.560]   50-fold increase in mouth cancers, things like leukoplakia,
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.420]   and just generally is terrible for your health.
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.960]   I'm sorry to break it to you, but if you're dipping
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.480]   or you're using snuff or things of that sort,
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.320]   certainly I'm not going to tell people what to do.
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.440]   That's not my role in life,
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.720]   but you are dramatically increasing the probability
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.800]   of an oral cancer or of a mucosal lining cancer
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.100]   of some sort.
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:56.040]   So it's not just that smoking and vaping
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:56.880]   are bad for your health.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.660]   These other forms of delivery from nicotine
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:00.080]   can be bad for your health as well.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:01.520]   And whether or not ingesting nicotine
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.400]   by way of nicotine-containing gum or patch
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:07.800]   or toothpick or other method is dangerous.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:10.400]   For other reasons is a discussion that's important.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.760]   Right now, it appears that provided
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.720]   the dosages are kept reasonable,
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.820]   and we'll talk about what reasonable means a little later,
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:21.640]   and the frequency is kept relatively low,
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:24.360]   so not relying on these things constantly,
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.080]   there may in fact be some benefit
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.700]   to ingesting nicotine from time to time,
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:32.360]   provided that you are not still developing your brain.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:34.440]   Now, in reality, neuroplasticity goes on
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:35.960]   throughout the lifetime.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.860]   Your life is actually one long developmental arc.
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:40.240]   It's not like development occurs and then stops.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.160]   But certainly for people before puberty, during puberty,
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:47.200]   and probably for the next 15 to 20 years after puberty,
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.800]   avoiding nicotine is probably a good idea.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:52.200]   Now, of course, development is your entire life.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.780]   It's not like development starts and then ends,
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:58.120]   but certainly for people that are 25 years old or younger,
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.800]   ingesting nicotine as a way to enhance cognitive function
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.400]   is probably not the best idea.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:05.060]   And certainly, please, for those of you
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:07.360]   that are 15 years old or younger,
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.120]   ingesting nicotine in any form,
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.560]   unless it's prescribed by your doctor
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:13.160]   for a very specific clinical reason,
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:15.240]   to me seems just like a terrible idea
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:17.000]   based on all the data that I've read.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.720]   And the reason for that is it's going to create a scenario
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.740]   of nicotine dependence in order to achieve
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:24.320]   heightened levels of mood and alertness, et cetera.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.240]   And that's bad.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:26.500]   And what we're effectively talking about
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.420]   is an addiction for nicotine directly,
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:30.720]   not necessarily the delivery device method
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:33.200]   like smoking or vaping, although it could pull that in
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.760]   as an addictive or habit-forming behavior as well.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.800]   But you want to let your neural circuits develop
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:41.000]   to the point where, again, unless there's a clinical need
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.880]   for a prescribed drug from a licensed physician
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.100]   or psychiatrist, et cetera, that you're not relying
[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:48.580]   on chemical enhancement of these circuits.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:53.440]   For people who are 25 years or older,
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:54.800]   and again, that's not a strict cutoff,
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.680]   but roughly 25 years or older,
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:00.120]   but for those of you that are thinking about using nicotine
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:03.000]   to enhance cognitive function as adults
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.040]   and your brain development is slowing down, right?
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.380]   Never ceases, but it's slowing down or has slowed down
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:12.120]   to the point where we would say developmental plasticity
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.280]   is largely over and you're now operating
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:17.880]   in the context of adult neuroplasticity.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.000]   Well, in that case, there may be instances
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.020]   in which increasing acetylcholine, dopamine, et cetera,
[00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:26.940]   by way of nicotine ingestion might be a good idea,
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.880]   but certainly not by smoking, vaping,
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.500]   or by direct contact of tobacco
[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.140]   to the mucosal lining tissue of the mouth or nose,
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:35.660]   so-called dipping or snuffing.
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.000]   For the last 20 minutes or so,
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.340]   we've been talking about the biology
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:40.780]   of nicotine specifically, how it impacts the brain,
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:42.960]   how it impacts the body, why it feels so good,
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.480]   why it can enhance focus.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:48.820]   And we've largely set aside smoking, vaping,
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:52.640]   dipping tobacco, and snuffing, and the negative effects
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:55.560]   that those all have on mental and physical health.
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:56.880]   Working down from the top of the head
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:00.080]   to the bottom of the feet, we can say that smoking,
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:02.920]   vaping, dipping, and snuffing
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:05.380]   negatively impact every organ and tissue system
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:08.200]   and cell of the body by virtue of the fact
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.360]   that they all damage the endothelial cells.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.080]   Again, the endothelial cells are the cells
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:14.680]   that make up the vasculature,
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:18.120]   which delivers blood and other nutrients
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:21.040]   to all the cells and organs and tissues of the body.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.760]   And those endothelial cells are strongly
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.580]   and negatively impacted by all of the practices
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:28.280]   that I just described.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.000]   Now, the way that that happens varies a little bit
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.040]   from each one to the next.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.840]   For instance, it has been estimated
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.520]   that cigarettes contain anywhere
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:38.400]   from 4,000 to 7,000 toxins.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.380]   Now, the word toxins is a real buzzword these days.
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.720]   You hear about detoxes and toxins.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:46.880]   But more specifically, we know that it contains carcinogens.
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:49.360]   These are cancer-promoting compounds.
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:52.120]   For instance, we know that the tar in cigarettes,
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.720]   even low-tar cigarettes,
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.700]   as well as the ammonia within cigarettes,
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:58.780]   as well as the formaldehyde contained within cigarettes,
[00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:00.840]   as well as the carbon dioxide that's generated
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:04.000]   from smoking those cigarettes are all carcinogens.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.440]   Carbon dioxide also has the negative effect
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.760]   of depleting the amount of oxygen that's delivered
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.440]   to any and all of our tissues
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:14.000]   by way of the impact of carbon dioxide,
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.640]   binding hemoglobin and preventing hemoglobin
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.440]   from delivering oxygen to the tissues of the body.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:23.440]   So while there may be 4,000 or 4,500 or 7,000 toxins,
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.600]   depending on which cigarette,
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.520]   which papers they happen to be rolled in,
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.320]   whether or not they're filtered or non-filtered,
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.880]   the type of tobacco, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:33.440]   there are a tremendous number of toxins
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.820]   and there are some very potent carcinogens
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:37.860]   within that long list of toxins.
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:41.060]   Again, ammonia, tar, formaldehyde, and carbon dioxide
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.640]   being the most potent of those carcinogens.
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.640]   Now, the fact that there are carcinogens in cigarettes
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.080]   sometimes lead cigarette smokers,
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.960]   and particularly the cigarette smokers
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.340]   that have the hardest time quitting
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.320]   or that enjoy their cigarettes the most from saying,
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.320]   "Well, listen, everything is a carcinogen,"
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.160]   or, "Everything kills you."
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.840]   Well, certainly that's not a true statement.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.480]   And while there are other carcinogens in the environment,
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:04.360]   so environmental hazards like solvents,
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.100]   and even if you work in a laboratory, for instance,
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:09.860]   we use in the laboratory DNA intercalating dyes.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:11.400]   These are literally dyes that allow us
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.180]   to see the DNA structure of cells
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:14.520]   and see the proteins they make
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.160]   and see the RNAs they make.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.480]   And it's very important to wear gloves
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.360]   when you work with those things,
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.440]   because as the name suggests, they intercalate,
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.560]   they actually get in between the strands of DNA
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.660]   and separate them.
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:26.160]   They are mutagens, they mutate DNA.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.820]   They are often carcinogens as well.
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:29.120]   So we have them in our laboratory,
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.400]   but we take certain precautions
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.560]   to not have them negatively impact our health,
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.100]   safety protocols, and so on.
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:38.140]   We hear that there are carcinogens in car exhaust
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:41.040]   and bus exhaust and in all sorts of things like pesticides,
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.260]   and that's all true.
[01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:44.960]   So in the argument of probabilities, one would say,
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:47.440]   "Well, if there are all these other carcinogens
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.980]   in the environment, why would you compound
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:52.960]   their carcinogenic effect by smoking or vaping
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.460]   or dipping or snuffing?"
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:56.360]   But that usually doesn't get people to quit smoking
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.860]   or doing those things because of the powerful
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:00.140]   reinforcing effects of nicotine itself.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:02.920]   So again, nicotine is the reinforcing element
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.000]   by way of triggering that dopamine reinforcement pathway,
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.700]   the mesolimbic reward pathway.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:11.380]   And of course, there are all the other additional effects
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.500]   of increased focus, such as increased ability
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.280]   to pay attention to work or to others
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.560]   that lead to other rewards.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.960]   And so then it becomes a situation of compounding rewards.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.460]   So it's not really about the cigarette,
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.380]   it's about the nicotine,
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.580]   and it's not really about the nicotine,
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:25.580]   it's about the dopamine that the nicotine evokes.
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.180]   And then it's not really about the dopamine
[01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:30.000]   that the nicotine evokes directly per se,
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.800]   but also about all the positive effects
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.500]   that that increased dopamine results in.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.140]   So we can easily circle back to the negative effects
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:40.180]   of smoking, vaping, dipping, and snuffing,
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:43.540]   and say the endothelial cells are disrupted.
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:46.060]   The endothelial cells are involved in delivery of blood
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:48.300]   and other nutrients to every tissue of the body,
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:51.020]   and smoking, vaping, dipping, and snuffing
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.540]   contain carcinogens, which are cancer promoting.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:55.780]   And because the epidemiological studies are out there,
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:58.040]   we can actually arrive at some very clear numbers
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.400]   as to how much life one will lose
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:04.120]   from ingesting nicotine by way
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.160]   of those four delivery devices,
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.380]   or I should say any one of those four delivery devices.
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:11.260]   Although I should also mention that many people
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:13.280]   who are vaping are also smoking cigarettes,
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.740]   this is becoming increasingly common.
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.820]   A lot of people are using vaping in one context
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:18.000]   and cigarettes in another,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.060]   dipping in one context, vaping in another.
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:23.160]   But even for those that only smoke, or only vapor,
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.440]   only dip, or only snuff,
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:30.020]   the negative effects are dramatic and calculable.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:32.900]   So it is thought that for every pack of cigarettes
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:35.560]   consumed per day, so you could average that out
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.940]   if you're a two a day cigarette smoker,
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:41.500]   or a pack a day cigarette smoker, or two pack a day,
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.760]   for every pack of cigarettes smoked per day,
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.720]   we can reliably estimate a 14 year reduction in lifespan.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.120]   So cigarettes are literally peeling years off your life.
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.000]   Now, because of the way that the brain works
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.480]   and the way that human beings anticipate the future
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:03.800]   and can be grounded both in the present and the future,
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.920]   or the present and the past,
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.160]   that's just how the mind works, right?
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.500]   That's why we can think about the future,
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.500]   but also realize where we are in time and space today.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.800]   Because of that, many people will say,
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:15.040]   well, I enjoy cigarettes, or I enjoy vaping,
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.560]   and so at least while I'm here, I'm enjoying it.
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:19.640]   And that's because the dopamine system is not very good
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:22.720]   at understanding opportunity costs.
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:25.480]   That is what we would be doing in those 14 years,
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.740]   and what we would be enjoying,
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.440]   and the enrichment that we would get
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.680]   if we were to live into those 14 years.
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:33.720]   So at some level, the smoker, the vapor is being rational
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.720]   when they say, yeah, but I enjoy this.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:39.240]   And so the years lost, I can't really register that
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.080]   because it's hard to register what you don't have
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.040]   and what you've never had, right?
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:46.480]   On the other hand, we can also point to the statistic
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.000]   that there is this 50-fold increase
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.240]   in mouth cancers from dipping,
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.400]   and there are nasal cancers as well
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.280]   that are greatly increased by snuffing,
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:01.280]   and from smoking, and now we know based on data from vaping,
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:05.520]   that the endothelial cell damage and the direct effects
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.320]   of damage to the lungs from TARS,
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.740]   and even if people are vaping,
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:11.920]   which tends to have lower TARS than do cigarettes,
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.640]   even for people that are vaping,
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:17.080]   greatly increased probability of stroke,
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.760]   of peripheral vascular disease.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.240]   So this is peripheral pain because remember,
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.940]   blood is delivering not just blood, but other nutrients,
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:26.300]   and it's clearing things out from tissues.
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:29.440]   So there's an accumulation of literally toxins and debris
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.660]   that cells generate all the time, which is healthy,
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:35.300]   but then normally is cleared away by the endothelial cells
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:38.120]   and by other cell types of the immune system.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.600]   That's all increased in people
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.700]   that engage in these nicotine delivery device behaviors.
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:47.120]   Rates of heart attack, rates of stroke,
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.920]   rates of cognitive decline are all increased.
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.000]   Now you might say cognitive decline,
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.120]   I thought that nicotine increases the likelihood
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.160]   that we can maintain healthy neuronal function
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.480]   and cognitive capacity.
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:00.120]   It might even increase cognitive capacity in a potent way
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.880]   in the short term, and indeed it does.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:05.460]   However, cigarette smoking and vaping
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:10.080]   are now known to dramatically decrease cognitive function
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.320]   because one of the key things about the brain
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:15.040]   is that it is the most metabolically demanding organ,
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.640]   which means it consumes a lot of glucose,
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.800]   or even if you're ketogenic, you need ketones.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.640]   You need nutrients getting to the neurons
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.760]   and other cell types of the brain and nervous system
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.400]   in order for it to function properly.
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.280]   And when you disrupt the vasculature
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.700]   through this endothelial cell dysfunction,
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:30.200]   you got things like interstitial,
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.420]   which just means in the spaces between dysfunction.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.560]   So it's not just beating up the endothelial cells themselves,
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.160]   but the spaces between the cells is being disrupted.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.920]   There's a lot of debris that accumulates there.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.520]   And as a consequence,
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.360]   the brain just simply will not function as well.
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.280]   So you start getting short-term memory lapses,
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.800]   you start getting working memory lapses.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.280]   Working memory is a sort of memory,
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.500]   if someone tells you their seven digit phone number,
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.400]   typically nowadays people just share their info,
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.720]   but seven digit phone number or a sequence of numbers
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.720]   or an address and your inability to remember that.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.140]   So you're walking back to the kitchen sink
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.440]   and you can't remember what you were trying to remember
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.540]   just a short moment ago, that's working memory.
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:07.320]   Working memory suffers long-term memory,
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:10.480]   projective or interrogating memories into the future.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:13.560]   How can you remember things in the future
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.440]   that haven't occurred yet?
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:17.400]   Well, this is more of a memory for future plans
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.680]   or ideas and planning for things that are to come.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:23.240]   So what we can very reliably say is that currently
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.760]   more than 1 billion, billion,
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.240]   more than 1 billion people consume tobacco
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.940]   in order to get their nicotine,
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:34.040]   'cause that's really the reinforcing element within tobacco.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.360]   More than 1 billion people consume tobacco
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.000]   in the form of cigarettes every day.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.720]   A growing number of people,
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.920]   more than half a billion people now are starting to vape.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:50.520]   The estimates range from 200 million to 500 million.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.980]   And there's a lot of debate about this
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.920]   because a lot of people are hybrid smokers and vapers,
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.000]   meaning they do one or both,
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.520]   depending on time of day and location,
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:07:59.880]   as I mentioned before.
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:04.120]   But now you start to see how you can get to the number
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.480]   that billions of people are consuming tobacco,
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.200]   because of course you also have your people
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.360]   that are dipping and your people that are snuffing.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.280]   And as I mentioned before,
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.840]   you have people that are engaging
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.520]   in multiple of these behaviors.
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:18.540]   So billions of people on planet earth,
[01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:22.480]   anywhere from one eighth to a quarter of human beings,
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:23.960]   incredible, right?
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.160]   Anywhere from one eighth to a quarter of human beings
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.800]   are consuming tobacco in one form or another
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:32.740]   in order to get their nicotine one way or another.
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:36.560]   And as a consequence are peeling years off their life,
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:39.300]   dramatically increasing the probability of cancer,
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:43.480]   stroke, heart attack, peripheral neuropathies,
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:46.560]   brain dysfunction, meaning cognitive dysfunction,
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.840]   memory impairment, sexual dysfunction.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:50.680]   There are a number of studies
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.680]   that have looked at increases in cortisol.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.680]   And while minor, those increases do exist,
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.160]   decreases in growth hormone.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:00.260]   And while minor, those decreases exist.
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:05.040]   But even setting aside the negative impact on endocrine,
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.460]   on hormone factors, it's very, very clear
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:13.000]   that smoking, vaping, dipping and snuffing
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.480]   are among the worst things that we can do for our health.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:19.720]   They are among the leading causes of preventable death
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.860]   and debilitating life conditions,
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:24.800]   which may lead you to the question
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:29.000]   as to why in the world would people do this?
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.980]   Well, it turns out most of them don't want to.
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:35.120]   In the best surveys that one can find
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.540]   of if you could quit smoking,
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.940]   if you could quit vaping, would you?
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:43.240]   What you find is that at least for cigarette smokers,
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:47.540]   70%, seven zero, want to quit.
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.180]   They would love to quit.
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:52.040]   And yet they find that to be exceedingly difficult.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.520]   And the reason they find it to be exceedingly difficult
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.600]   is because of all the brain neurochemistry
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:57.520]   that we talked about before.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.400]   The reason I spent close to 20 minutes
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.980]   talking about dopamine and the mesolimbic pathway,
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:04.440]   acetylcholine and nucleus basalis,
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:08.000]   and epinephrine and the relaxation of muscles
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.920]   in the periphery and the increase in readiness
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.780]   in the body and brain is that all of those combine
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:15.800]   to make nicotine one of the most powerful
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.640]   and potent cognitive enhancers,
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.800]   and to some extent, physical enhancer.
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.520]   Although, as I mentioned before,
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:25.000]   the total number of physical exercise
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.640]   or physical sport promoting effects of nicotine
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.740]   is very, very small, if not zero.
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:33.160]   There are certain conditions
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:36.140]   under which one might imagine using nicotine
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:37.900]   specifically for cognitive enhancement
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.400]   where performance of complex motor skills
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.880]   would sort of outweigh the negative effects
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.060]   on the neuromuscular system,
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:47.720]   our ability to generate coordinated movements.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.260]   There's actually an excellent study
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:51.280]   looking at the effects of nicotine,
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.560]   not by smoking delivery,
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.120]   but by a different delivery mechanism
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.440]   in which they looked at performance of hitters in baseball.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.180]   The experiment was kind of an interesting one.
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:03.340]   Even though these were fairly skilled baseball players,
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:05.840]   what they had them do was hit a ball off a tee.
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.320]   As I recall growing up,
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.640]   and admittedly, I didn't play much baseball,
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.040]   but you start off on tee ball and then you would go,
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.280]   I think it was to pitching machine,
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.400]   then they would use actual pitchers who throw the ball.
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:16.440]   But in this case,
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.200]   it was a couple of different baseball-related tasks.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:21.740]   They'd have people hit the ball off a tee,
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:23.520]   but they had to direct that hit
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.800]   toward a ball atop another tee.
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.080]   So it's fairly precise targeting that's required
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.000]   in order to knock that ball off the other tee.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.680]   So this is an activity that involves not just motor output,
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.440]   but coordinated motor output,
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.680]   and not just coordinated motor output,
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.640]   but directed coordinated output that requires some,
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.480]   as we would say, top-down processing, right?
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.820]   This isn't the kind of thing that can be done reflexively.
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:47.280]   This is the kind of thing where the forebrain,
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.640]   the prefrontal cortex in particular,
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.740]   has to be heavily involved
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.660]   in order to suppress certain actions
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:53.220]   and then create other actions.
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.640]   So the basic takeaway of the study
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.960]   is that nicotine delivered by way of nicotine gum,
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.160]   not by smoking, dipping, or snuffing,
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:04.280]   was able to increase cognitive performance and motor output.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.980]   So a rare circumstance where a specific set of demands
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:11.480]   that involve both cognitive engagement
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.860]   and physical engagement showed a slight,
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.560]   but significant improvement.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.640]   But again, in most cases,
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:21.240]   nicotine is just simply not going to improve physical output
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.920]   if it's delivered through a smoked cigarette,
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.780]   through vaping, through dipping, or through snuffing.
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.840]   So if all these behaviors are terrible
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.480]   for essentially every aspect of our health, frankly,
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.400]   I mean, when you look at the literature,
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.620]   it's terrible for pregnant women, it's terrible for kids,
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:37.340]   it's terrible for older people,
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.860]   it's terrible for younger people.
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:40.840]   I mean, you really cannot find a scenario
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:43.820]   in which smoking, vaping, dipping, or snuffing
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:44.920]   are good for us,
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:47.320]   and yet people like the effects on the brain
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.540]   and they feel quite addicted to them,
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:50.920]   even if they say they're not.
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:52.700]   Most of those people would be unwilling
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:56.900]   to give up their practice of nicotine delivery
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:58.100]   for more than a few hours.
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.080]   In fact, if you look at the effects of withdrawal,
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.060]   and we are going to talk about
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:03.720]   what withdrawal of nicotine looks like,
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:07.540]   what you find is that as soon as four hours
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.880]   after the last ingestion of nicotine
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:13.420]   by way of cigarette or vaping or dipping or snuffing,
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:16.320]   what people start to experience is some agitation,
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.240]   craving for nicotine, of course,
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.820]   and while craving is kind of a vague concept,
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.360]   it's actually a very specific biological mechanism,
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.840]   it's the drop in dopamine that's starting to occur,
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:29.980]   so much so that there's a drop in dopamine below baseline,
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:31.920]   that is the increase in dopamine
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.800]   that would normally be experienced
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.420]   from smoking, vaping, dipping, or snuffing
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:37.980]   is now not happening,
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.180]   and in fact, the levels of dopamine are dropping
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:41.620]   below where they would have been
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:44.520]   even without performing that behavior.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.780]   So that's what craving is,
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:50.180]   and withdrawal is an increased sense of that craving
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:52.500]   as well as a lot of negative stuff like stomach aches
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.900]   or nausea or irritability
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:56.960]   and often collections of all of those.
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.880]   So because these nicotine delivery approaches
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.100]   are so terrible for our health,
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:06.020]   and also because as many as 70% of people who smoke
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.340]   would like to quit but either feel they can't
[01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:11.260]   because they've tried and failed repeatedly often,
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:13.200]   or because it's just too scary,
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.380]   meaning the reinforcing properties are too strong
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:18.260]   and therefore they can't imagine living without them,
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:20.960]   or the withdrawal effects are too strong
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:23.720]   and they can't imagine living with those,
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:26.940]   well then is there hope for quitting smoking,
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:29.300]   vaping, snuffing, or dipping?
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.880]   And the short answer fortunately is yes,
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:33.320]   there are excellent ways to do that,
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:36.900]   and some of them are single event treatments,
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:39.500]   and we're going to talk about those shortly.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:40.360]   But before we do that,
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.460]   I want to highlight one very brief point,
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:46.580]   which is that nicotine is not the cause of cancer,
[01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:48.700]   nicotine is not the carcinogen,
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:52.100]   it's the other things in tobacco
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:55.820]   or associated with the nicotine delivery device
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:57.360]   that are causing cancer,
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.500]   and I should mention the other negative impacts
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.060]   on our health in particular
[01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:06.060]   by way of disrupted endothelial blood vessel function.
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:07.900]   Now that leads us to this issue of vaping,
[01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:11.040]   because as many of you know and probably are thinking,
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.900]   as I've been delivering this information,
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:16.740]   people don't vape tobacco,
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:19.140]   the way that vaping pens are designed
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:22.740]   is that it includes some liquid, it involves heat,
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:25.620]   and it does not involve the burning off of tobacco.
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:28.660]   In fact, there's a constant updating
[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:30.900]   of the engineering of these vape pens
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.140]   so that they can be very low heat,
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:37.260]   in some cases they use even non-heating approaches
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:39.040]   to vaporize the nicotine
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:42.580]   and allow it to enter the bloodstream very quickly.
[01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:44.100]   I must say, in a lot of ways,
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:47.720]   vaping resembles crack cocaine.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.140]   The reason why vaping and crack cocaine are so similar
[01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:55.120]   is the speed of entry of nicotine into the bloodstream.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.380]   This isn't an episode about cocaine,
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:59.300]   but I just want to very briefly touch
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:01.300]   on some of the delivery routes for cocaine,
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.100]   because they parallel a lot of the delivery routes
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:06.340]   for nicotine, and we can learn a lot
[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:09.600]   about drug pharmacokinetics and dopamine
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.200]   if we look at the parallels between cocaine and nicotine.
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:18.320]   I'll preface this by saying cocaine is a terrible drug.
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.140]   It is actually a schedule two drug in the United States,
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:23.760]   which means that it has a very, very limited,
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.980]   yet still present medical application,
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:29.680]   mainly as an anesthetic in certain laboratory
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.500]   and hospital conditions.
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.680]   But aside from that, it's very clear
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.820]   that cocaine is one of the most debilitating drugs
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:37.800]   that humans can use because of the way
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:39.620]   that it impacts the dopamine system.
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:43.140]   And it basically creates a loop whereby the only thing
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:46.860]   that can really trigger dopamine release is cocaine.
[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:50.200]   And as I've said before, the way that I define addiction
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.260]   is it's a progressive narrowing of the things
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:53.300]   that bring people pleasure.
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:55.400]   Cocaine certainly falls into the category
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.700]   of addictive drugs, strongly addictive drugs.
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:01.540]   And in fact, it has the additionally pernicious feature
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:04.860]   that after using cocaine for some period of time,
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:06.520]   the amount of dopamine that's released
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.920]   becomes progressively lower and lower and lower
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.980]   so that people can never get back to a state
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:14.420]   in which dopamine release is ever as great as it was
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:17.620]   the first time they did cocaine or prior to doing cocaine.
[01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:22.620]   Now, with a long period of no cocaine use whatsoever
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:25.820]   and protecting the dopamine system
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.380]   in a number of different ways,
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:29.860]   people can often, not always,
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:32.700]   but often recover their dopamine system,
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:35.220]   if not completely, then near completely.
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:38.560]   So by all means, if you have a problem with cocaine,
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:41.100]   quit, find a way to quit, get treatment,
[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:42.760]   get over that one way or another.
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:46.280]   We have an episode with an expert guest, Dr. Anna Lemke,
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:47.900]   who's a physician and the chief
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:49.540]   of the Stanford School of Medicine
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:51.700]   Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic.
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:54.760]   She's a world expert in dopamine and addictive substances
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.180]   and addictions of all kinds.
[01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:58.460]   You can find that episode at Hubermanlab.com.
[01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:01.020]   It's filled with information about how to get over
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:03.120]   different types of addictions, including cocaine addiction.
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.320]   Also check out her absolutely phenomenal
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.200]   and indeed important book, "Dopamine Nation,"
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.680]   which touches on some of this as well.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.980]   And in the show note captions for the episode
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.120]   where Dr. Lemke was my guest,
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.760]   you can also find some additional resources
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:16.600]   related to that.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:19.320]   So cocaine is terrible, that needs to be acknowledged.
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.780]   It should be avoided and you should find a way to quit it
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.240]   if you are currently using.
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:27.580]   With that said, the delivery mechanism for cocaine
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:30.900]   strongly parallels the delivery mechanisms for nicotine.
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:32.600]   That is, people will snort cocaine,
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.720]   which is a lot like snuffing or dipping.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:36.260]   That is, when people snort cocaine,
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:38.780]   they're bringing cocaine into proximity or into contact
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:41.820]   really with the mucosal lining of the nasal passages,
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:44.620]   which then allows the psychoactive substances
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:46.960]   to permeate into the bloodstream.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:49.100]   Very seldom do people eat it,
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:52.100]   although that does happen from time to time.
[01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:55.060]   People will inject it as so-called mainlining,
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:57.040]   which is a very rapid entry into the bloodstream
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.680]   because it's direct application to the bloodstream
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:00.780]   by way of injection.
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:02.280]   And then there's crack cocaine,
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:05.140]   which is essentially like a vaporizing of the cocaine
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:07.660]   from a so-called cocaine rock.
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:12.660]   That somewhat resembles vaping of nicotine.
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:15.360]   So while the vape pen involves a liquid
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:17.740]   that sold a cartridge that contains nicotine
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:20.340]   and often other flavors as well,
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:21.820]   flavorings, I should say,
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:27.860]   both crack cocaine and vaping cause very rapid increases
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:29.900]   in the relative substances that are psychoactive.
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:32.100]   In the case of cocaine, that would be cocaine.
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.880]   And the increase in dopamine in the brain and body,
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:35.720]   I should mention.
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.060]   And in the case of vaping,
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:39.780]   there's a very rapid increase in blood concentrations
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:43.340]   of nicotine, much faster than occur with cigarette smoking
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:45.780]   or other modes of nicotine delivery.
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:49.760]   So that speed of onset turns out to be a critical parameter
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:52.520]   because the speed of onset of nicotine
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.100]   is going to also determine the speed of release of dopamine
[01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:58.180]   in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area,
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.520]   that mesolimbic reward pathway.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.180]   And with the mesolimbic reward pathway,
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:04.440]   it's not just about the peak,
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:08.200]   meaning the maximal amount of dopamine that's released,
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:11.020]   but it's the time course, how steep the curve is,
[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:12.680]   how quickly that dopamine increases,
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.180]   that's going to determine how reinforcing,
[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:17.560]   how habit forming and indeed how addictive
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.380]   a particular substance is.
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.600]   So one of the major important differences
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.400]   between vaping and cigarette smoking
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:27.600]   is that the onset of dopamine release from vaping is faster.
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.420]   And even a subtle increase in the rate
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:33.860]   at which dopamine increases in the mesolimbic reward pathway
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:37.180]   can make a given amount of nicotine
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:40.780]   much more habit forming and addictive.
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:44.580]   This probably explains the fact that many, many more people
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:47.300]   in particular young people, age 25 and younger,
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:50.300]   are vaping at phenomenal rates now.
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:52.780]   People are starting to vape in just about everywhere.
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:54.740]   You see this in restaurants, you see it on the street.
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:57.220]   Indeed, you even see it in the classroom.
[01:20:57.220 --> 01:21:00.300]   This has actually become sort of sport of sports.
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:02.020]   It's certainly not something I encourage.
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:05.000]   In fact, when I learned about this from a college student,
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.220]   new college student,
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.180]   is telling me that many college students
[01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:10.020]   are actually bringing vape pens into the classroom.
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.840]   I think this is also happening in high schools
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:13.800]   and even junior high schools.
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.560]   This is a really concerning practice.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:18.500]   And here, I'm not trying to come across as the,
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.040]   you know, the anti-vaping crusader,
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.520]   but I must say given the negative effects
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.280]   on one's health in the longterm,
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:28.040]   but also given these exceedingly powerful reward properties
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:30.760]   of nicotine entering the bloodstream quickly
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.340]   and dopamine being released very quickly
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:35.680]   from the mesolimbic reward pathway,
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.320]   what we're seeing out there makes total sense.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:42.000]   Young people's brains are essentially getting wired
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.160]   to the expectation that dopamine
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.140]   is going to be increased dramatically and quickly
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:50.100]   under their control, except it's under their control
[01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:52.480]   only in a very narrow set of circumstances.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.320]   Recall the definition of addiction,
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.320]   a progressive narrowing of the things
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.160]   that bring you pleasure.
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:01.000]   We can change that statement to also say
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.100]   a progressive narrowing and specific kinetics,
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:07.480]   that is specific time course
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:09.160]   of the things that bring you pleasure.
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.800]   Now that's a bit of a nerdier statement
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.680]   than a progressive narrowing
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:12.700]   of the things that bring you pleasure.
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:16.560]   But what we're going to see in the next few years, I believe,
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:19.000]   is an entire generation of young people
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.880]   for which a very large percentage of them
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:25.520]   are going to be seeking out a pattern or feeling,
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.680]   because to the person taking it,
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.200]   they're not looking at their dopamine levels
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.280]   rising in their blood,
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.320]   they're experiencing this as an increase in focus,
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:34.340]   an increase in alertness, an increase in mood and wellbeing
[01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:37.360]   that is very rapid, very dramatic,
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:41.960]   and that simply cannot be recreated by any other substance.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:44.540]   And that's a very concerning scenario,
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:47.600]   concerning because that mesolimbic reward pathway
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:51.000]   is the only pathway, the only pathway
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.620]   by which you can achieve the rewarding properties
[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:57.900]   of any kind of endeavor, not just vaping, of course,
[01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:00.280]   it is the way in which people achieve satisfaction
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:04.000]   from reaching a relationship goal or an athletic goal
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.920]   or an educational goal, any kind of goal
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:08.160]   or sense of satisfaction.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.360]   And so it comes as no surprise
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.620]   that vaping is strongly associated
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:14.440]   with increased levels of depression,
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.560]   especially when vaping use drops off.
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:17.440]   Why would that be?
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.260]   If people are getting so much more dopamine
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.660]   so much more quickly from vaping,
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:22.520]   shouldn't they be feeling better?
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.860]   That brings us back to the critical,
[01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:26.520]   and I should say defining feature
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:29.860]   of the dopamine reward pathway for motivation and wellbeing,
[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:33.080]   which is that initially a given substance will cause,
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:35.920]   let's say an eight out of 10, again, arbitrary units,
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:39.100]   but eight out of 10 increase in dopamine,
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.740]   but with repeated use, what ends up happening
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:45.280]   is that even at similar or higher levels of ingestion,
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.360]   so not just one inhalation a minute,
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.060]   but maybe two inhalations a minute
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:51.520]   or inhalation every 30 seconds,
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.660]   now it's level four out of 10 activation of dopamine
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:55.760]   and then three and then two,
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:58.040]   and eventually it drops below baseline.
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:00.280]   Now the whole system can be recovered by abstinence
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.740]   from nicotine consumption,
[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:04.960]   but the dopamine system is applied to everything,
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:07.600]   all sense of wellbeing, all sense of motivation.
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:10.300]   So during the period in which one is abstaining
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:12.800]   from nicotine and vaping in particular,
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:15.960]   people do not feel good, they feel miserable.
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.120]   That's why it's called withdrawal.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.420]   It's associated with a bunch of psychological
[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:24.020]   and physiological symptoms that all lead back
[01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:27.560]   to trying to get to the same levels of dopamine release
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.900]   in the same patterns that were experienced
[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:32.160]   when one initially started vaping.
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:33.960]   So I'm not trying to paint a dark picture here,
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.600]   but frankly, the picture is very dark.
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:40.320]   I'm very concerned about a practice of ingesting something
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.800]   that powerfully modulates the dopamine system
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.480]   with the sorts of kinetics that one sees
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.800]   from ingestion of crack cocaine in young people
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.860]   that has all these other negative health effects
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:51.280]   that in the short term is very powerfully rewarding,
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.440]   increased focus, wellbeing, et cetera,
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.320]   but that over a very brief period of time
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:00.780]   leads to a state in which the entire dopamine reward system
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:03.800]   is impaired and can become permanently impaired
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:06.840]   unless one intervenes in a very deliberate way.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:09.960]   So people are directly controlling the rate of dopamine
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:12.080]   and the frequency of dopamine release
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.440]   by the duration and frequency of inhalations
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:16.760]   off the vape pen.
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:19.960]   And that's an incredible thing because what it does
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:22.280]   is it sets up the mesolimbic reward pathway
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.840]   for an expectation that dopamine will be delivered
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.560]   on that schedule.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:30.320]   So that's one of the things that makes vaping in particular
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.400]   so hard to quit.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.960]   Vaping is actually harder to quit than cigarette smoking
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.880]   for most people.
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.520]   Now, does that mean that cigarette smoking
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.920]   is fairly easy to quit for most people?
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:45.040]   No, 70% of people who smoke cigarettes
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.520]   report that they would like to quit
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.860]   if they thought they could.
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:51.120]   The success rate of quitting smoking
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:53.120]   when people try to go just cold turkey,
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.880]   just quit with no assistance whatsoever,
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:56.220]   they might tell their family and friends,
[01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:59.360]   hey, I'm quitting, that's it, is exceedingly low.
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.360]   It's 5%.
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.820]   So 5% of the people that say, that's it,
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:08.220]   I'm not smoking again, despite cancer diagnosis,
[01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:09.060]   I'm not smoking again,
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:10.660]   despite the fear of the negative health effects,
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.640]   I'm not going to ever smoke again,
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.080]   despite the financial costs, the health costs.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:18.240]   I mean, I could list off the huge number of things
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.080]   that it does that are negative,
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.160]   but you already know these, or you've heard them,
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:22.960]   it makes your skin worse.
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:26.840]   As I mentioned, it lowers libido, it disrupts hormones,
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:30.600]   it disrupts vascular function, brain function,
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:31.800]   it does all these terrible things,
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:34.240]   and yet most people who try and quit simply can't.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.940]   And of the 5% that succeed in quitting,
[01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:40.540]   a full 65% of them relapse within a year.
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:42.860]   So that's a very depressing picture,
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:45.000]   but it's not to say that people cannot quit,
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:45.940]   and in fact, they can.
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:47.480]   There are a couple of methods that have been shown
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:49.420]   to help people quit.
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:53.040]   Some are behavioral and some are pharmacologic.
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:55.380]   I just want to touch on the behavioral ones first,
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:58.820]   because it turns out that there's a quite powerful method
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:02.740]   for quitting nicotine ingestion by way of cigarette smoking,
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:04.720]   which also carries over to vaping.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.460]   This is beautiful work that's been done by my colleague,
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:08.740]   in fact, close collaborator,
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:10.220]   although I was not involved in the research
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:12.160]   that I'm about to describe, at Stanford,
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.340]   and his name is Dr. David Spiegel.
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:16.540]   He is our associate chair of psychiatry.
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:18.500]   He's been a guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:21.780]   and he is a world expert, if not the world expert,
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:24.120]   in the clinical applications of hypnosis.
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:25.240]   Now, when I say hypnosis,
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.980]   a lot of people think stage hypnosis,
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:28.540]   which is the hypnotist trying to get people
[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:30.920]   to do certain things and say certain things,
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.920]   not necessarily against their will,
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.120]   because they actually have to agree,
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:35.980]   but the hypnotist is dictating
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:38.860]   what the person thinks, says, and does.
[01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:41.860]   Clinical hypnosis is vastly different from that.
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:44.980]   Clinical hypnosis is where the person, the patient,
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:47.860]   actually directs their own brain changes
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:51.120]   toward a specific emotional or behavioral goal.
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:55.340]   Work from Dr. David Spiegel's laboratory, done in 1993,
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:57.620]   but that now has been repeated many, many times,
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:59.460]   and has carried over into some more modern studies,
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:01.920]   and I'll provide links to those studies
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:04.740]   in the show note caption so that you can access them.
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:06.000]   Those studies have shown
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.900]   that using a specific form of hypnosis,
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:13.940]   people can achieve complete and total cessation
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:15.680]   of cigarette smoking,
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.760]   and there's no reason to believe
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:19.060]   this doesn't also carry over to vaping
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:21.740]   through one single hypnosis session,
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:24.360]   and the success rates are incredibly high
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.800]   when one considers that normally
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:28.260]   it would be only a 5% success rate.
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:30.420]   The success rate with this particular hypnosis
[01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:32.280]   developed at Stanford School of Medicine
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:35.900]   by Dr. David Spiegel is 23% of people
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:39.600]   who do this hypnosis one time succeed in quitting smoking.
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:43.580]   Now, in the old days, which actually wasn't that long ago,
[01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:45.700]   before the advent of smartphones
[01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:47.740]   and before the internet took off
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:49.340]   to the extent that it has now,
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:52.700]   this was done by having someone come into the clinic
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:55.300]   and Dr. Spiegel himself or one of his colleagues
[01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:57.300]   would take somebody through the hypnosis.
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:29:00.580]   Nowadays, you can access this hypnosis.
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:02.140]   There's a wonderful app
[01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:05.240]   that was developed by Dr. David Spiegel and others.
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:07.820]   It's called Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.
[01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:10.000]   I've talked about this app a few times on the podcast before
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.280]   because there are hypnosis scripts within the app
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:14.900]   for enhancing sleep, for improving ability to fall asleep
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:16.480]   if you wake up in the middle of the night,
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:18.160]   for focus and a number of other
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.520]   behavioral and emotional changes.
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:23.000]   There's also a function in the Reveri app
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.660]   for smoking cessation,
[01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:28.880]   which exactly parallels the sort of in laboratory
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.940]   and in clinic approaches that Dr. Spiegel would use
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:34.420]   were you to show up at his clinic or in his laboratory,
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:35.900]   and since that's not possible
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:37.860]   for the large number of people out there,
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:40.740]   if you or somebody else is trying to quit smoking
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:45.140]   or vaping or dipping or snuffing for that matter,
[01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:47.820]   I strongly encourage you to check out the Reveri app.
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:50.780]   You can find it easily by going to reveri.com.
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:52.660]   It's available in various formats.
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:55.580]   Some of it is available free, some of it is behind a paywall,
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:57.900]   but given the tremendously negative impact
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:00.400]   of smoking, vaping, dipping, and snuffing,
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:05.380]   the hypnosis for smoking cessation that Reveri has
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:07.040]   seems at least to me
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.580]   as a very powerful and worthwhile resource.
[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:10.580]   So please check that out
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:13.860]   if you're somebody who's trying to quit ingesting nicotine
[01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:16.600]   by any of the four methods that I just described.
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:17.760]   Now, of course, there are other methods
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:20.260]   that people have used to successfully quit smoking or vaping
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:22.980]   or other forms of nicotine delivery.
[01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:25.380]   And there's actually an excellent review on this topic.
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:27.240]   So before diving into a few of the specifics
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:31.220]   about some of the pharmacology of using nicotine itself
[01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:34.060]   to quit smoking or nicotine itself to quit vaping,
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:38.100]   or the use of various things, even SSRIs, antidepressants,
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:40.340]   to quit smoking or vaping,
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:42.080]   I just want to point you to a review article
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:43.680]   that if you'd like to get a complete survey
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.620]   of all the options that are available,
[01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:47.700]   there's an excellent review on this.
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:50.180]   It was published just a couple of years ago in 2020.
[01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:52.620]   The title of the article is "Pharmacologic Approach
[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:53.860]   to Smoking Cessation,
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:56.540]   an Updated Review for Daily Clinical Practice."
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:59.840]   And even though this is mainly focused on smoking cessation,
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:02.380]   it carries over quite nicely to vaping.
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:04.260]   And it details a number of statistics.
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:07.460]   The fact that every year 700,000 or more people die
[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:08.940]   because of smoking-related diseases.
[01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:11.980]   So there again, you have the negative health effects
[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:13.340]   that younger people are smoking,
[01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:14.940]   that women are smoking more nowadays,
[01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:16.360]   and that even though you see less smoking,
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:17.980]   typically in the US and Canada,
[01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:19.900]   and even in Northern Europe, some places,
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:21.380]   there's still many, many people are smoking
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:22.660]   who would like to quit.
[01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:24.800]   But that 75% of people,
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.980]   at least according to this review earlier, I said 70%,
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:29.620]   but estimates are as high as 75% of people
[01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:32.720]   who try to quit smoking relapse within the first week.
[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:34.260]   The first week, they just go right back to it.
[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:36.780]   That's how powerfully reinforcing the nicotine is.
[01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:38.680]   Remember, it's the nicotine in the cigarette
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:39.880]   that's powerfully reinforcing,
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:44.880]   but it's also the oral habit, the motor habit.
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:47.780]   There is this thing about density of sensory receptors
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:48.620]   in the lips.
[01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:50.580]   People like bringing things to their lips.
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:56.460]   Food, cigarettes, other lips in some cases, et cetera.
[01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:58.960]   There is a reinforcement pathway related to that
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:01.440]   for sort of obvious adaptive reasons.
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:03.940]   And as a consequence,
[01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:06.560]   there is a reinforcement both from the behavior
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:09.140]   and from the dopamine released from the nicotine itself.
[01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:10.520]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:12.680]   from the positive reinforcement
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:13.920]   that comes from increased focus,
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.240]   so the money that you make through work
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:16.640]   or your attentional ability,
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:18.600]   or the fact that you're alert and people feel you present,
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:21.860]   all of that funnels back into positive reinforcement,
[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:23.760]   behavioral reinforcement,
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:26.240]   and then what we would call addiction.
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.520]   So this review covers all of that.
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.220]   And then steps beautifully
[01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:33.760]   through nicotine replacement therapy and various compounds,
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.740]   several of which I'm going to talk about now,
[01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:37.980]   which have been shown to increase that number
[01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:40.620]   that we talked about earlier of only 5% of people
[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:43.080]   who try to quit with no other support,
[01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:44.880]   pharmacologic or hypnosis or otherwise,
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:47.040]   just say, that's it, I'm not going to smoke again,
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.680]   or I'm not going to vape again.
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:50.880]   Only 5% of people succeed in doing that.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:53.760]   And even among those, many end up relapsing later.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:55.860]   There are a couple of pharmacologic approaches.
[01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:57.800]   One of the main ones that's received a lot of attention
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:00.080]   in recent years is Bupriperone,
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:04.080]   sometimes referred to by its commercial name, Wellbutrin.
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:07.800]   Now, Bupriperone is a compound
[01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:10.020]   that increases the release of dopamine
[01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:11.900]   and to a lesser extent, epinephrine,
[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:13.600]   and some other neurochemicals as well.
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.600]   It's used for the treatment of depression
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.720]   and for smoking cessation.
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:19.920]   Now, I want to point out again, I'm not a psychiatrist,
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.120]   so I'm not telling you to take Bupriperone,
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:24.520]   AKA Wellbutrin, but I'm going to give you a little bit
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.640]   of the contour of what's typically done
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:28.460]   in terms of Bupriperone administration
[01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:30.360]   to help people get relief
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:32.240]   from some of the withdrawal symptoms
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.900]   of trying to quit smoking or vaping
[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:36.540]   or other forms of nicotine ingestion.
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.780]   Typically, Bupriperone is taken
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:41.440]   in 300 milligram per day doses
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:44.160]   divided into two dosages of 150 milligrams each,
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:47.200]   or sometimes there's a slow release formula.
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:49.900]   The dosages will vary from person to person.
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:51.400]   I want to really emphasize
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:54.640]   that there is an increased seizure risk with Bupriperone.
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:56.940]   It only occurs in a small fraction of the population,
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:58.960]   but nonetheless is a real concern
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:00.380]   for those members of the population.
[01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:02.220]   So for those of you with seizure risk,
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.620]   whether you know it or not,
[01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:06.120]   that's going to be a valid concern
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:07.960]   in terms of potential side effects.
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:11.720]   The other thing about Bupriperone is that it has to be used
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:13.720]   with caution in patients that have liver disease
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:16.600]   or renal disease that can impact the amount
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:17.440]   that anyone can take,
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.660]   meaning sometimes people have to take a much lower dose
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:22.200]   if they have renal disease or liver disease,
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:23.900]   and sometimes they can't take it at all.
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:26.240]   Sometimes if people are taking benzodiazepines
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:28.180]   for whatever reason or other sedatives,
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:29.740]   there are contraindications there.
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:33.360]   So Bupriperone isn't a kind of one size fits all
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:35.480]   or magic bullet for quitting smoking.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:38.040]   Nonetheless, for people that can take it safely,
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.840]   and again, this is a prescription drug,
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:42.160]   a board certified psychiatrist or other physician
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:43.560]   is going to have to prescribe it for you
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:44.640]   if it's appropriate for you,
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:47.440]   and it moves that number of 5% success rate
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:50.520]   to about what one sees with the clinical hypnosis
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:55.060]   to about 20% of people will successfully
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:56.780]   overcome their nicotine,
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:35:00.260]   or I should say their smoking or vaping addiction.
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:03.080]   Now it's important to ask why this would work, right?
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:05.180]   I mean, it's not as if Bupriperone
[01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:08.180]   is increasing nicotine per se.
[01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:09.540]   What it's doing is it's tapping
[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:12.300]   on that mesolimbic reward pathway, increasing dopamine,
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:13.780]   or at least allowing dopamine levels
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:16.560]   to stay substantially elevated enough
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:19.880]   that people don't experience some of the drop in dopamine
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.380]   that leads to the withdrawal symptoms,
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:22.840]   the lessening of mood, et cetera,
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.560]   and it's no coincidence that Bupriperone
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:26.400]   is also an antidepressant.
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:27.920]   It's a common antidepressant
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:29.720]   for people that experience negative side effects
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:31.240]   with the so-called SSRIs,
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:33.840]   the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:35.360]   that prevent them from taking those things
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.160]   like lessen libido or appetite,
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.280]   or in some cases increased appetite,
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:41.620]   or any number of other side effects that some people,
[01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:43.720]   not all, but some people experience with SSRIs.
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:46.680]   They'll be prescribed Wellbutrin, Bupriperone
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:48.160]   is the generic name.
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:49.880]   So Wellbutrin being the commercial name,
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:53.160]   again, Bupriperone is what they'll be prescribed instead.
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:57.560]   With the caveats of seizure risk, renal disease,
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:58.880]   liver disease, et cetera,
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.400]   the outcomes with Wellbutrin for smoking cessation
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.240]   are pretty good.
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.920]   I mean, if you think about an increase from 5% to 20%,
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:07.080]   that's pretty dramatic.
[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:10.320]   And yet I also want to refer back to the incredible success
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.080]   of the clinical hypnosis approach.
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.680]   Again, you can find that at reverie.com.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:17.080]   The clinical hypnosis approach has a success rate
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:20.740]   of 23%, so it's very closely aligned with,
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:24.400]   if not exceeding the success rate with Bupriperone.
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:26.560]   Of course, there are other pharmacologic approaches
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:29.580]   to quitting smoking or vaping.
[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:33.020]   All of them generally circle back to increasing dopamine
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.200]   and or norepinephrine in order to offset
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:38.420]   some of the withdrawal symptoms of smoking sensation
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:39.680]   or vaping cessation.
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:42.740]   A very common approach for people to try and quit smoking
[01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:47.420]   or vaping is to use nicotine itself to try
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:49.820]   and prevent people from seeking nicotine
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:52.260]   through a cigarette or a vape pen.
[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:55.220]   What I mean by that is people using a nicotine patch
[01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:59.060]   or nicotine gum or other nicotine delivery device
[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:01.980]   that is not cigarettes and not vaping
[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:05.200]   in order to maintain levels of nicotine
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.060]   in their bloodstream,
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:09.220]   which of course means maintain levels of nicotine
[01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:12.140]   in their brain and body to the same extent
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:15.000]   that they would if they were smoking or vaping,
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.380]   maybe even gradually taking down the total amount
[01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:22.680]   of nicotine in their brain and body by reducing the number
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:26.380]   or size of nicotine gum pieces that they ingest each day
[01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:29.000]   or keeping the patch on for a shorter amount of time
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.340]   or getting a lower dose patch
[01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:34.300]   that releases less nicotine total or over time.
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:37.180]   All of those approaches have been shown
[01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:39.100]   to be reasonably successful.
[01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:40.160]   I'll get to the numbers in a few minutes,
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:43.320]   but reasonably successful in allowing people
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:47.100]   to quit smoking or vaping.
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:49.740]   Again, most of the data is on cigarette smoking
[01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:52.180]   because vaping is a relatively new phenomenon,
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:54.420]   although quite troublingly,
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:57.780]   it's a very rapidly increasing behavior,
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:37:59.300]   especially in the young population.
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:01.420]   So that's why I'm kind of lumping these two things together
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:05.420]   because I think very soon we are going to need
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:09.540]   an all out campaign for how to counter vaping addiction.
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:11.900]   So what do we know about smoking sensation
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:13.540]   using nicotine itself?
[01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:14.780]   Is the patch best?
[01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:16.500]   Is nicotine gum best?
[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:20.500]   It turns out that a combination of approaches is best.
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:21.620]   So somewhat surprising,
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:22.820]   but it was very clear from the literature
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:26.160]   that I was able to find that using nicotine patches
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:29.060]   for some period of time and then switching to a gum
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:33.120]   and then perhaps switching to a nasal spray,
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:34.940]   that's going to be the most effective.
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:38.100]   Then the question is how long to continue each of those
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:39.580]   and whether or not to overlap them.
[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:42.080]   It seems as if doing one for about a week
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:43.700]   and then switching to another for about a week
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:46.860]   and then switching to another is one rational
[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:47.780]   and reasonable approach
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:50.160]   that many people have used successfully.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:51.000]   Why would that be?
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.700]   Well, it all has to do with the different rates
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:55.380]   of absorption of nicotine into the bloodstream
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:57.740]   and then the downstream consequences of that
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:00.420]   on the dopamine, acetylcholine, epinephrine
[01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:02.600]   and other systems of the brain and body.
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:05.940]   And while there hasn't been an extremely detailed study
[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:08.860]   of the exact kinetics of how the nasal sprays
[01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:11.400]   versus the transdermal patches versus the gums, et cetera,
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.500]   work, there's a logical structure to it
[01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:14.840]   that will immediately make sense to you.
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.300]   First of all, the transdermal patches
[01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:20.140]   provide a fairly steady state dopamine release
[01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:21.380]   across the day.
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:23.740]   And oftentimes people are wearing them at night as well.
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:26.800]   This is relevant because if people are ingesting nicotine
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:29.300]   by way of smoking and vaping,
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:31.900]   hopefully they're not waking up in the middle of the night
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:33.300]   just to smoke or vape or believe it or not,
[01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:34.160]   some people do that.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:36.360]   But of course, while people are asleep,
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:38.500]   they are not smoking or vaping.
[01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:39.420]   They always tell you don't fall asleep
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:40.260]   with a cigarette in your mouth.
[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:42.300]   You burn the whole house down.
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:45.460]   But exceedingly rare to have people
[01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:46.980]   who are smoking in their sleep.
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:48.580]   So people wake up in the morning
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:51.540]   and because the half-life of nicotine from smoking or vaping
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:54.000]   is very short, anywhere from one to two hours,
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.620]   they are essentially in a state of withdrawal
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:56.980]   at the point where they wake up in the morning.
[01:39:56.980 --> 01:39:57.820]   How can I say that?
[01:39:57.820 --> 01:40:00.420]   Well, remember withdrawal sets in about four hours
[01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:03.160]   after the last ingestion of nicotine by cigarette
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:05.060]   or by inhalation from the vape pen.
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:07.740]   So people are waking up in nicotine withdrawal
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:10.020]   and then immediately going into the behavior
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:12.060]   of ingesting nicotine or very soon after waking
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:13.600]   for most people.
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:16.560]   So nicotine patch is going to be very effective
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.620]   for a week or so.
[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:18.620]   Again, talk to your physician
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:20.460]   about the best approach for this,
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:23.900]   but then switching to a nasal spray
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:26.140]   or switching to nicotine gum for about a week,
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:27.600]   which is going to change the kinetics
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.700]   of that nicotine absorption to the bloodstream
[01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:32.100]   and change the release of dopamine
[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:33.760]   and other neurochemicals within the brain.
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.200]   That's going to keep the system intentionally off balance
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:40.860]   so that it never comes to expect one single pattern
[01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:44.020]   or amplitude of dopamine release.
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:47.660]   And that is a very powerful way for a,
[01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:51.700]   let's just call it a quitting method to work
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:53.320]   because as I've always said,
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:56.240]   the most powerful schedule of dopamine
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:59.120]   is going to be this random intermittent reward.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:00.860]   This is what's used in the casinos
[01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:02.080]   in order to take your money.
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:03.740]   And generally they do on average,
[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:06.300]   they take your money more than you take theirs
[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:09.340]   and they take more of it, not just more often
[01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:11.820]   because they use this random intermittent schedule.
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:13.220]   The random intermittent schedule
[01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:14.860]   is one in which you don't really know
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:17.300]   when the peaks in dopamine are going to arrive.
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:19.780]   And so there isn't this expectation and craving.
[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:21.480]   And then all of a sudden when dopamine is released,
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:22.380]   it's extremely high.
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:23.740]   That's how they get you to continue playing,
[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:25.320]   even though basically you're losing money
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:26.340]   and your dopamine is dropping.
[01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:29.220]   They elevate it every once in a while.
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:31.740]   Nicotine replacement can be used in a similar way,
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:32.880]   but in a benevolent way
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:36.260]   in order to help you get over smoking or vaping
[01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:39.040]   by keeping the total amounts of dopamine variable
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:40.740]   around the clock.
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:43.580]   And by changing the amount of dopamine that's released,
[01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:46.960]   it seems to help people behaviorally and psychologically
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:48.380]   because they don't come to expect
[01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:49.900]   having a particular amount of dopamine
[01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:51.740]   in their brain and blood at any given time.
[01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:53.660]   And this is an important point
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:56.820]   because it brings us to this notion of homeostasis.
[01:41:56.820 --> 01:41:59.480]   Homeostasis is this tendency for biological systems
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:01.120]   to try and reach equilibrium.
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:02.540]   What goes up, goes down, et cetera,
[01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:04.820]   and to some extent to the same degree.
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:05.820]   So I'll talk about this right now
[01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:09.820]   in the context of nicotine use, withdrawal,
[01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:12.280]   and then the period in which people
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:14.500]   no longer crave nicotine.
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:16.940]   So you can imagine that if we were to measure
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:18.460]   your heart rate, your blood pressure,
[01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:21.260]   and your overall levels of alertness and wellbeing and mood,
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:23.080]   let's just give that some value.
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:24.700]   Let's say it runs from zero to 10.
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:25.760]   Again, arbitrary units.
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.980]   Let's just take all those physiological measures
[01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:29.660]   and the subjective measure of your mood,
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:33.940]   and let's measure it four times an hour across the day,
[01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:34.980]   across the waking hours.
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:36.080]   What we would find is a line
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:37.580]   that would kind of squiggle a bit.
[01:42:37.580 --> 01:42:39.860]   Maybe a nice text comes in that you really like.
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:42.000]   Maybe you get a not so good news
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.340]   and your kind of autonomic arousal is all over the place.
[01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:47.500]   But on average, it's kind of a squiggly line
[01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:48.800]   where it increases in the morning
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.720]   'cause that's typically when body temperature
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:52.160]   and autonomic arousal increase.
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.220]   And then towards the afternoon,
[01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:54.260]   it's going to come sloping down.
[01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:55.100]   And then right before sleep,
[01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:56.100]   there'll be an increase again.
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:56.980]   You know, if you've ever felt that,
[01:42:56.980 --> 01:42:58.320]   you kind of run around a lot before sleep,
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:59.280]   and then it goes down.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:03.220]   That's kind of the typical contour of autonomic arousal,
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:05.700]   mood, et cetera, across the day.
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:07.740]   Removing, of course, life events
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:10.100]   and things like psychiatric illness
[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:12.140]   and depression and et cetera,
[01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:13.920]   that's the typical arc of that.
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.020]   Now let's superimpose on whatever that contour is for you.
[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:18.860]   Nicotine.
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:21.740]   So get a little bolus, as we say,
[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:23.940]   a little bit of nicotine from smoking a cigarette
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:25.640]   or from taking inhalation on a vape pen.
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:27.360]   What ends up happening is there's an increase
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:28.760]   in blood pressure, increase in heart rate,
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:30.340]   increase in mood, increase in alertness,
[01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:32.260]   all the things we talked about earlier.
[01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:37.180]   Over time, the body starts to adjust
[01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:42.180]   so that the baseline upon which that nicotine-induced
[01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:47.600]   increase in arousal would occur is actually reduced, right?
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:48.460]   Why would that be?
[01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:51.140]   Well, the body and the brain,
[01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:53.020]   your physiology seeks homeostasis.
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:56.020]   So if there's a big increase in all those things
[01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:57.920]   like blood pressure and mood, et cetera,
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:00.700]   typically your baseline will drop a little bit
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:03.180]   to compensate for that over time after a couple of days
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:05.020]   or even weeks of ingesting nicotine.
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:06.140]   So let's say you wake up,
[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:08.820]   you typically take an inhalation off your vape
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:11.660]   or you have a cigarette around nine or 10 a.m.
[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:13.260]   You do that daily.
[01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:15.700]   You get used to a certain level of mood and alertness
[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:17.420]   and wellbeing for that time of day.
[01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:20.120]   And then if you smoke again in the afternoon, let's say,
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:22.300]   you also get accustomed to a certain level of mood
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:25.020]   and alertness and wellbeing for that time of day.
[01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:26.820]   Again, it'll vary depending on life events,
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:28.440]   but your system sort of gets used to it
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:30.980]   and your baseline will drop to compensate for those peaks
[01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:33.180]   so that the peaks aren't quite as high as they were
[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:35.300]   when you first started using nicotine.
[01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:36.420]   Now you decide to quit.
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:38.440]   So now what we're talking about is transitioning
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:40.580]   from the consumption
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:43.100]   to what we're going to call the withdrawal phase.
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.600]   Now what happens is you say, "That's it.
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.100]   I'm going cold turkey.
[01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:47.780]   I know there's only a 5% success rate,
[01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:49.020]   but I'm going to just go cold turkey."
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:51.980]   Or somebody will say, "No, I'm going to use the Reverie app."
[01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:55.080]   Or somebody says, "No, I'm going to use buprenorphine
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:56.920]   or another method or nicotine patch
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:57.940]   or something of that sort."
[01:44:57.940 --> 01:44:59.660]   Well, setting aside the nicotine patch
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:01.500]   or the nicotine delivery device
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:04.180]   and only focusing on approaches
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:05.860]   for getting through withdrawal
[01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:09.260]   that have no direct effects on nicotine, okay?
[01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:10.620]   So not using the nicotine patch,
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:14.140]   but say the hypnosis or buprenorphine,
[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:15.540]   which can increase dopamine,
[01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:19.440]   but it doesn't increase nicotine directly, what happens?
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:23.960]   The day that you quit, that homeostatic mechanism
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:25.120]   in your brain and body
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:27.900]   that sets your level of mood and arousal, et cetera,
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:30.920]   does not know and hasn't adjusted to the fact
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:32.340]   that you're not bringing in nicotine.
[01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:33.420]   You're not having that cigarette.
[01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:35.840]   You're not having that inhalation on the vape pen.
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:38.080]   So what ends up happening is that baseline,
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:41.560]   which has been adjusted down to offset the increases
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:45.960]   in mood and alertness, et cetera, when you smoke or vape,
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:48.280]   is lower than it normally would be.
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:52.900]   So that 9 a.m. cigarette time or vape inhalation time
[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:55.420]   no longer feels above baseline.
[01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:57.420]   It actually feels below baseline
[01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:02.420]   because what you're seeing is the lower amplitude of arousal
[01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:05.900]   that was there to offset the increase you were getting
[01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:07.220]   from vaping or smoking.
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:08.320]   And then in the afternoon,
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.460]   if normally you have a kind of phase of your afternoon
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:11.720]   you really enjoy, you go outside,
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:13.460]   you have a vape or a cigarette,
[01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:15.420]   you normally are feeling relaxed or you go out at night,
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:16.240]   you'd like to vape and you say,
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:18.020]   "Nope, I'm not going to do that anymore."
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:20.960]   You're going to feel much, much worse
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:23.380]   than you would have had you never started smoking or vaping.
[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:25.900]   Now that's not much help to anyone
[01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:27.780]   who's already started smoking or vaping.
[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:30.860]   But I say this because it's very important to understand
[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:33.100]   that the reason why relapse rates are so high
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:33.980]   within the first week,
[01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:36.900]   75% of people relapse within one week
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:39.980]   and overall failure rates are 95%,
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:43.220]   is because people don't expect to feel even worse
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:46.060]   than they did prior to ever smoking or vaping.
[01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:48.740]   So that first week is absolutely critical.
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:50.220]   And the beauty of understanding this
[01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:52.580]   is that if you can get through that first week,
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:55.860]   either by sheer grit or by finding other methods
[01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:58.780]   to increase dopamine, healthy methods, I would hope,
[01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:01.060]   and certainly cold showers, ice baths
[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:03.540]   have been shown to do that, by the way.
[01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:07.360]   This was described in Dr. Analemki's book, "Dopamine Nation."
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:09.500]   Cold showers can increase dopamine exercise,
[01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.360]   positive social interactions.
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:13.780]   It's very likely that people will need to use
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:17.140]   other healthy methods to offset that reduction in dopamine
[01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:19.780]   if ever they stand to get through that first week.
[01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:22.340]   And again, if you can get through that first week,
[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:24.260]   chances are quite a bit higher
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:26.260]   that you'll be able to maintain
[01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:29.100]   the cessation of smoking or vaping.
[01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:31.980]   And of course, hypnosis, things like buprenparone
[01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:33.260]   can also assist in that.
[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:36.220]   Buprenparone by way of increasing dopamine pharmacologically,
[01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:39.100]   hypnosis through changes in neural circuitry
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:40.340]   that aren't completely understood
[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:42.460]   but seem to involve a remapping
[01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:44.780]   of some of the so-called default networks
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:46.380]   and some of the networks that are involved
[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:48.880]   in kind of understanding of your own internal state.
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:50.020]   This stuff gets a little bit complicated
[01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:52.940]   and we're going to return to this in an upcoming episode
[01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:54.140]   of the "Huberman Lab Podcast."
[01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:56.840]   But there are indeed legitimate changes
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:47:59.680]   in neural circuitry caused by clinical hypnosis
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:02.940]   that can at least partially explain why it is so effective
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:07.020]   in helping treat or allow people to stop smoking and vaping.
[01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:09.880]   So for those of you out there that either hear
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:14.500]   or are saying yourselves, "I just can't seem to quit smoking
[01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:17.280]   or vaping or dipping or snuffing,"
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:18.880]   hopefully an understanding
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:21.280]   of how that homeostasis process works
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:23.440]   and the time course of nicotine,
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:25.160]   depending on the delivery device,
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:27.400]   hopefully understanding that will allow you
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:29.880]   to develop a protocol.
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:30.960]   Maybe it involves hypnosis.
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:33.800]   Maybe it involves just understanding that the typical times
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:36.820]   in which you ingested nicotine
[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:38.340]   through any of the different approaches
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:40.020]   of bringing it into your system
[01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:41.300]   are going to be particularly hard,
[01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:43.160]   but I don't just mean particularly hard.
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:44.000]   I mean particularly hard
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.080]   and you're going to need to do something specific
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:50.520]   to offset that decrease in overall autonomic arousal
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:52.160]   and dopamine, et cetera.
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:53.880]   Hopefully an understanding of that will allow you
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:55.020]   to get through that first week.
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:56.880]   And if you can make it past that first week,
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:59.700]   you stand a very good chance of never going back.
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:02.420]   However, I did consult with Dr. David Spiegel
[01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:04.340]   in anticipation of this episode.
[01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:08.480]   Regardless of the method that you used to quit smoking
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:10.900]   or vaping, snuffing or dipping,
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:16.560]   there's good evidence that a routine maybe once a month
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:20.800]   or even once a week hypnosis type approach
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:23.480]   to replenish or even enhance the neural circuits
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:25.640]   that are allowing you to stay away from nicotine
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:27.080]   is going to be a very good idea.
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:31.400]   And given that it's a purely behavioral intervention,
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:34.000]   I can see no reason as to why people wouldn't want to do that.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.700]   Go in and reinforce, tighten the bolts on that circuitry
[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:39.840]   that are allowing you to not feel the impulse to smoke,
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:41.560]   not feel the impulse to vape.
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:43.840]   And just a very brief mention,
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:46.540]   there is a vast literature on the fact
[01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:48.820]   that when people have quit smoking or vaping
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:51.360]   or other form of consuming nicotine,
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:52.700]   that when they consume alcohol,
[01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:54.340]   there's a much higher probability of relapse.
[01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:56.160]   There are interactions between alcohol and nicotine
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.820]   that we'll cover in future episodes.
[01:49:57.820 --> 01:49:59.400]   But for those of you that want to quit,
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:00.740]   I want to assure you,
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:03.400]   despite the fact that 95% of people fail
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:04.980]   with the appropriate tools,
[01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:07.560]   and I like to think with an additional understanding
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.580]   of the underlying biology and psychology
[01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:11.880]   and what you can expect and when to really dig your heels
[01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:14.120]   and when to reinforce your system with more dopamine
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:16.160]   through any of the number of the different protocols
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:17.600]   and tools that we've offered here
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:18.680]   and that you can find elsewhere
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:21.200]   and other episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:22.940]   I have a high degree of confidence
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:27.640]   that you can quit smoking or vaping, dipping or snuffing.
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:29.820]   So today, typical of frankly all episodes
[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:30.840]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:34.680]   we've covered a lot about the biology of a particular system.
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:38.000]   We talked about the biology of nicotine in particular.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.120]   We talked about vaping and smoking, dipping and snuffing,
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:45.420]   and the negative health consequences associated with those.
[01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:48.860]   When I reemphasize that nicotine is not what causes cancer,
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:51.400]   it is the delivery device that causes cancer
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:53.440]   and the other negative health effects.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:56.440]   That is not to say that people should be ingesting nicotine
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:57.360]   through any different methods
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:58.840]   simply to get a cognitive boost.
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:00.160]   There are certain circumstances
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:03.440]   where that might be appropriate for the occasional work bout,
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:05.980]   certainly not for physical exercise,
[01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:07.640]   given what we talked about earlier.
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:09.840]   But of course, there are more and more approaches
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:12.040]   to increasing not just nicotine,
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:13.760]   but acetylcholine generally
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:15.360]   in order to achieve cognitive enhancement
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:16.520]   or physical enhancement,
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:19.300]   or I should say physical performance enhancement.
[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:22.000]   Some of those we talked about earlier, such as alpha-GPC.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.560]   In any event, nicotine, it should now be clear,
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:27.800]   is an immensely powerful substance,
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:30.480]   one of the most commonly ingested substances on the face
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:32.800]   of the earth and has been for a very long time.
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:34.820]   And now that you understand the underlying biology
[01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:36.960]   and the way in which it changes your psychology
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:39.740]   and physiology, that should come as no surprise.

[01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:12.400]   During today's episode and on various previous episodes
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.560]   of the Huberman Lab podcast, we talk about supplements.
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:16.520]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:18.500]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:21.600]   for things like enhancing sleep, hormone function,
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:22.880]   focus, and so on.
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:24.280]   The Huberman Lab podcast has partnered
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:28.120]   with Momentous Supplements, spelled Momentous O-U-S.
[01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:29.480]   You can find those supplements

[01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:43.740]   that you can use to enhance sleep, for instance,
[01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:45.280]   or enhance dopamine.
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:46.840]   We talk about deliberate cold exposure,
[01:52:46.840 --> 01:52:47.860]   deliberate heat exposure.

[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:14.600]   I describe science and science-related tools,
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:16.320]   some of which overlap with the content
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:17.680]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:20.060]   much of which is distinct from the content covered
[01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:21.620]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:23.800]   So once again, I'd like to thank you for joining me today
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:25.560]   for a discussion about the biology
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:27.440]   and psychological effects of nicotine,
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:29.200]   this incredibly powerful substance.
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:32.260]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:34.840]   [upbeat music]
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:37.420]   (upbeat music)
