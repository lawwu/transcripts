[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.940]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement
[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.180]   you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.600]   My name is Joshua Sheets. I'm your host and today I want to create a show
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.500]   specifically talking about what to do when you are facing financial disaster and
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.940]   catastrophe. Now in yesterday's show I talked about the meltdown at the cryptocurrency exchange
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.040]   FTX and I was very aware that it was affecting, it is affecting
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.220]   lots of people. It's a huge
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.120]   catastrophe for many and I know that there are many in my audience who are being affected.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.460]   But I just kind of shared off the cuff a few basic very quick things
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.380]   that I hoped would be useful and helpful to you. I had several listeners write to me simply saying
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.360]   thank you so much for the short comments that I made and how much they helped and I want to
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.200]   take today's show and speak directly to you and
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.640]   amplify those comments. I want to give you a broad perspective
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.600]   on what to do when you're facing
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.080]   financial catastrophe, when you've lost all your money, when
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.280]   all your funds have disappeared, when something bad has happened. I want to give you a broad perspective on this.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.600]   I want to speak directly to you and give you some useful and actionable and practical advice.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.360]   And so this is applicable if FTX, you know, if you're wiped out in FTX and you've lost your life savings
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.800]   and now you're completely penniless, this is applicable. If your business has collapsed for some other reason, this is applicable in many
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.800]   circumstances and many situations. So I want you to
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.880]   sit back, relax and
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.600]   listen because this is going to help you.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.720]   To begin with
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.240]   we need to start by putting the money in perspective.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.940]   This is the most important thing for us to begin with. You have to put money into perspective.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.120]   Financial catastrophe is a big deal.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:46.840]   It is going to dramatically affect your life in many many ways. It is important.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.800]   It is exceedingly important.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.000]   Bankruptcy, poverty, etc. These things affect lives.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.760]   But it is in no way the worst catastrophe that can happen to you.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.040]   What I'm about to say is going to sound exceedingly insensitive.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.200]   But I believe that in the fullness of time you will come to recognize that it is true.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.000]   If you have money problems and
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.240]   money problems alone
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.000]   you don't really have that many problems.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.960]   There's an old saying that if we all came into a room and we took all of our problems off of our backs and we
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.760]   put them on the floor together
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.320]   and said, "Okay, you can pick whichever problems up from this pile that you want."
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.920]   Most of us would probably walk over and get our own problems, the ones that we're accustomed to and
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.720]   be happy then that we have those problems.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.920]   I genuinely deeply believe that if you only have money problems
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.800]   you don't actually have that big of a problem.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.360]   Because not only are money problems...
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:14.200]   Where do I use? I'm gonna say fake for right now, and I'm gonna expand on that and clarify.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.000]   Not only are money problems fake,
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.200]   but they are some of the simplest, most straightforward problems to solve.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.920]   Because I can lay out for you the plan of how to solve them and you will be able to solve them.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.640]   No matter how bad and catastrophic your situation is today, for whatever reason,
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.400]   I promise you that you can lay out a roadmap to where you can solve those problems.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.200]   And in the course of human history, if you know what to do, even if the road is difficult,
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.000]   knowing what to do and knowing that there is a road means that you can walk down it.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.400]   The worst problems to face are the ones that are unsolvable.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.600]   And money problems are always solvable.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   The world is full of unsolvable problems.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:23.200]   The ones that affect us the most in our personal life usually involve relationships and health problems.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:30.000]   Relationships such as marriages that are going awry, relationships with our children that are not healthy,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.200]   health problems where you're ill, a loved one is ill,
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:42.000]   you're watching your child self-destruct and go off on a dangerous and deadly path.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.400]   There are many more, but those are the ones that usually cut to us the most.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.200]   And those problems are the most difficult because they are often unsolvable.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.400]   You may have a child who is grown, you have no legal authority over your child,
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   thus you can't force anything on your child.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.000]   Your child is 20-something years old and yet he's going off in a stupid direction,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.800]   destroying his life, very likely to end in death.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   There are few things in life that are more painful than those situations.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.000]   And what makes them exceedingly painful is that there's nothing you can do.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And yet you have to watch those things play out.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.800]   Or watching a loved one suffer from a deadly illness over the course of years,
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.800]   knowing that this illness is going to result in death.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Even in those situations, you can find joy, you can find redemption,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.600]   you can find God's faithfulness in the middle of them.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:59.000]   I think of a close friend of mine a number of years ago, she had a son,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.400]   and the son had muscular dystrophy.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.600]   And it started to present itself, he became aware of it at the age of some years old,
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.600]   four or five years old, something like that, after he had started to have trouble walking.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.800]   And I was close to the family for ten years,
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.200]   and they knew that this particular kind of muscular dystrophy was going to result in death.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.800]   And every day you have to watch, in their case, the son,
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.200]   in my case a young boy that I knew, but I was close,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.400]   you have to watch this medical condition advance,
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.000]   knowing that absent a divine intervention, it's going to result in death.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And that's what happened, died at 15 years old.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.600]   That's hard.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:51.000]   Health situations, relationship situations, I've had friends whose children committed suicide.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.400]   It happens to all of us, right? All of us know these things, we know people in them.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:04.200]   If you are asked, if you, let me just ask you,
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   no matter how great the financial catastrophe that you are facing right now is,
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   no matter how desperate it is, would you, right now, take all of your money back
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   if it meant the loss of your child over a very long and painful ten-year journey?
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.800]   The loss of your wife over a long and painful ten-year journey?
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   The loss of your own health, watching yourself deteriorate with some degenerative disease?
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   If there were a health factor involved, would you spend all of your money trying to get your health back?
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.400]   Now, my point is not to say that those situations are hopeless, they're not.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.800]   Again, there is redemption, there is encouragement, etc. in those situations.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   My point is simply to say that whenever I have a money problem,
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   or whenever I am coaching or counseling somebody who has a money problem,
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   let's first get this straight, it's just money.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.800]   Sounds insensitive to say it, but it's just money.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   The next thing that we need to be clear on is you will be able to continue living your life.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:37.800]   You will be able to rebuild everything, and you will face nothing like the challenges of the past.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   If you're living in the year 2022, and you've lost all of your money,
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   and you've experienced financial catastrophe, be grateful that you live in the year 2022.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   Because I promise you, you're not going to go hungry, you're not going to die of exposure,
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:06.800]   your children are not going to go naked, you will be able to do all of the things that you want to do.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.800]   I promise you. If you're listening to my voice, that is the case.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.800]   Everywhere in the world, right now there are still many people who will go hungry.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.800]   There are many places in the world where if you do not pay a debt, you'll still go to prison today.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.800]   But in the Western world, we've made tremendous progress,
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.800]   and you are going to be insulated from most of those most dire consequences.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.800]   So be grateful.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.800]   Throughout human history, going broke, losing all your money,
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   has very frequently resulted in the starvation of you and your family, your homelessness.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   And so, recognize that although what you're going to go through is going to be very intense,
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.800]   it's not the end of the world. It's not the end of the world.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:05.800]   And on the other side of this, you are going to emerge victorious.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.800]   You are going to emerge with a story. You are going to emerge with hard-won experience.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   You are going to emerge wiser, more experienced,
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   and you're going to have something to share with others that will be helpful.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   Your situation is not unique. The particular circumstances are.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   But the idea of making a bad investment, taking a risk and losing it all,
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.800]   opening a business and having it fail,
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   these things are normal throughout human history.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.800]   And many, many wealthy, powerful, and influential men have come before you,
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.800]   have gone through what you are going through,
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.800]   and have emerged victorious on the other side.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.800]   You can do this too.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   Sounds trite, but I repeat it. It helps me.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.800]   I'm going to give you a bunch of stuff that helps me.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   You pick and choose from what helps you, but I'm going to tell you what helps me.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.800]   Whenever I'm going through a particularly miserable situation,
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.800]   I simply try to remind myself,
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.800]   "This is going to give me one of the world's best stories on the other side of it."
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   You're out camping in the wilderness, and it's freezing cold,
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.800]   and your tent is... water is billowing in the side of your tent,
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   and you're sitting there with nothing to do in the middle of the night.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   Cold, wet, hungry, miserable, freezing.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.800]   I just tell myself, "This sucks. This sucks big time."
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.800]   I am going to be telling this story for the rest of my life,
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.800]   about this particular time.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.800]   And you'll be able to laugh about it on the other side.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.800]   So if you know that you're going to be able to laugh about it at some point,
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.800]   then try to put it in its proper place now.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:50.800]   Recognize that... just put it in its proper place now.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.800]   Next point.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.800]   Money is fake.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.800]   It's all made up.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   We print this stuff on sheets of fabric,
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   and then we spend our lives chasing it.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   The balances in your investments, the balances in your portfolio,
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.800]   they're digits printed on a screen.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   All of the profits that you had in your trading portfolio,
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   all the profits you had in your mutual fund account,
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   all these profits, they're all fake.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.800]   It's just made up.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.800]   Now, it's not that they don't have real utility and real use.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.800]   Obviously, they do.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.800]   My point is that it was never really real in the first place.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:42.800]   The implosion of FTX is obviously a spectacular catastrophe.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.800]   But I want you to imagine that it doesn't stop there.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.800]   I want you to imagine that every single cryptocurrency invented
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   over the last 10 years goes to zero.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   I want you to imagine that Bitcoin goes to zero.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.800]   It was always fake.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   Once you recognize that, you can realize that, you know what?
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   It's all fake.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   That means that the loss of it is purely a mental game.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   And what I want to emphasize is that most financial problems
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.800]   are far more a mental game than anything else.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:32.800]   And so your number one goal to escape your problems
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.800]   is to discipline and control your brain.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   The good thing about this is
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.800]   that's literally the only thing you can do in life.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   You can't actually control anything else in the world.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.800]   The only thing that you have absolute control over is your brain.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:02.800]   And so you can choose the story that you tell yourself.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   You can choose the meaning and the impact.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.800]   You can choose the thoughts that you think,
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.800]   the things that you consider.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   You are the master of your brain.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.800]   And it is the only thing in the world that you can master.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.800]   So when you look at your financial catastrophe,
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.800]   your experience of coming out the other side
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.800]   is going to be driven 100%
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.800]   by the thoughts that you hold in front of yourself,
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.800]   the thoughts that you allow to be in your mind.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.800]   There are many paths that you can take,
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:47.800]   and a middle path of some kind is almost certain to be the correct path.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.800]   But let me lay out two paths on the extremes.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.800]   And I want you to recognize that both of these are accessible to you.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.800]   First, the path of doom and gloom and surrender.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.800]   You can look down at your life and you can say,
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.800]   "I've lost all my money.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.800]   My business failed.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.800]   My crypto is gone.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   I've lost all my money.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   Life is never going to be the same.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   I had this taste of what it was like to be wealthy
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.800]   for a very short period of time,
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   and now it's all gone."
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.800]   And let's assume that you lever it up.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.800]   Margin is wiping you out.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   You've got debt all over the place.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.800]   Let's assume that you are completely and utterly and entirely destroyed, 100%.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:41.800]   You can allow that
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.800]   to cause you to think thoughts of failure,
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   depression, darkness.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   You can see yourself as a failure.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.800]   You can nurse those thoughts.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.800]   You can imagine how your life is all going to fall apart.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.800]   Your wife is going to leave you.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   Your children are going to hate you.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.800]   You're going to go out there and you're going to end it all.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   Might as well just delete yourself from the face of the earth.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.800]   After all, it's never going to get better.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.800]   That's the path that, unfortunately, many are probably going to go down.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   You see this and virtually all collapses.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.800]   It's very pronounced in honor societies.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   It's less pronounced in societies like the United States,
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.800]   kind of Western culture, where we're not so much an honor society.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   But it happens.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.800]   And you can start that black spiral.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:37.800]   If you feed yourself those thoughts, that's where you're going to end up.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.800]   On the other hand, you can feed yourself the positive thoughts.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.800]   You get to choose.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.800]   For me, the phrase that is beat into my head is,
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.800]   "Failure is an event. It's not a person."
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.800]   Failure is an event. It's not a person.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.800]   I am not a failure.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   I simply failed.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.800]   And guess what? Failure is normal.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.800]   It's normal, especially among high-achieving people.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   You can win or you can learn.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.800]   You can learn the lessons from the catastrophe that you're facing.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.800]   And you can go on and you can live to fight another day.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   And you can choose the path that the future has.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:32.800]   If you have your health, if you have your family,
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.800]   if you have people that love you,
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.800]   if you have the ability to go and work,
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.800]   be it physical work or mental work, etc.,
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.800]   all of these things are available to you.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.800]   You have everything that you need to start again.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   And the next time, you'll do it faster, better, and more safely.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   And you can put this in front of yourself as one of the ultimate challenges.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:00.800]   What I like to do is simply pay attention to people who've lost it all and rebuilt it all.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   My favorite example to use in the personal finance community is simply Dave Ramsey.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.800]   Dave's story is remarkable.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   He was flying high and he lost it all.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:18.800]   He fought for years along the process of losing it all to stave off bankruptcy.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.800]   Eventually, he was forced into bankruptcy by his creditors,
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.800]   declared bankruptcy, and had to rebuild everything from nothing.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.800]   And yet, that story, the catastrophe,
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.800]   wound up being the very thing that allowed him to rebuild everything.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.800]   And the same is possible for you.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:45.800]   This story of your personal catastrophe may be the very thing that allows you to rebuild everything.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   I don't know how, but I promise it's available to you.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   Let's pivot to some practical items, and we'll come back to the mindset.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   But I want to show you what's available to you from the practical perspective.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.800]   First thing is this.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.800]   When you suffer a great financial loss,
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   in almost all circumstances, your external life doesn't have to change all that much right now.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   There are some people for whom it does.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   If you had a big business and you were spending a million dollars a year,
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   living a high lifestyle, and your business completely imploded,
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.800]   you're probably going to have to change if you're going through bankruptcy.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   But many people, especially many people who are hurt by the FTX implosion,
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.800]   many people, they'd never built those profits into their life.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   You've lost your trading account.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.800]   You've lost your nest egg.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:44.800]   But you probably haven't lost, you probably weren't already changing to living on that.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.800]   If you were, there will be lifestyle effects.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.800]   First thing to do is to sit down and look at your current expenses.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.800]   Pull out a sheet of paper.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   Write down an up-to-date balance sheet.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.800]   Figure out where you are today.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.800]   Go through your bank accounts.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.800]   Go through your crypto reserves.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   Go through your assets.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.800]   Write down everything that you own.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.800]   Everything that you have control over.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   Everything that you could sell.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   Make a complete list of all of your assets.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.800]   Include everything.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.800]   Everything, again, from investments, 401k, house.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.800]   Go through your house.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.800]   If you have a fancy watch collection or expensive golf clubs you could sell or a gun collection, etc.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.800]   Make a complete list of your assets.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.800]   Number two, make a complete list of your liabilities.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   Who do you owe and what do you owe them?
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.800]   Make a complete list and while you're making that list,
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   ask yourself what kind of debt this is.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.800]   Is this a mortgage where somebody has a claim on my house?
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.800]   Is this a credit card where it's an unsecured debt
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.800]   but eventually they could sue me if I don't pay them?
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   Is this an account to a person, etc.?
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.800]   Go through all your debts.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   Is it a car loan, etc.?
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.800]   Make a complete list.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.800]   Then number three, go through your expenses
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.800]   and write down all of your necessary expenses.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.800]   Your current monthly living expenses.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   This exercise is often exceedingly difficult to do
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.800]   because it requires you to face reality.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.800]   But if you will do it, no matter how bad the numbers are,
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.800]   on the other side of it you will feel better
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.800]   because you took action.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.800]   I've experienced this myself straight up.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.800]   You're in a mess.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.800]   Business is failing, income's kind of there, etc.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.800]   You're hiding all of your problems and debt.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.800]   You come across and you say, "Ah, you know what?
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.800]   I should go do that but I don't want to face the facts.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   I don't want to look at the numbers."
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   Then you go and you face the facts and you look at the numbers
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.800]   and no matter how bad it is,
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.800]   you're going to feel better on the other side
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.800]   because the numbers will answer your questions for you.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   When you don't put the numbers on paper,
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.800]   you're going to be lost in a black haze of uncertainty.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.800]   The black cloud will be there and you won't know what to do.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   But when you put the numbers on paper,
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.800]   your path forward is going to be evident to you.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.800]   It's going to show you what you need to do.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.800]   So put all the numbers on paper,
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.800]   all of your assets, all of your liabilities,
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   and write out your living expenses,
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.800]   especially required payments.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.800]   This is the start of basically a budget.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.800]   If you currently have income,
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.800]   write down how much that income is.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.800]   If you don't have income,
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.800]   at least you'll know how much income you need to start generating.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:02.800]   In many cases, just doing this will show you
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   that although you've suffered a serious setback,
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.800]   no question about it,
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   life is not terminal.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.800]   Imagine you're a guy, right,
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   you're making $100,000, living in the suburbs,
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.800]   married, three children, two children.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   You got $200,000 in your 401k.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.800]   You started off with $100,000 in your crypto account.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.800]   You blew it up to a million three,
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.800]   and now it was all on FTX and you lost a million three.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   Well, you were still working.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.800]   You lost a lot of money.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   That stinks.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.800]   But you also didn't have that money three years ago.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.800]   It was all fake.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   It was paper profits.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.800]   It was all fake.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.800]   So you can live to fight again.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.800]   What do you still have?
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.800]   You have a house, you got a wife, you got children, you got a job.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.800]   You probably are not going to see any outward expression or change
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   on your lifestyle.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   You can still keep your children in school,
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.800]   you can still feed your family, etc.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   Everything's still available.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.800]   You're going to be fine.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.800]   What I'm trying to show you is that
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.800]   this isn't going to be mental.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   You're going to choose the story you tell yourself,
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.800]   and it's all in your head.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:29.800]   The single biggest impact of losing money,
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   having a business failure, etc.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.800]   is the story that you tell yourself.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:40.800]   It's all in your head.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.800]   It's not in actuality.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.800]   It's not real.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.800]   It's the story that you tell yourself.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.800]   The thing that drives people crazy
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   when they lose a bunch of money
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   is they spend all their time thinking about
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   what could have been
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.800]   instead of what is.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.800]   But if you'll just simply focus on what is
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.800]   and what is real,
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   you can adapt to that.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.800]   In life, human beings are very, very adaptable.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.800]   In the personal finance world,
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.800]   we usually talk about this on the upside,
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   where we talk about so-called hedonic adaptation.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.800]   The idea being you get used to a fancy lifestyle,
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.800]   you get used to nicer things,
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.800]   and very quickly it's just normal for you.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.800]   You go from a cheap old apartment
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.800]   to a nice big fancy house,
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.800]   and that's normal for you.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.800]   The good news is that adaptation
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   can happen up,
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   it can also happen down.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.800]   You can very quickly adapt yourself
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.800]   to difficulty,
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.800]   lack of comfort, etc.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.800]   And if you'll maintain your brain
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.800]   to focus on what is wonderful about that,
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.800]   you will be fine.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.800]   I want to insert a small rabbit trail here
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.800]   to talk to those of us
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.800]   who perhaps haven't lost all of our money
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.800]   in the last few days.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.800]   Because I believe that training
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.800]   for the loss of all your money
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.800]   is actually a valuable tool of preparation.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.800]   And what I like to do
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.800]   is not only play mental games, war games,
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.800]   with it, but actually test it out.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.800]   And long-time listeners have heard me say this repeatedly,
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.800]   try out different things
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.800]   to see what it's actually like.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.800]   One of my favorite experiences
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.800]   of the past few years of my life
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   was when I took my family traveling in an RV.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   And I did that
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   because I wanted to go in an RV with my family.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.800]   I thought it sounded like fun.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   I always wanted to try out
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.800]   the perpetual traveler nomad lifestyle.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.800]   And I wanted to show my wife and I
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.800]   hadn't traveled much, we'd been having babies,
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   it was inconvenient,
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   it just seemed like a great thing to do.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.800]   I wanted to try living and working on the road.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   I did it on the cheap.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.800]   I bought a,
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   round number is a $6,000 travel trail
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   and a $6,000 pickup truck.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.800]   I loved it.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.800]   I loved it.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   And one of the things I loved about it
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.800]   was seeing
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.800]   how much I could enjoy
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.800]   a very simple, minimalist lifestyle.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.800]   We had a 30-foot travel trailer,
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.800]   bunkhouse travel trailer,
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.800]   queen-size bedroom up front,
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.800]   four bunks in the back for the children,
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   little tiny living room area,
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.800]   little tiny kitchen,
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.800]   little tiny bathroom,
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.800]   little tiny dinette, that was it.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.800]   Cheap old trailer.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.800]   One of my favorite places to be
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   was in that front bedroom
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.800]   because it just felt so cozy.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   And some nights we would be parked
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   in a spectacular location.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   I'd get up in the morning,
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.800]   open up the shades,
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.800]   look out the window and just think,
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.800]   wow, I get to sit here and look at this.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   Some nights we'd park in a parking lot,
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.800]   Walmart parking lot,
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   little tiny living room area,
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.800]   cracker barrel, et cetera.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   I loved that just as much.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.800]   And what it showed me
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.800]   was simply how you can go
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   from a nice big house
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   and all of the joys of that
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   to something totally different
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.800]   and enjoy all of the joys of that.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   And that's a skill
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   that I think is worth practicing.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.800]   I love nice houses, big houses,
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   all the amenities, et cetera.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.800]   But if you only ever
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.800]   can experience and enjoy nice things,
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   you're a very weak person.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.800]   You don't have to have all that
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   to enjoy it.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.800]   And so let's talk about another example.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.800]   Let's say you've lost all your money.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.800]   Let's say you wake up,
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.800]   you've lost literally all your money.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.800]   You have no, you have nothing, right?
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   A few hundred dollars here and there.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   You had everything at FTX
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   or whatever it was.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.800]   You had to put it all in your business
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   and your business has collapsed.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:05.800]   Not only that,
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.800]   but you have bills,
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.800]   but you can't make those bills, right?
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.800]   You're not gonna, a few months from now,
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.800]   you're not gonna be in your apartment
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   or a few months from now
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   the mortgage company's gonna foreclose
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.800]   on the house, et cetera.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.800]   And you're gonna be left with nothing.
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.800]   You're gonna wind up literally homeless.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.800]   But you know what?
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.800]   Even if you were quite literally homeless,
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.800]   and I mean,
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.800]   when I say literally,
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.800]   I don't mean non-literally
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.800]   literally homeless.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.800]   Guess what?
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.800]   You can live better
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.800]   and you can live well today.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.800]   You can live better today
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.800]   as someone who is quite literally homeless
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.800]   than in many cases
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.800]   the wealthiest person in the world
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.800]   could have a century ago.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.800]   I call it my tent experiment.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   If I went literally homeless,
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.800]   first thing I would do
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.800]   would be to get my hands on a tent.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.800]   A nice one, like a nice wall tent,
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.800]   something comfortable to be in,
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.800]   put some cots in there, et cetera.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.800]   But if my family and I wound up
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.800]   in a 10 by 20 wall tent
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.800]   with a bunch of cots,
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.800]   do you know how amazing
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.800]   the world we live in is today?
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   If we're cold,
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.800]   I can get a heater.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   50 bucks, 100 bucks, grab a heater,
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.800]   tank of propane,
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.800]   little wood stove to go in the tent.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   If you don't have any of this stuff
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   and you have literally no money,
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   your friends will help you out,
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   your family members will help you out.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.800]   They'll lend you a few bucks
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.800]   and you can get yourself a wood stove
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.800]   for your tent.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.800]   You can be warm.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.800]   You won't die of exposure to the cold
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.800]   as millions have throughout history.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   You're not going to go hungry.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.800]   You can go today to any grocery store
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.800]   in the United States
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.800]   and for 20 bucks
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.800]   you can buy enough food
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.800]   to feed your family for a couple of days.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.800]   How do you do it?
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   Buy flour,
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.800]   buy a bottle of olive oil,
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.800]   buy a little thing of salt.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.800]   If you can afford it,
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   buy a jar of peanut butter
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.800]   and a jar of jelly.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.800]   But flour, salt, oil,
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.800]   you got calories,
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.800]   you can fill your children's stomachs,
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.800]   you can eat for pennies a day.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.800]   Not only that,
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.800]   but of course your town
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.800]   has an abundance of food pantries,
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.800]   free food,
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   set-aside for you
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.800]   in your time of need.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   You can apply for food assistance programs
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   where you'll be able to feed yourself
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   and your family
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.800]   with other great food from the grocery store.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.800]   There are friends,
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.800]   people around who in your time of need
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.800]   will be happy to step in and support you.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.800]   Barring that,
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.800]   go dumpster diving.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   You'll find all the food that you need
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.800]   right from the dumpsters in your local area.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.800]   Plenty available.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   You're not going to starve.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   In terms of everything else,
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.800]   grab yourself a battery,
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.800]   grab yourself a little solar panel.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.800]   If you got one,
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.800]   a little generator,
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.800]   charge a battery from someone else's.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.800]   If you got a cell phone,
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   you need a cell phone,
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.800]   but you got free Wi-Fi at your local library.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   You got free Wi-Fi everywhere these days.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   You got a free computer at your local library.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.800]   All kinds of stuff.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.800]   With that,
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.800]   you have the world's knowledge at your fingertips.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   All the books basically ever written
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.800]   for free available to you.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   You need to cook,
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   grab yourself a camping stove.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   You need light.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.800]   It's all available.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.800]   We like to joke about glamping,
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.800]   but one of the things that's remarkable about glamping
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.800]   is how convenient everything is.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.800]   The last missing piece, by the way,
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.800]   has been solved now.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.800]   Starlink.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   Starlink is in the middle of revolutionizing the world.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   I used to think about this
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   because I came across years ago
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   this story of a coder, a programmer
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   who was living in a tent in the woods
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   and he was a programmer working on his own thing
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   instead of working for a company to make his bills.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.800]   He was, I think, tethering to a cell phone,
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   but of course that was difficult a few years ago.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   If you go and you look at his system,
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.800]   today you can live so well.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.800]   I know this is a bit of a rabbit hole,
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.800]   but I just want to encourage you
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.800]   that even if you were literally homeless,
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.800]   if you've got a few thousand dollars,
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   if I woke up and I was literally homeless,
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.800]   had lost everything,
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   and I had four or five thousand bucks,
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.800]   I'd go buy a nice tent.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.800]   They call them solar generators, bad name,
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.800]   but battery system to run on,
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.800]   that I can use to run my lights.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.800]   You can use to run electronics, et cetera.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.800]   I have electricity.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   I'd buy a nice camp stove,
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   bunch of bottles of propane,
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   grab some coolers to keep my food cold,
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   and go set up a camp in the woods.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.800]   This is the normal human experience,
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   and we're so far from this in our modern world,
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.800]   and yet it's all in our head.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   It's all, and what I'm trying to drive at
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   is to show you that this is in your head.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.800]   Throughout virtually all of human civilization,
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   this is how people lived.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.800]   They slept on the ground with nothing,
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   and this was a century ago or less.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.800]   I always think about this,
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   you remember the story in the Bible of Jacob,
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   when he is traveling,
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.800]   he ran away from his brother Esau
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   after taking his brother's birthright,
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   and he's traveling to his uncle's house.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   Remember it says what he used for a pillow
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.800]   when he was traveling?
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.800]   A stone, right?
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.800]   I love that because this is the classic example.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.800]   Here's a guy who's traveling.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.800]   It means a dude wearing a robe
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   or a blanket around his shoulders,
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.800]   a small bag of some things he can carry,
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   and when it gets cold at night,
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.800]   he lies down on the ground,
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.800]   and he pulls up a stone for a pillow.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   Fast forward.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.800]   I've been listening to,
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.800]   with my children,
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   reading the Lord of the Rings.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.800]   We've been listening to the audiobooks.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.800]   By the way, if you don't have it,
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.800]   get the Andy Serkis recordings
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   of the Lord of the Rings.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   It is the best audiobook I've ever listened to.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   Incredible actor.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   It's better than reading it yourself,
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   and I don't usually say that about audiobooks.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.800]   We've been listening through it as a family.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.800]   We're in the second book right now,
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.800]   and we're off on this journey,
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.800]   and what I do is I picture how they were traveling.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.800]   Now, they had, in some cases,
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.800]   basically, you most of the time
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   just have what they could carry,
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.800]   but recognize that when they lay down at night,
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.800]   they didn't have a tent.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.800]   They had a blanket that they rolled up in.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.800]   That's it.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.800]   That's how they lived.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   Go back to the far west,
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   in the cowboys,
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.800]   which you see in a western.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.800]   What does a cowboy have?
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   He's got a bed roll,
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.800]   blanket,
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   little canvas cover he can put down on the ground,
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.800]   lies down around the fire,
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.800]   sleeps in the open air.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.800]   To this day,
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.800]   there are millions,
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.800]   hundreds of millions of people around the world
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.800]   who are still living like this.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.800]   Want to go to sleep?
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   You lie down on the floor in the corner.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.800]   My dad told me stories.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.800]   My dad grew up in the mountains of Colorado,
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.800]   and his family was in California.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.800]   This would have been back in the 1950s, I think,
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.800]   and so they would drive back and forth on occasion.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.800]   I don't know if it was annually or biannually,
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.800]   something like that,
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.800]   between Colorado and California.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.800]   They didn't stop at a hotel
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.800]   and pay $100 a night for a holiday in Express.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.800]   They drove along the desert.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.800]   When they got tired at night,
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   they pulled the car off into the desert.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   My grandmother would sleep in the backseat of the car.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   The men would go and lie down on the ground
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   and sleep.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.800]   In the morning, they'd wake up,
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.800]   get back in the car, and go on their way.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.800]   You can do this.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.800]   Just share a personal story.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.800]   About 10 years ago,
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.800]   more than that, 12 or 13 years ago,
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.800]   I went and I spent a month in the Philippines.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.800]   We were traveling, doing some missionary work,
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.800]   preaching in some very remote churches
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.800]   in the middle of nowhere
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.800]   with some very poor people.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.800]   For an entire month,
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   I didn't see a bed.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.800]   I slept on the ground like everyone.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   That is very normal
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   in the rural Filipino culture
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   where we were.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.800]   Usually,
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   the local people would sleep
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.800]   in what's called a nipah hut
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   in the local parlance
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   which has soft bamboo floors.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   I wound up sleeping on a plank floor
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   with nothing.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   They usually have mats.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   I think I got a little braided mat
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.800]   at some point in time.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.800]   The first couple days,
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   the hardship was sore.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.800]   After a few days, I adapted.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.800]   I spent a month sleeping on a hardwood floor,
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.800]   plank floor, nothing.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.800]   I adapted, got used to it.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.800]   One of the things is recognize
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.800]   that even if you lost it all,
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.800]   you wouldn't lose it all.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   You would be fine.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   You'd be able to rebuild.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.800]   You'll figure out a way.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.800]   I'm using that extreme circumstance
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   for a reason.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   If we start with the worst case scenario,
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.800]   you'll see that every step up is better.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.800]   I don't want to go and sleep
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.800]   on a tent in the forest if I can avoid it.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.800]   I'll go and buy an RV.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.800]   I'd rather be in an RV
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.800]   than in a tent in the forest.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   If I can't have an RV,
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.800]   I'll go and I'll get a $500 a month apartment.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.800]   It may not be great,
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.800]   but it's better than the tent in the forest.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   More convenient.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.800]   You just systematically upgrade.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   Hopefully, what I can do
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.800]   is just change your perspective a little bit.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.800]   The vast majority of us
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.800]   who lose it all,
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.800]   lose a bad investment, et cetera,
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   we're never going to wind up
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.800]   in that hardcore scenario.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.800]   You probably can keep your home.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.800]   You've got months to figure it out.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.800]   Let's say that you're facing foreclosure
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.800]   because you don't have any money
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.800]   you lost at all.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   They're not going to kick you out
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.800]   for at least several months.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.800]   That gives you time.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.800]   You can go get a job.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.800]   You may not be able to pay everything.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.800]   You may not be able to pay the car,
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.800]   the truck, kids, private tuition, et cetera,
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   but you could probably at least pay your mortgage.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   Buck up. You're going to be fine.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.800]   Recognize how bad it could be.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.800]   Then you'll be more grateful
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   for the fact that you're not there.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.800]   If you think that you're there,
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   recognize that even there
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   is probably pretty good.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   Next, when you're thinking
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.800]   about the assets that you have,
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:35.800]   recognize that those assets include people.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   If you're a normal person
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.800]   with normal relationships,
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.800]   you probably have a huge network of people
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   that would be thrilled to help you.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:53.800]   What would keep you from accessing that help?
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:57.800]   Answer is your pride.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.800]   That's what will keep you from it.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:03.800]   Once again, we come down to the fact
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.800]   that this is all a mental game.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.800]   If you're proud that you're not there,
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.800]   if you're proud and unwilling to admit
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   that you made a mistake,
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.800]   it's going to be a long and difficult road.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   If you can simply own up to yourself
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.800]   and recognize, "I screwed up.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   I made a mistake."
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   Or if you didn't make a mistake,
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   maybe you didn't make a mistake
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.800]   and the market was against you.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   I don't think you're stupid for trusting FTX.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.800]   I don't think you should think you're stupid either.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.800]   By all accounts, this was a good business.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.800]   Would it have been great if you held your own keys?
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.800]   But even if you held your own keys,
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   there's still no guarantee.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.800]   Even if you never invested in some popular token,
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.800]   maybe you only invested in Bitcoin
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.800]   and you held all your own keys,
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.800]   there's no reason to say that Bitcoin itself
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.800]   doesn't go to zero.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   There's no guarantee.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   Don't play a game with yourself.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   Don't let yourself be shamed.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.800]   Just say, "I screwed up."
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   Or, "The market turned against me.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   I didn't do everything right in business."
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.800]   And the whole thing can come right against you.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.800]   Just imagine, right?
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.800]   Two years ago, you were running a great business.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.800]   The government comes in and shuts your doors
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   and says, "You can't have people here."
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.800]   And you did everything right.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.800]   You didn't make the pandemic
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   and they come in and they bankrupt you.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.800]   And they go on to make fun of you two years later
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   when you take out money from them shutting you down
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.800]   and they use you as a political pawn.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.800]   So the point is,
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   don't beat yourself up unnecessarily.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.800]   Maybe you could have avoided it
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.800]   if you'd held your own keys.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.800]   Yeah, but maybe you couldn't have.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.800]   Again, we don't know.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.800]   It's perfectly plausible
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.800]   that two years from today,
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.800]   Bitcoin would be completely worthless.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.800]   And all the people that are poking fun at you
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.800]   for having your money on FTX
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.800]   because you didn't hold your keys,
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.800]   they're also wiped out and totally broke.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.800]   So don't, just ignore them.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   Ignore that.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.800]   Recognize it's all in your head.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.800]   So humble yourself.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.800]   Humble yourself.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.800]   Acknowledge the mistake
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.800]   and you'll find around you
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.800]   or acknowledge the loss.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.800]   And you're going to find around you
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.800]   loads of people anxious to help you out.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   Why are you never going to end up
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.800]   in a tent in the forest?
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.800]   Because your parents would be thrilled
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.800]   to offer you their garage apartment.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.800]   There's no shame in taking it.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:34.800]   Your buddy will say,
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.800]   "Hey, I got a cheap car.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   Why don't you just take my car
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.800]   and drive it for six months?"
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   All of what you need
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.800]   to rebuild your life
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.800]   is at your fingertips.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.800]   As long as you can conquer
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.800]   the pride and the emotions
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.800]   and the craziness in your head,
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:02.800]   you'll be able to rebuild your life.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:05.800]   Next,
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.800]   if you're not currently employed,
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   then
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.800]   the most important step for you to take
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.800]   is to get a job.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.800]   As quickly as possible,
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.800]   get a job.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.800]   Most of you who have been wiped out
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.800]   probably are still employed.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.800]   So this advice
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.800]   affects most likely
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.800]   someone who's lost his business
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.800]   et cetera.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.800]   But if you're not currently employed,
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.800]   a job is going to change your world.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.800]   One of the biggest benefits of the job
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.800]   is going to be for your mental health.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.800]   As a man,
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.800]   you must work.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.800]   You will feel good
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.800]   when you are at work.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.800]   If you have work,
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.800]   you have a good,
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.800]   honest,
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:05.800]   upright,
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:06.800]   morally helpful work,
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   work that benefits society.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.800]   No matter how menial,
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.800]   you can find great meaning
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   and significance in your work.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.800]   Whatever job you take,
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.800]   it doesn't need to be
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.800]   the 10-year job.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.800]   You just need something.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.800]   Because something,
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:27.800]   even if you start from nothing,
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   some kind of income
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:31.800]   will make decisions.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:35.800]   The most difficult place
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.800]   to be in from a financial perspective
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   is unemployed.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   Because
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.800]   if you don't have any revenue
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.800]   coming into your household,
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.800]   then you can't know
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:48.800]   what decision is right.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.800]   You can't know whether you can afford
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.800]   $2,000 a month of rent
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.800]   or $500 a month of rent
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.800]   or $0 a month of rent.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.800]   Thus, you can't tell whether you should go
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:00.800]   to a remote wilderness to live in
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.800]   or whether you should go
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:03.800]   to your dad's garage apartment
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.800]   or to his garage
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.800]   and put your tent inside of it
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:07.800]   or whether you should go to
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   the local
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   rent-by-the-week hotel room
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.800]   or whether you should go
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:16.800]   and get a perfectly ordinary apartment
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.800]   for $2,000 a month.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:19.800]   You don't know.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.800]   So you have to get a job.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.800]   And as soon as you have a job,
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.800]   you can start making those decisions intelligently.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.800]   And as your job changes,
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.800]   you can change all those situations.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.800]   The job will give you
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.800]   structure for your days.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.800]   It will allow you to not be alone,
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.800]   which is deadly for you.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.800]   It will allow you to produce in society
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.800]   and feel like you have
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.800]   an opportunity to contribute.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.800]   So you've got to get a job.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.800]   Now, you shouldn't just go out
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.800]   and get the first job, right?
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.800]   Check your runway.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:55.800]   This is why we go back to your assets
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.800]   and liabilities.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.800]   Maybe you quit your job
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.800]   and you're a full-time trader
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.800]   and now you've lost all your money
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   through a bad trade, right?
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.800]   You were day trading
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:02.800]   and boom, it's all gone.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.800]   Okay.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.800]   If you've got three months of runway,
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.800]   then do an intelligent job search.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.800]   You don't have to just go
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.800]   and take the first thing,
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.800]   but focus on it quickly.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.800]   Go after it.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   One of the biggest assets you have,
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   especially for my primarily American audience,
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.800]   is you have access
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:27.800]   to one of the world's biggest
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.800]   and most robust labor markets
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.800]   that is right now
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.800]   desperate for workers.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.800]   There are jobs galore available to you
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   in the United States.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.800]   So if you have the legal right
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:43.800]   to work in the United States
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   as a US citizen
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   or a resident of some kind
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   with a work visa,
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   you have everything you need
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:49.800]   to rebuild your financial life.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.800]   I promise you.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.800]   It's not always great.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.800]   You might be doing entry-level,
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.800]   but you have everything you need
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.800]   to rebuild your financial life.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.800]   And if you're listening to this podcast,
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.800]   that tells me
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.800]   that you're the kind of person
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.800]   that no matter where you start,
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:08.800]   six months from now,
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.800]   you can be far ahead
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   of where you start.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:14.800]   I'm convinced
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.800]   that a good, honest, hardworking person
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.800]   can go into any kind of just
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.800]   entry-level retail job
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:22.800]   and in six months
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:23.800]   be a manager of the place.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.800]   There is such a dearth
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.800]   of work ethic,
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.800]   responsibility,
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.800]   reliability,
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.800]   kindness,
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.800]   social skills, etc.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.800]   that if you just have normal,
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.800]   ordinary qualifications
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:41.800]   in those regards,
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.800]   you can completely separate yourself
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:44.800]   from the competition.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.800]   So get yourself a job.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.800]   If your job is very low income,
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.800]   let's assume that
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:54.800]   you find something
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:55.800]   and you're making $15 an hour.
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   It's going to be tough
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.800]   to make it on $15 an hour.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:03.800]   $15 an hour times 40 hours
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.800]   is $600 a week.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.800]   Hopefully you can get more than 40 hours,
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.800]   but $600 a week,
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.800]   that's $2,400 a month.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.800]   So let's assume that you started there.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.800]   Well, if that's all you got,
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.800]   then now at least you know
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:18.800]   what your budget is.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.800]   You know what you can do.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.800]   You ain't going out
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:22.800]   renting an apartment
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:23.800]   for $10,000 a month.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.800]   You're going to be possibly
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.800]   putting a tent in your dad's backyard.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.800]   But at least you have
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.800]   a starting place.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.800]   And you can go on
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:32.800]   and start making decisions.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.800]   So get to work.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.800]   Do not allow yourself
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:37.800]   to be alone.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.800]   And most importantly,
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.800]   do not allow yourself
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.800]   to be alone,
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.800]   sucked into the electronic vortex
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:44.800]   of a social media feed.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.800]   I find this to be
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.800]   a major problem in my own life.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.800]   If you fight against it,
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   80% success.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.800]   The 20% failures though,
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   make me miserable.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.800]   You sit there on Twitter
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.800]   following this thread,
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.800]   that thread,
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.800]   this thread,
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.800]   that thread,
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:04.800]   whatever your platform of choice is.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.800]   And it just,
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.800]   it makes you feel worse
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:08.800]   and worse and worse and worse.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.800]   Real life is not like that.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:13.800]   Real life is engaging.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.800]   And so one of your goals
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:16.800]   needs to be to get around people
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:17.800]   as much as possible.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.800]   Get around people at work,
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.800]   even get around people physically.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:24.800]   If you're single
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.800]   and you've lost everything,
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.800]   don't sit at home in your apartment.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   At least go to a coffee shop
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.800]   and work there,
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:32.800]   even if you don't buy anything,
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.800]   or go to a park,
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:35.800]   or just be around people
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:36.800]   so you don't feel isolated.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.800]   If you've got family,
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   wife, children, parents, whatever,
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:42.800]   get around them.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.800]   Get around friends
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:44.800]   as much as possible.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.800]   Be with real people
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.800]   who can look you in the face,
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:48.800]   commiserate with you,
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:49.800]   empathize with you,
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.800]   encourage you,
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.800]   slap you in the head.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.800]   Don't be around
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.800]   the digital hordes of people
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.800]   who you know nothing about,
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.800]   who pump into you
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.800]   nasty stuff.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:04.800]   Be around real people.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   Look at
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.800]   what you're going through
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:12.800]   as an opportunity
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:13.800]   to change everything.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:16.800]   One of the things that's interesting
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:17.800]   about life,
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:18.800]   people talk about,
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.800]   you've heard the old saying that,
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.800]   you know,
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:22.800]   the first million is the hardest.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.800]   I think it truly is.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.800]   And there's a real
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.800]   financial reason to it as well, right?
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:27.800]   Once you've got a million bucks,
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:28.800]   you can,
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:29.800]   the second million is going to be easier
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:30.800]   because you got a million dollars
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.800]   the first time,
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:32.800]   you can just do a lot more.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.800]   But one of the things that's interesting
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.800]   is I want you to reflect on your life
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.800]   and ask yourself,
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:38.800]   if I had to start all over again,
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.800]   what would I start?
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   What would I do?
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   And I've played a lot of these games
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.800]   publicly with things that I've recorded
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:45.800]   for the podcast, etc.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.800]   But to me,
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.800]   it's obvious that most of us,
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:50.800]   if we went back
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.800]   a decade to relive
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:53.800]   the previous decade,
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.800]   we could completely do everything
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:56.800]   totally differently
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.800]   and be back where we are
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.800]   much, much quicker.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.800]   I'm telling you,
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:04.800]   no matter how bad the scenario,
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.800]   you're probably three to five years
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.800]   from a very ordinary looking life.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.800]   Let's go in this direction first.
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:14.800]   We're going to go in terms of
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:15.800]   like physical stuff,
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.800]   but let's go into finances.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:18.800]   If you find yourself
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.800]   in a giant mess,
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.800]   creditors on all sides,
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:23.800]   you borrowed money
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:24.800]   on your credit cards,
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.800]   you maxed out your mortgage,
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.800]   you borrowed money on your credit cards,
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.800]   you invested all that money
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.800]   into risky stocks
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:30.800]   on a margin account,
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.800]   you got margin loans
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:32.800]   and you lost everything.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.800]   All right, let's assume
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:35.800]   that you're in the worst case scenario.
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.800]   You're probably,
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:38.800]   number one,
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.800]   you're some months
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   from resolution
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:41.800]   of the whole situation
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.800]   and you are three to five years
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.800]   from a very normal looking life.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.800]   Let's talk about resolution.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.800]   In the United States,
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   we are very, very fortunate
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.800]   to have a wonderful institution
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:55.800]   called bankruptcy.
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:59.800]   Bankruptcy was invented
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.800]   to help people
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.800]   be willing to take risk
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.800]   and not be saddled
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:06.800]   with that risk
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:07.800]   for the rest of their lives.
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:09.800]   For many years,
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.800]   I myself wrestled
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:12.800]   with the question of bankruptcy.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.800]   Let's talk about it for a moment.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.800]   The reason I wrestled with it
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.800]   is first of all,
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:18.800]   I'm a Christian
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.800]   and in the Bible,
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.800]   people are clearly commanded,
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:22.800]   not just Christians,
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.800]   all people, right?
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.800]   But of course,
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:25.800]   Christians are generally those
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.800]   who say I'm going to take
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   the commands of the Bible
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.800]   very seriously
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.800]   and seek to conform my life to them,
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:32.800]   but commanded to pay your debts.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.800]   Commanded to pay your debts.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.800]   In fact, it says a wicked man
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:37.800]   doesn't pay his debts.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:38.800]   So the Bible is very clear
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.800]   about pay your debts.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.800]   In addition,
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.800]   I myself had a major
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.800]   personal family example
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.800]   of somebody
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.800]   who didn't declare bankruptcy
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:54.800]   because of this sense of honor.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.800]   My grandfather
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.800]   was a farmer.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.800]   He was born and raised as a farmer,
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   but he was also an entrepreneur.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.800]   Many farmers are.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.800]   And there was a time
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:04.800]   in his 30s
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:05.800]   where he got involved,
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.800]   in addition to his farming operations,
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.800]   he got involved
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.800]   in a road construction business.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:11.800]   And he had a business partner
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:12.800]   and he and his business partner
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:14.800]   built their road construction business.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.800]   They had a lot of equipment, etc.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.800]   My grandfather's from Colorado.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:19.800]   They got a contract
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:20.800]   to go to Texas
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:21.800]   and build a road.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.800]   And so they took the contract.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:24.800]   But when they went to Texas,
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.800]   they found something
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.800]   that they had not planned on,
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.800]   which was the Texas soil.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.800]   And long story short,
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:33.800]   as I understand it,
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.800]   the dirt,
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:36.800]   the Texas soil
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:37.800]   that they were building a road in
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.800]   basically destroyed their equipment.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:40.800]   It was so...
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:44.800]   What's the adjective?
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:45.800]   Sandpapery, basically rough.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.800]   It was so abrasive
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.800]   that it destroyed their equipment.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:51.800]   And they wound up
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.800]   struggling massively
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.800]   to even finish it.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:56.800]   And in the middle of the thing,
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:57.800]   they lost all their money.
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:58.800]   They lost all their profit.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.800]   They were in huge amounts of debt.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.800]   And my grandfather's partner
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:04.800]   walked away and said,
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:05.800]   "That's it. I'm out.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:06.800]   I'm done with this.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.800]   Bob, I'd encourage you
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:09.800]   to be done with it too
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.800]   and declare bankruptcy."
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.800]   But my grandfather refused to do it.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.800]   He went deeply into debt.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.800]   He refused to declare bankruptcy.
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:18.800]   And he...
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.800]   And he fought his way out of it.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:22.800]   It took him decades.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.800]   But he finally was able
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.800]   to fight his way out of it,
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:25.800]   finish paying off
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.800]   all of his creditors, etc.
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:29.800]   And he never declared bankruptcy.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:30.800]   And he did that because of honor.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:31.800]   He didn't want to be one
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:34.800]   who declared bankruptcy.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:35.800]   And so having that
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:36.800]   as part of your family heritage
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.800]   was obviously a big thing.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:38.800]   Because I want to be
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.800]   that kind of honorable man.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.800]   But over the years,
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.800]   I've thought a lot about this.
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.800]   And I've come to this conclusion.
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:50.800]   I believe that it is perfectly,
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.800]   morally acceptable
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.800]   for you to declare bankruptcy
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:56.800]   if you can indeed
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.800]   not pay your creditors.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:02.800]   And my reason for that is
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:03.800]   in the modern era,
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.800]   we all go into
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:09.800]   a contract with one another
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.800]   knowing what the law is.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.800]   The way I think about it is this.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.800]   If I went to my brother
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:17.800]   and I said,
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:18.800]   "Hey, brother,
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.800]   lend me $100,000."
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.800]   And he lends me $100,000.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:23.800]   And I go broke.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.800]   That's very different than
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.800]   if I go to a commercial lending company
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.800]   and I say, "Lend me $100,000."
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.800]   And then I go broke.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.800]   Because the commercial lending company
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:38.800]   we have clearly spelled out
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:40.800]   in our contractual agreement
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.800]   what will happen
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:44.800]   in the result of non-performance.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.800]   So if I don't perform on my car loan,
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:48.800]   the car lending company will come
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:49.800]   and collect my car.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.800]   If I don't perform on my mortgage loan,
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:52.800]   the house,
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.800]   the mortgage company will come
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.800]   and they'll repossess my house,
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.800]   foreclose on my house and sell it.
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:59.800]   If I don't perform on my credit cards,
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:01.800]   then the credit card company will come,
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:02.800]   they'll sue me in court,
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.800]   and they'll take my assets
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.800]   if they get their judgment against me.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:09.800]   Bankruptcy laws are created.
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:10.800]   They're public,
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:11.800]   they're clearly understood,
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.800]   and they're a fundamental foundation
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:14.800]   of contract law.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.800]   And declaring bankruptcy thus
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.800]   is not an immoral thing to do.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.800]   It is contractually expected
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.800]   with all of its pros and cons
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:27.800]   and difficulties, etc.
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   It is understood that this is part
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.800]   of the basic agreement of a debt.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.800]   And it's the same with your brother
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:35.800]   or with a company,
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:37.800]   but it has a very different scenario
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.800]   when you're dealing with a commercial lender,
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:43.800]   which is where most of us face our bills.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:47.800]   So if you are in that worst scenario,
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.800]   and I've wrestled with this for years,
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.800]   but at this point I feel confident,
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:55.800]   bankruptcy court is perfectly available to you,
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:58.800]   perfectly reasonable,
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:02.800]   and in many situations is the right solution.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.800]   Don't rush to declare bankruptcy.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.800]   Do not rush to declare bankruptcy.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:07.800]   In many cases,
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:10.800]   you should just simply stop paying your creditors first
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.800]   for a time and then work it out,
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:13.800]   try to set up a workout plan.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.800]   In many cases, bankruptcy doesn't save you anything.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.800]   But you should sit down and do the triage
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:21.800]   and figure out where things are going to be.
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:24.800]   So let's assume that the worst happens, right?
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:25.800]   You're deeply in debt,
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:26.800]   you've borrowed everywhere,
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.800]   put money into your investments,
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.800]   your investments have been struck down to zero,
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.800]   and now you've got debts everywhere,
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.800]   nothing going for you.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.800]   You're going to declare bankruptcy.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.800]   You're going to lose all of your assets,
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:41.800]   except those assets that are exempt
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:44.800]   according to the bankruptcy laws of your estate,
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.800]   and you're going to start over again.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.800]   You'll probably have some debts that come through
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:49.800]   that survived the bankruptcy, right?
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.800]   The debt to your brother or something,
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:54.800]   a debt that you create a workout plan
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.800]   or maybe a mortgage that you cover
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:57.800]   so you can stay in the house.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.800]   But on the other side of bankruptcy court,
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:01.800]   you can start again.
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:04.800]   And most of those debts will be cleared.
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.800]   Bankruptcy is going to stay on your credit.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.800]   You're not going to have any access to that.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:10.800]   It's going to hinder some of your financial opportunities,
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:11.800]   some of your job opportunities,
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.800]   because you're not going to be able to get certain jobs
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.800]   because you've declared bankruptcy in the past.
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:16.800]   But that's okay.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:18.800]   The world is full and available to you.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.800]   And again, you're going to go and you're going to get a job,
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:21.800]   you're going to have income,
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.800]   you're going to start saving money.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:25.800]   Once the whole legal process is settled,
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:27.800]   you'll know what you owe your creditors,
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.800]   how much to whom.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:30.800]   Maybe you'll be working with a bankruptcy trustee
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.800]   to work your way through,
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.800]   depending on what chapter of bankruptcy you file,
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.800]   whether it's a total liquidation or not.
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.800]   You'll be working your way through those debts
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:42.800]   and you'll systematically work your way through the problems.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.800]   It's not the end of the world.
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:50.800]   And based upon your new situation,
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.800]   it'll take you six months to save some thousands of dollars.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.800]   You'll start to establish yourself.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:57.800]   You'll need to rent an apartment.
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.800]   You may have to furnish it.
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:00.800]   You have to get transportation.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.800]   You have to get your children's clothes, etc.
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.800]   But you're three to five years,
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.800]   in the worst case scenario,
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:10.800]   you're three to five years from living a perfectly normal life.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.800]   Five to ten years, probably save enough money,
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.800]   buy another house, etc.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.800]   And what'll happen is you'll do it much smarter
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.800]   and much faster the next time around.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:26.800]   If you combine all of those personal finance moves
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.800]   with what we talk about here on the show,
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.800]   about increasing your income, decreasing your expenses,
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.800]   being thoughtful and strategic,
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.800]   even optimizing your lifestyle, which I'll get to in a moment,
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:41.800]   this transformation, this massive setback,
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.800]   can turn out to be one of the biggest blessings of your life
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.800]   because you have to redesign your life.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:50.800]   It usually doesn't feel like that at the front end,
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.800]   but on the back end of it,
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.800]   you'll often come off the other side
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:01.800]   with recognizing that it turns out to be a blessing.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.800]   Let me give you just two stories.
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.800]   I've not been bankrupt, or at least not yet.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.800]   I hope I don't, but hey, if I do, that's life.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.800]   I've not been bankrupt, but I have been laid off.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.800]   I'll tell you a story in just a moment
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:14.800]   about someone who has been bankrupt.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.800]   I have been laid off.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.800]   I just remember so much how, and most, many of us have, right?
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:20.800]   This is not unique to me,
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:24.800]   but when I got laid off in the first couple days,
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.800]   I was angry about it.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.800]   After a couple, after a year, a couple years,
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.800]   I look back and I was so glad that I had gotten laid off
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.800]   because it gave me a chance to reset,
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.800]   and the decision was made for me.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.800]   It's not a decision I would have chosen,
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.800]   but the decision was made for me.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.800]   In my case, I got laid off in the fall of 2008.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.800]   I had been planning to leave the company I was working for
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.800]   in January 1 of 2009.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.800]   In hindsight, I don't think I would have had the guts to leave
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.800]   because the world was falling apart.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.800]   And so the fact that they laid me off,
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.800]   and sorry, it was the summer of 2008, in July, June or July.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.800]   The fact that they laid me off in the summer of 2008
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.800]   turned out to be a blessing
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:08.800]   because the decision was made and I could go forward,
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.800]   and even though I was facing a bad economy
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.800]   and a recession, et cetera,
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.800]   I was able to go forward because my hand was forced.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:18.800]   You hear this a lot of people when they get divorced.
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.800]   Before the divorce, they say, "Oh, I don't want to."
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.800]   It's this impending thing that's over their head,
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.800]   but finally when the divorce is finalized, they accept it.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:30.800]   You accept, the divorce is done.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.800]   I've got to press forward and I've got to build a new life.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.800]   And in many cases, talk to them a few years later,
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.800]   and while they wouldn't choose that path,
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.800]   they can reflect on the blessings
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.800]   that they've received from that path,
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.800]   and they can say, "Okay, I'm going to press forward
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.800]   and I'm glad for these things."
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:49.800]   The story I was going to tell you
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.800]   was one of my favorites, Dan Sullivan,
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.800]   the great strategic coach founder.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.800]   Dan Sullivan, I think in the '70s, he was a young man.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:04.800]   He got divorced and declared bankruptcy on the same day.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.800]   He'd had a bunch of problems.
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:09.800]   He said that he, let's see, he did divorce in the morning.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.800]   Literally, he went to divorce court in the morning,
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.800]   finalized his divorce, went out, had lunch,
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.800]   went to court in the afternoon, finalized his bankruptcy.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.800]   Divorced and bankrupt on the same day.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.800]   Now, when you hear him talk about it now as an older man
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   and he reflects back on it,
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.800]   he looks back to that as a tremendously difficult thing,
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.800]   but also as one of the great blessings of his life
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.800]   because he was forced by circumstances
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.800]   to recognize that he's screwed everything up
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.800]   and he's going to have to do something differently.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.800]   He made a certain number of life decisions
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:45.800]   that from now on, I'm going to live my life this way.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.800]   Well, fast forward decades later,
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.800]   he's exceedingly wealthy, married, wealthy,
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.800]   huge business, huge prestige and influence
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.800]   all around the world, lives a dream life.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.800]   So bankruptcy is not the end of the world.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.800]   That's, in the Western context,
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.800]   that's the worst that you're facing financially is bankruptcy.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.800]   Now, if you're not bankrupt,
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:12.800]   again, you're probably still three to five years away.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.800]   So, some people faster,
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.800]   but if you're more than five years away
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   with a non-bankruptcy plan,
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.800]   then usually bankruptcy is going to be a better situation.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.800]   But your next time through,
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.800]   even if you've lost everything,
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.800]   your next time through, you're going to do it smarter,
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.800]   do it better.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.800]   You're going to make wiser decisions.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.800]   You're going to be more aggressive.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.800]   You're going to make more money.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.800]   You're going to keep lower expenses.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.800]   You'll quickly rebuild your accounts.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.800]   You'll focus on making wiser investments
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800]   so you don't lose them.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:37.800]   Step by step by step,
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:41.800]   you're in a much better situation.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.800]   10 years from now,
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.800]   you can be financially independent.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.800]   That's what we talk about here at Radical Personal Finance.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.800]   10 years from now,
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:49.800]   you can be financially independent,
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:50.800]   financially free.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.800]   Various paths open to you,
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.800]   but you can do it.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.800]   One of the best things about,
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.800]   let's talk for a moment
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.800]   about a truly dire circumstance.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.800]   I want you to imagine,
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   I mentioned on yesterday's show,
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:10.800]   I want you to imagine you're Alex Jones.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.800]   You've been found by a court.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.800]   Oh, what was it?
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.800]   I mean, they should have just said trillions of dollars,
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.800]   but $1.5 billion,
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:19.800]   something like that,
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:20.800]   final settlement,
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.800]   awarded him another $437 million judgment yesterday.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.800]   So here's what's interesting about this.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.800]   So you're clearly bankrupt.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.800]   The question is what form of bankruptcy you are
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:38.800]   and what the ultimate payout winds up being.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.800]   How do you do it?
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.800]   So I don't know what Jones is going to do.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:46.800]   But the reason I say that is that
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.800]   when you go bankrupt because of a court order,
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.800]   that's very different than some other bankruptcies
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.800]   because there are certain super creditors
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.800]   that can intervene.
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.800]   The IRS is treated differently.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.800]   Tax debt is treated differently in a bankruptcy proceeding
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.800]   than if you just had credit card debt.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.800]   I don't know the intricacies of law that he's facing
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.800]   with regard to a court order.
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:11.800]   But even if you wind up facing a debt
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.800]   that you can never pay,
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.800]   even this is an option for you.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.800]   My favorite story on this regard
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.800]   is the story of Randy Alcorn.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.800]   Back in the 1980s,
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:25.800]   Randy Alcorn was involved in an anti-abortion movement
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.800]   called Operation Rescue.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.800]   Randy Alcorn is a Christian preacher.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:33.800]   Planned Parenthood and various pro-abortion advocates
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.800]   were very successful at that time
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.800]   in passing a wave of new laws
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.800]   about special protections for abortion mills.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.800]   Alcorn was arrested for protesting
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.800]   in front of these abortion mills
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.800]   and he wound up losing his case.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.800]   So in the court case,
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:57.800]   he was forced by the judge and the judgment
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.800]   to make a huge payout to Planned Parenthood,
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:01.800]   millions of dollars.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.800]   And Alcorn, due to his conscience,
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:07.800]   said, "I will never pay Planned Parenthood a cent.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.800]   "I'm never going to do it.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:10.800]   "I'm not going to pay them anything."
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.800]   If you go back and you read his books,
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.800]   he's written a number of excellent books on money,
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.800]   it's quite interesting because that moment to him
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.800]   was such a freeing moment
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:21.800]   where in order for him to never pay that judgment
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:22.800]   to Planned Parenthood,
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.800]   it meant that he could not have any money.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.800]   Because if he had any money,
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.800]   Planned Parenthood had a judgment against him
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.800]   that they were going to be able to come and collect from it.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.800]   And so for decades,
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.800]   until the judgment expired,
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:37.800]   for decades,
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:41.800]   he could never earn more than minimum wage
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.800]   because he had a minimum wage
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.800]   that was protected by the laws of his state
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:50.800]   that the predator could not garnish.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.800]   And so he was protected.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:53.800]   But that freeing,
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:57.800]   he found it an incredibly freeing feeling to say,
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.800]   "I can't accumulate any money.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.800]   "I cannot accumulate money
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.800]   "because otherwise Planned Parenthood will come and take it
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:06.800]   "and I will not contribute to their evil."
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:11.800]   And so he was guaranteed to be poor.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.800]   But it was an incredibly freeing thing for him.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.800]   And I myself actually use this
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:21.800]   as a standard coaching question when I coach people.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.800]   One of my favorite ways that I phrase the question is this.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.800]   I say to people,
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:28.800]   usually we'll talk about,
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.800]   "Hey, if you were wealthy, what would you do?" etc.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.800]   But the way that I phrase it now is this.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.800]   I say, "Let's play a game.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:42.800]   "I want you to assume that I'm your accountant.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:47.800]   "And I call you up and I say, 'Listen, Joe,
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.800]   "'I got bad news for you.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.800]   "'Bad news is this.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.800]   "'I know you thought I was doing a good job
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.800]   "'in preparing your tax returns properly for you,
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.800]   "'but in reality, what I've actually been doing
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.800]   "'is I've been filing false tax returns with the IRS
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.800]   "'and I've been embezzling and swindling the money
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.800]   "'that I've been getting from them.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.800]   "'And so you, unfortunately, Joe,
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.800]   "'are now in the situation
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:14.800]   "'where you owe the IRS $58 bajillion.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.800]   "'And I'm sorry, but this means that
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.800]   "'for the rest of your life,
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.800]   "'you're going to have to pay this debt.'"
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.800]   And, "Yeah, I know, but they caught me.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.800]   "I'm going to go to prison, but I promise you, Joe,
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.800]   "there's no way to get out of it."
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:28.800]   "You owe the IRS $58 bajillion."
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:29.800]   So what that means, Joe,
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:32.800]   is you're never going to be able to own anything
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.800]   for the rest of your life.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:35.800]   Because if you own it,
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:38.800]   then the IRS is going to come and they're going to seize it.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.800]   You're never going to be able to accumulate any money.
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.800]   Because if you have any money left in your bank account
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:44.800]   at the end of the month,
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.800]   then the IRS is going to swoop in
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.800]   and they're going to take it.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.800]   So my question, Joe, is if that happened,
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.800]   what would you do?
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.800]   What would you do if you knew you could never retire?
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.800]   What would you do if you knew
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.800]   you could never accumulate any money?
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.800]   What would you do?
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.800]   How would you live?
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:09.800]   If you find yourself at the moment destitute financially
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:13.800]   because of a business loss or an FTX implosion or whatever,
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.800]   I urge you to think about that.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.800]   What would you do?
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:22.800]   I could tell you exactly what I would do myself.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.800]   First thing I would focus on is,
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.800]   where do I want to live?
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.800]   And I would choose to live in a place that I loved.
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.800]   I said I would live in a place that I loved.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.800]   I would choose to live in a place that I loved.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.800]   Myself, I'd probably choose a mountain town somewhere,
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.800]   Utah, Colorado, something like that.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.800]   Kind of a ski town type of thing.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.800]   Montana.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:49.800]   I'd live in the United States in that scenario.
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.800]   As long-time listeners know,
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:52.800]   although I think there are many places in the world
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:53.800]   that have a lot to offer,
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.800]   I think the United States has a lot to offer.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.800]   That would be the first thing,
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.800]   is I'd choose carefully a place to live that I loved
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.800]   and offered me a really cool lifestyle.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.800]   Second thing that I would focus on is
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.800]   making sure that I'm around people that I like.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:11.800]   I want to love my neighbors.
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.800]   I want to be with the family members, etc. that I like.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.800]   And the third thing I'd focus on is
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.800]   I'd focus on getting a job that was well-suited to me.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.800]   I myself, I'd probably go and be a teacher.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:23.800]   If I couldn't be a college professor, that would be ideal.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.800]   I don't have a PhD myself,
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.800]   so I don't think I have the credentials necessary
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:28.800]   to be a college professor.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:29.800]   I'm not sure actually what I'm interested in teaching
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:30.800]   at the college level,
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:34.800]   but I would love to go and be a high school teacher.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.800]   I would teach something like economics, history,
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.800]   politics, government, civics, personal finance,
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:43.800]   something like that.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.800]   I'd go be a high school teacher.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.800]   I wouldn't make a ton of money,
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.800]   but I would make enough money to live comfortably on.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.800]   And by being thoughtful and strategic
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.800]   and surrounding myself with work that I'm passionate about,
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:00.800]   meaning to be able to impact people with ideas,
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.800]   to be able to inspire, to be able to teach, etc,
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.800]   I would enjoy going to work every day.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.800]   And by choosing a job that has a comfortable work-life balance,
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.800]   go to work at 7, get out at 3,
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:15.800]   do that 180 days a year,
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:18.800]   the other 180 days of the year I'm off,
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.800]   life is good.
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:21.800]   This is a much lower workload
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:25.800]   than virtually anyone has had throughout history.
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.800]   On my grandfather's day, the standard work week
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:31.800]   was 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:34.800]   That would give me plenty of time for other things.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.800]   If I couldn't earn money,
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.800]   I would take the balance of my time,
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.800]   I would pick a problem in the world
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.800]   that I'm passionate about
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:47.800]   and focus my efforts on seeking to solve that.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:52.800]   Could be something local, my neighborhood.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.800]   Could be something in my state.
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.800]   Could be something online, kind of a macro problem.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.800]   Various ways of solving it.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:03.800]   And then I would focus on enjoying being in my local community.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:09.800]   I'd join a local church, build strong friendships,
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.800]   relationships, etc.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.800]   Now, none of that requires you to accumulate money.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.800]   None of that requires you to be wealthy.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.800]   It just so happens that there are some nice things, right?
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.800]   If I went and got a job at a government school being a teacher,
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.800]   I'd probably have a government pension of some kind.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.800]   That's nice.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.800]   But I'd try to choose a career
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:28.800]   that I could continue for a long time.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.800]   My goal with teaching would be to be able to teach
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:33.800]   until I was 85, 90 years old.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.800]   My grandfather taught until he was in his early 80s.
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.800]   So, that's doable.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:43.800]   You think about it, but the point is that money is not necessary,
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:48.800]   being wealthy is not necessary for you to live a great life.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.800]   So play that game out.
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.800]   You're sitting in your room thinking your life is over
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:56.800]   because you lost all your money.
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.800]   My friend, it's not.
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:02.800]   You don't owe the IRS $58 bajillion
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.800]   such that you'll never be able to save money.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.800]   You're 3 to 5 years away from a radically different life.
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:12.800]   Everything is available to you.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:15.800]   It's not the end of the world.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.800]   Let's go on and talk about some disciplines.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:22.800]   I mentioned yesterday on the show things like exercise, sun, etc.
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:26.800]   What I've tried so far in this show to emphasize
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:33.800]   is that the war is in your own head with your own thoughts,
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.800]   not external.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.800]   I can solve all your financial problems,
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.800]   coach you through all the right financial decisions.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.800]   Anyone else can too.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.800]   It's not me.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.800]   Get the money stuff on paper where you can look at it,
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.800]   sit down with an informed person.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.800]   If you're broke, bankrupt right now,
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.800]   I encourage you to write out all the numbers.
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.800]   Create a balance sheet, cash flow statement, etc.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:02.800]   Find somebody that is around the money business.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:06.800]   Local accountant, buddy of yours who's a businessman,
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.800]   attorney, financial advisor, insurance agent,
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.800]   somebody who's around the business.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.800]   Sit down and say, "I need to talk to somebody.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:14.800]   I need some help.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:15.800]   I've screwed up.
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:16.800]   I lost a bunch of money.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:17.800]   My business went broke.
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:18.800]   What do I do?
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.800]   What would you do in these numbers?"
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.800]   Start getting counsel on that.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:24.800]   The point is that the number stuff is easy.
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.800]   What's not easy is winning the war in your head.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.800]   In order to win the war in your head,
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.800]   you need a variety of tactics.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.800]   Positive thinking isn't enough.
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.800]   It's a good start.
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:38.800]   Failure is an event.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.800]   It's not a person.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:41.800]   It's a good start, but you can say that to yourself
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.800]   and still be in a pretty bad spot.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.800]   Let's talk about at least what I focus on.
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:47.800]   I'm no psychologist, psychiatrist.
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.800]   They probably have more things that can help you,
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:55.800]   but here's what I focus on.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:00.800]   Number one, you need to be honest,
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.800]   and you need to be free, mentally free,
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.800]   spiritually free.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.800]   Honest with yourself.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.800]   That's what the process is, but honest with others.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.800]   If you lost a million dollars,
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.800]   and that was the family's life savings,
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.800]   you can't keep that to yourself.
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:19.800]   You got to go to your wife.
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:20.800]   You got to go to your husband.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.800]   You got to go to whomever and acknowledge it.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.800]   If other people were involved, you got to say,
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:26.800]   "Here's what happened.
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:27.800]   I screwed up."
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:30.800]   You got to clear it out and be honest.
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:42.800]   The very first element of forgiveness is confession.
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:46.800]   You must always confess your sins,
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:51.800]   confess your mistakes, confess those things.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:55.800]   You need to focus on identifying and admitting
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:59.800]   where you were wrong, what you did wrong.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.800]   If you made a mistake, try to identify
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:04.800]   why did you make the mistake?
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.800]   What did you do wrong?
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.800]   This honesty is important for yourself
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.800]   so that you can learn from the lesson.
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.800]   The only thing that makes a horrible mistake worse
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.800]   is not learning anything from it
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.800]   and going through it again.
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.800]   So when you make a mistake, when you screw up,
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:25.800]   learn from it.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:29.800]   At least that way, you got some benefit from it.
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.800]   And so identify what it is.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:35.800]   If you defrauded somebody,
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:36.800]   you need to go and acknowledge,
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:38.800]   "I defrauded you.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.800]   I swindled you."
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.800]   If you've just simply made a mistake,
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:44.800]   you may acknowledge it.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:46.800]   Acknowledge where you are
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.800]   so that you can build for the future.
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:52.800]   By acknowledging it out loud, verbally,
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:54.800]   confessing it if you're single,
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.800]   find a friend that you trust
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:57.800]   and acknowledge what's going on.
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:02.800]   Don't try to maintain a facade of who you are.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.800]   Be honest.
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:10.800]   Almost all things can be forgiven.
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:15.800]   First of all, certainly all things can be forgiven by God.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:16.800]   And if you have God's forgiveness,
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.800]   what else matters?
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:19.800]   But even by other people,
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.800]   when you are honest
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.800]   and you honestly acknowledge what you've done wrong,
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.800]   again, if it's on the level of a moral level,
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.800]   such as fraud or something like that,
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:30.800]   acknowledge it.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.800]   If it's just on the level of mistake,
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.800]   acknowledge, "Here's the mistake I made.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.800]   I trusted FTX.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:37.800]   It seemed smart, right?
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.800]   Tom Brady said I should."
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.800]   Well, now we've learned a hard lesson.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:43.800]   This sucks.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:44.800]   It really sucks.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.800]   But this is--
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:47.800]   Now we learn, I shouldn't have trusted.
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.800]   But acknowledge the mistakes and confess them.
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:52.800]   Get them out there clearly.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.800]   Learn the lessons from them.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:56.800]   And by acknowledging them,
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.800]   you can bring yourself to a place of peace.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.800]   It's not to say the road ahead is going to be easy,
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.800]   but the worst thing is to still have that stuff in your head
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.800]   or be harboring secrets
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.800]   or trying to maintain an image or a facade
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.800]   of the way that you want people to see you
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.800]   instead of acknowledging it.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:12.800]   When you do that,
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:13.800]   it may feel like it,
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.800]   but it's pride.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.800]   It's stupid pride.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.800]   And what it does is it keeps anybody
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.800]   from stepping in and helping you.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.800]   So the first step is acknowledging it.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.800]   Think of how effective this is in the AA
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:27.800]   and various anonymous groups.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:28.800]   You step in and you say,
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.800]   "This is who I am and this is what I've done."
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:31.800]   And everyone else says,
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:32.800]   "Yeah, we know.
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:33.800]   We've been there too."
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:34.800]   So acknowledge it.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.800]   Acknowledge the problem.
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.800]   I'm not necessarily saying to broadcast it.
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:41.800]   You should acknowledge it to people
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:44.800]   who love you and can help you.
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.800]   But in terms of acknowledging it,
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:52.800]   you want to be focused on actually acknowledging it.
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:57.800]   By verbally, openly acknowledging where you are,
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:01.800]   you can achieve peace with the situation
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.800]   and start to rebuild.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.800]   You can eliminate the mental torture.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:11.800]   You can face the facts honestly and forthrightly.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:15.800]   No matter how ugly those facts are,
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:19.800]   at least if you can face them directly,
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.800]   you can achieve that mental freedom
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.800]   to know what to do next.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.800]   But if it's all wrapped up in your head,
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:29.800]   then it ain't going to work.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:31.800]   Next is get counsel.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.800]   We've talked about that extensively,
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.800]   but the point is don't try to fight it alone.
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.800]   So get advice, get counsel.
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:38.800]   That advice and that counsel
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:41.800]   could be specific to the situation.
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:42.800]   You may need financial advice.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.800]   You may need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.800]   You may need to talk to a friend in business,
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.800]   kind of determine how and best to fight through.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:50.800]   You may need to talk to an accountant.
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:51.800]   You may need to talk to your landlord,
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.800]   explain that you're not going to be able to pay your rent.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.800]   Get advice and counsel.
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.800]   But also in terms of your brain,
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.800]   get advice and counsel.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.800]   Speak to a friend.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.800]   Explain to your friend what you're going through
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:05.800]   and how the world is black.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.800]   Talk to your pastor.
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:08.800]   Talk to a psychiatrist.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:11.800]   Talk to a counselor, a therapist.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.800]   Seek out counsel that is appropriate
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.800]   so that you can verbalize the problems
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:19.800]   and not try to solve them all in your head.
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.800]   Next, I fundamentally believe that exercise
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.800]   is one of the most important habits to build in.
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:30.800]   I have failed at this again and again and again in my life.
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.800]   When I succeed,
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.800]   as thankfully I'm succeeding myself at the moment,
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.800]   I see the positive impact.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.800]   But as a human being,
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:43.800]   you need to set up a system of exercise for yourself.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:46.800]   That should probably be just simply going out and walking.
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.800]   Leave your phone behind.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.800]   Find a nice place to walk,
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.800]   a nice park or wherever you have appropriate
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:56.800]   and go out and walk 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.800]   Get your brain right.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.800]   And moving will affect your brain.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:03.800]   Tony Robbins' thing for years,
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:06.800]   that your mental state can be produced--
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:09.800]   your mental state can change your physical state,
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.800]   but it goes the other way as well.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:13.800]   So you can change your mental state to affect--
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:16.800]   excuse me, change your physical state to change your mental state.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:17.800]   You can do his exercises.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:20.800]   You can do other people's great exercises if you're hardcore.
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:24.800]   But just focus on physical exercise.
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:27.800]   A man who has physical daily activity,
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:30.800]   a hard walk, hiking the hills,
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:31.800]   a hard session with the weights,
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:34.800]   going to the boxing gym, etc.,
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.800]   is going to be better in all of these situations
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.800]   than the man who sits around and mopes in his own misery.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.800]   Inactivity and sedentary lifestyle
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:45.800]   will make everything you're facing worse.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.800]   And so find something that's available to you.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:53.800]   I think it's ideal if it fits for you to do something that is social.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.800]   So joining a local boxing gym
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.800]   or being at a gym where there's people,
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:00.800]   especially if there's friends or there's a class or something like that,
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:04.800]   can again help to activate that social connection
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.800]   to where you're not alone all the time.
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.800]   Don't be alone all the time
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.800]   because everything is worse when you're alone.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.800]   Next, sunshine.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:15.800]   Make it a specific habit
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:18.800]   to make sure that you're getting abundant sunshine.
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:22.800]   Your brain and your body need sunshine to feel good.
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:28.800]   And so figure out how to regularly get consistent sunshine.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:33.800]   And there's more that could be said,
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.800]   but I've covered it and I'll be repeating myself.
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:38.800]   Social connection, go to church,
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.800]   go to be with people,
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:43.800]   have an anchoring point and don't try to fight it alone.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:45.800]   As human beings, we're not meant to be alone,
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:49.800]   and you can work your way through it.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:53.800]   I believe that concludes everything that I want to say.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.800]   I didn't have a tight outline for this show,
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:03.800]   so I hope that my comments were sufficiently coherent to help you.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:10.800]   I just want to remind you and inspire you
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:12.800]   that this is all doable.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:19.800]   And let me talk for just a moment about the black path.
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.800]   Do not kill yourself.
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:27.800]   I've tried to discuss
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.800]   and I've tried to put this into proper perspective
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:30.800]   by saying it's only money.
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:34.800]   That's been my focus.
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:37.800]   Many times people with money kill themselves,
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.800]   and people kill themselves for other reasons too.
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.800]   What's remarkable about our brains
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:46.800]   is how even when things are going well,
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.800]   we wind up doing stupid stuff.
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:54.800]   And I don't even pretend to understand
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.800]   what people who are suicidal go through.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:02.800]   There's clearly a wide variety.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:05.800]   But I guess what I want to say is
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.800]   what always stands out to me is
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:11.800]   you can be one of the most successful guys in the world
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:14.800]   and still put the gun in your mouth.
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:17.800]   So it's just astonishing.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.800]   Probably the biggest one for me,
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:20.800]   because I always loved him so much,
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.800]   was Anthony Bourdain.
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:25.800]   Here's a guy who has the dream life
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:28.800]   and yet still winds up...
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.800]   It's sad.
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.800]   So just recognize that
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:37.800]   ending the pain the way that you're thinking of doing it,
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:38.800]   if that's your situation,
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.800]   it's not going to end anything.
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:42.800]   It's just going to make more pain.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:45.800]   First of all, recognize very clearly
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.800]   if you commit suicide,
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.800]   you are murdering someone,
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.800]   which is a grave sin.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.800]   You must never murder someone,
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:57.800]   especially yourself.
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.800]   Don't do it.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.800]   Acknowledge also that
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:03.800]   it's going to make everything worse
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:06.800]   for everyone around you.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:11.800]   One of the most selfish things you could possibly do.
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.800]   And the only reason...
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.800]   If you're suicidal for some other reason,
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.800]   again, I don't understand it.
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.800]   I've been in pretty black places,
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.800]   never contemplated suicide,
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.800]   so I acknowledge that.
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.800]   But if you're there because of money,
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:29.800]   if you're thinking that,
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:32.800]   "Oh, financially this is going to fix everything,
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:35.800]   because I got a life insurance policy or whatever,"
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:36.800]   it's not.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.800]   It's going to be far worse.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:42.800]   And what pisses me off so much
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.800]   is when people don't just open their mouth
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:45.800]   and talk about it,
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:46.800]   because we can fix it.
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.800]   I'm hoping to convey to you
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:49.800]   the confidence that I have
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:52.800]   that you can fix the finances.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.800]   There's no financial problem that you can bring me
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:55.800]   that I can't fix.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.800]   I can't guarantee you're going to be a billionaire, obviously.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:01.800]   What I mean is you can live a really great life
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:05.800]   no matter how deep your hole is right now.
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:06.800]   So this is all a mirage,
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:07.800]   all this mental game of,
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:08.800]   "Oh, I lost all my money,
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.800]   so I'm just going to kill myself because it's over."
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.800]   You idiot, it's not over.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:13.800]   Don't be stupid.
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:14.800]   Don't be a coward.
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.800]   Step up and fix it
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.800]   and make yourself someone to be proud of
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.800]   by facing your problems
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:24.800]   and tackling them and fixing them.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.800]   Don't be stupid and a coward
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:28.800]   and think, "Oh, I lost all my money,
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:32.800]   so there I'm going to go and kill myself."
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:38.800]   That would be the stupidest possible thing you could do.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:40.800]   As a human being,
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.800]   a creature made in the image of God,
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.800]   put here on this earth
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:49.800]   to rule and to reign here and now,
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.800]   you owe it to yourself
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.800]   to use your setback and transform yourself.
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:57.800]   And you owe it to your fellow travelers
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.800]   who are also facing tragedy,
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:01.800]   in many cases vastly worse
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:03.800]   than the tragedy that you're facing.
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:06.800]   You owe it to them to be an inspirational example
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.800]   of somebody who presses forward
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.800]   and solves his problems
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:11.800]   rather than sitting back
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:18.800]   and taking the coward's way out.
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.800]   Just think for a moment,
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:23.800]   how many men,
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.800]   a guy like Dan Sullivan,
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.800]   has inspired over the years
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:31.800]   with his story of divorce and bankruptcy
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:35.800]   on the same day.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:42.800]   Think of how big his impact has been.
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:46.800]   The premier entrepreneur's coach in the world
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:51.800]   coached thousands and thousands of high performers.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.800]   The hardship, the tragedy,
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:58.800]   is the tool that can be used to better the world.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.800]   Think of the story I told you about my grandfather.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.800]   Just imagine my grandfather,
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:05.800]   failed in business, bankrupt, etc.,
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:08.800]   puts a gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:11.800]   What does that do to your family legacy?
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:14.800]   Versus here's a man who spent decades,
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.800]   I think something like 30 years,
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:18.800]   the next 30 years,
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:21.800]   paying off these debts systematically.
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:23.800]   And think of the legacy.
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:27.800]   So I have no idea what I'm supposed to say
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:28.800]   to people who are suicidal.
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.800]   I don't know how to do it.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:31.800]   I don't know what to say
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:32.800]   other than just to be honest
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.800]   and to say you are stupid
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:37.800]   if you think that killing yourself
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:41.800]   because of a financial loss
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.800]   is a smart thing to do.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.800]   You're behaving stupidly.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:50.800]   And you ought to be ashamed of yourself and stop it.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.800]   We can fix all your problems.
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:56.800]   The next week, I don't know,
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:58.800]   I guess probably I should say
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.800]   I'm opening up consultations here.
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:02.800]   If you're suicidal
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:05.800]   and you're thinking that killing yourself is the solution,
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:06.800]   book a consultation with me.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:07.800]   I won't charge you a dime.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.800]   I'll yell at you for being stupid for thinking about it
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:10.800]   and I won't charge you a dime.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:12.800]   And then I'll fix your problems for you.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:13.800]   I'll tell you how you can do it.
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.800]   Again, I can't do it for you,
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.800]   but I'll tell you the path.
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:18.800]   So book a consultation with me.
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:23.800]   Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult.
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:25.800]   So I'm activating that again for a limited time
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:27.800]   here in the next few days.
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:29.800]   So the point is don't be stupid.
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:30.800]   It's just money.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:33.800]   It's only money.
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:35.800]   It's only money.
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:37.800]   It's all fake.
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:39.800]   Easy come, easy go.
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:41.800]   It went.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:42.800]   All right, sucks.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:45.800]   Would have been smarter to sell out, learn the lessons.
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:46.800]   But you can get it all back
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:48.800]   and times a bazillion times
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:50.800]   because it's only money.
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:55.800]   It's the most unlimited resource in the history of the world.
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:58.800]   Get out of your head, however you do it.
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:30:59.800]   Again, I'm not a psychiatrist.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:00.800]   I don't know what I'm supposed to say
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.800]   to people who are suicidal.
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.800]   So go talk to someone who knows.
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:08.800]   But that's what I tell you is it's only money.
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.800]   We can fix it.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:16.800]   And this trial, this catastrophe that you're facing,
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:19.800]   if you will allow it,
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:24.800]   can be the seed of a transformed life
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:27.800]   and everything can be better.
[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:29.800]   Guarantee you it'll be hard to work your way out.
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:30.800]   But you know what?
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:35.800]   Hard is actually rewarding.
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:40.800]   Some of the most rewarding work that we do is the hard work.
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:45.800]   Think of how you feel after a long, hard day of physical labor.
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.800]   Come in at the end of the day,
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:49.800]   been out mowing the grass, trimming your trees,
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:50.800]   digging a ditch, working.
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:51.800]   Your body aches.
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:56.800]   You sit down in a chair and you feel satisfied with hard work.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.800]   My favorite quote on success is, or happiness,
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:01.800]   I think it was W. Clement Stone who said,
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:07.800]   "Happiness is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal."
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:12.800]   "Happiness is the successive or progressive realization of a worthy ideal."
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:17.800]   The journey is the point, not the destination.
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:19.800]   Anybody who's achieved any goal in life knows
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:21.800]   that the destination is never the point.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:22.800]   You've graduated high school.
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:23.800]   You thought, "Oh, I graduated high school.
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:25.800]   It's going to be great.
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:26.800]   It was great for two days."
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.800]   And then you felt lost.
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:32.800]   The journey is the point.
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:33.800]   It's not the destination.
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:34.800]   It's not the goal.
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:36.800]   It's the struggle.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:39.800]   That's the entire goal.
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:41.800]   That's the point.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:45.800]   And so if you struggle to dig your way out of this hole that you're in,
[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:46.800]   embrace it.
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.800]   You're going to rebuild it.
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.800]   Just remember that no matter how rich or how poor you are,
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:54.800]   at the end of your life, it's all gone anyway.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.800]   You don't take it with you.
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:01.800]   If I could snap my fingers, right, poor Sam, what's his name?
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:02.800]   Poor Sam.
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:06.800]   I mean, obviously, he deserves a huge amount of criticism, but even he.
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:09.800]   Here's a guy who overnight becomes a multibillionaire,
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:13.800]   and then overnight he's not a multibillionaire anymore.
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:14.800]   But guess what?
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:21.800]   Even if he remained a multibillionaire, the end of his life, it's all gone.
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:24.800]   30 years later, who knows, right?
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.800]   It's money.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.800]   It's not that big a deal.
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:32.800]   What matters is what you learn in the process
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:35.800]   and how that affects other people.
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:36.800]   The money is not the point.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:37.800]   It's the path.
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:38.800]   It's the journey.
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:39.800]   It's the work.
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:40.800]   It's the labor.
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:41.800]   It's the toil.
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:42.800]   That's the point.
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:46.800]   This is why some of the best, happiest people, those are getting out of debt,
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:48.800]   even if they haven't faced catastrophe.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:51.800]   They're just focused on getting out of debt.
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:55.800]   The journey is its own reward.
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:57.800]   I don't have anything more useful to say.
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:59.800]   I just want to say that my heart's with you.
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.800]   If I were with you, I'd cry with you.
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:02.800]   It sucks.
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:03.800]   Have a good cry.
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:05.800]   Get it out of your system.
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:06.800]   Build a plan.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:07.800]   Look at the numbers.
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:14.800]   I promise you it's not the end, and you will look back on this.
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:17.800]   Three years from now, five years from now, ten years from now,
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:23.800]   you will look back on this as an exceedingly valuable part of your life.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:25.800]   I promise you.
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:27.800]   I love you.
