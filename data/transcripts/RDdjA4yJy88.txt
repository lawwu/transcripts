[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   Captain Calacanis is here reporting for duty.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.000]   Where's that Spirit Airlines cap?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   Absolutely.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.800]   Spirit Airlines.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.000]   I just want to say all in podcast now sponsored by Moncler
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.100]   and Spirit Airlines or now sponsored by the village people.
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.500]   YMCA.
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.600]   Are you a pilot or a flight attendant?
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.000]   Jk.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   He's a flight attendant.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.200]   I don't think it's thin enough to be a flight attendant.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.900]   Are you fat shaming me?
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.600]   Are you body?
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.800]   Can't do that nowadays.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.800]   I'll get you canceled.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.700]   Get exact canceled at this point.
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.800]   Like fat shaming would be number 72 on the list.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.700]   He can't get canceled because all the libs have left Twitter.
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.200]   There's nobody to there's no home monitors left.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.000]   They all pretend.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   No, they quit every week.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.700]   It's like all the libs.
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.400]   You said they moved to Canada when Trump got elected.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.200]   Yeah, Canada immigration.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.800]   Go ahead.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:01:09.900]   A hacker figured out a way to take all this data and track,
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.600]   you know, people's yachts, people's planes.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.100]   Obviously, one of those people was Elon.
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.200]   Elon had a security issue.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.000]   This is all public information.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   So the larger issue at stake here is.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.100]   The fact that the law allows for people to do this persistent
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.400]   tracking of planes, which then becomes persistent tracking of
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.000]   a person and what really is at stake here is how we define the
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.100]   term doxing for people who don't know the term doxing.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.500]   It means giving a person's location that could be your home.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.900]   That could also be your at a location for some period of time.
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.100]   You're you're at a hotel, you know for a basketball game and
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.000]   it's pretty clear.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.100]   You can take a picture of a celebrity say there's a celebrity
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.400]   here.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.800]   Oh Lady Gaga's at the farmers market.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.000]   What I object to here.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.600]   We all understand doxing is dangerous and it in fact is against
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.200]   the law to just give people's addresses and stuff like that.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.300]   The issue here is a new type of doxing which I'll call, you know,
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.200]   persistent coordinated doxing where dozens of times a month,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.300]   you're giving a person's location.
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.500]   It may not be against the first amendment sacks.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.700]   I think you would agree but we have to ask ourselves do we want
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.000]   to live in a world where whether a person's on an electric bicycle
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.200]   or an airplane or any device in between somebody should be
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.300]   releasing dozens of times a month a specific dedicated feet of
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.000]   their location.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.100]   It is terrorizing as a parent when this happens.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.500]   I've had doxing people on the call here.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.900]   I've had various security concerns.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.700]   We don't want to live in a world with de facto doxing.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.200]   What these sites were doing was de facto doxing.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.000]   I think it was a bad decision and I think that it represented
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.500]   you on the least generous statement would be that it represents
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.600]   deep hypocrisy in that not just a few weeks ago.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.400]   Did he say he would never delete that account?
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   But he also said he was buying Twitter to enable freedom of speech
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.700]   and freedom of expression and that he wouldn't come in and do the
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.700]   same sort of content moderation that was done by the old regime.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.400]   And then he came in and did exactly what the old regime did, which
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.000]   is that he took the rules and he took the quote moderation policies
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.800]   and he found a way to use them to make some editorialized decisions
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.900]   that he thought was appropriate.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.500]   Now, the more generous thing is what you guys are saying, which I
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.000]   don't think is necessarily wrong, which is that he's trying to
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.900]   protect people where there's some loophole or some law that doesn't
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.100]   seem right morally, but it is the law and it is what it is.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.300]   In those cases, I think you run into the exact same issue that the
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.900]   old guard at Twitter had that the moderators and the executives at
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.600]   YouTube have dealt with and that the executives at Google have dealt
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   with and that we sit here and we criticize until you're on that
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.500]   side of the table and you're forced to make these moderation
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.000]   decisions.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.300]   You're forced to make these policy decisions and you're forced to
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.400]   implement these policy decisions because of some moral framework
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.000]   that you now think is appropriate.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.700]   And guess what?
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.300]   Some people will say that's not freedom of expression.
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.900]   That's not freedom of speech.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.300]   You're taking that away from some people.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.300]   You're taking this particular case away from a 15 or 16 year old
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.000]   kid who's built a Twitter feed.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.100]   And so I think what it shows is just how hard it is to moderate
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.600]   these sites, these platforms, and that there is no simple, easy,
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.500]   idealistic ideologue of, hey, all these things are open.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.200]   All these things can be used by anyone all the time, because as
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.000]   soon as one of these edge cases start to happen, you want to come
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.900]   in and do something about it.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.600]   Shemoth, what do you think?
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.700]   What should happen going forward?
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.400]   So I have had these issues happen to me multiple times.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.700]   I'm not nearly as important as Elon is, but it feels the same
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.800]   when you're in the middle of it.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.700]   It feels pretty terrorizing.
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.400]   That being said, I think the real decision for somebody like me
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.200]   is that if it's too much is frankly just to get rid of it and
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.800]   you know to find a different mode of transportation that's a
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.800]   little bit more anonymous.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.500]   And you're pragmatic about it.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.400]   And the reason I say that is that I just think that you would
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.000]   have to go and get the government to basically change the law
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.100]   which they're not going to do.
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.800]   And so then as a result, your reaction will seem somewhat
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.900]   contrived and deeply personal.
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.800]   And in that I think you lose credibility.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.400]   Let me just summarize this and be the first one to just state
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.500]   this. I think that if there's any person in the world that can
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.400]   figure out Twitter, it's probably Elon.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.400]   But man, has he taken on just a gargantuan battle and increasingly
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.200]   I am not a fan of this battle and I'll tell you why this is a
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.500]   man who is essentially proven that he can bend the laws of
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.300]   physics on behalf of humanity.
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.900]   He's done it twice once in electric cars and once in rocketry.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.400]   The problem is that the realm of decision-making at Twitter
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.000]   has nothing to do with the laws of physics and is governed by
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.400]   emotions and psychology in which there is no canonically
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.100]   right answer.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.800]   And so he's quickly finding out that half the population will
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.900]   always find fault with him no matter what he does.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.100]   And now the implication of that becomes very important.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.800]   We saw yesterday that he had to sell another 3.8 billion dollars
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.700]   of Tesla stock.
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.300]   Why is that?
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.800]   It's because this transaction which was, you know, very tight
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   to get done probably required lots of margin, you know, there
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   are I look I have a margin loan at Credit Suisse.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   So I know how these things work and you can very quickly get
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.600]   margin called.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.400]   You have to sell down things that you own in order to maintain
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.700]   your collateral limits.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.000]   We've talked about this before.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   He's had to do this twice now in the last few weeks and that's
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.600]   because again not because of the demand at Tesla as far as
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.100]   we can tell but because people believe he's distracted and
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.300]   so people are anticipating weakness at Tesla.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.000]   People are now shorting the stock.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.400]   Anyways, it's causing this downward spiral.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.000]   And can he fix it?
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.100]   I think so.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.300]   Can he pull it all out?
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.900]   Sure.
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.100]   Is it just putting himself under an enormous amount of pressure
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.100]   that he could have avoided somewhat?
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.500]   Yes, and I think that this is sort of where we're at six weeks
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.900]   in my God.
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.700]   I mean, I was saying this guy learned in six weeks what it
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.800]   took YouTube seven years to learn how hard it is to moderate
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.600]   content and you know, I think this is where I disagree is
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.500]   you're you're attributing so much good faith to these content
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.900]   moderators at YouTube and Twitter when the Twitter files
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.100]   reveal that they made no effort to suppress their bias.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:43.500]   In fact, they were like pretty much dancing in the streets
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.700]   every time they booted off someone they didn't like.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.100]   Fair enough.
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.200]   Before you react to what Freeberg just said at the end that
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.000]   coda, can you respond to what I just said?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.600]   Isn't it true?
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.300]   Like it's like well look, I mean if you define what Elon
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.200]   is, you know doing there as you know, acting as a judge
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.700]   arbitrating on every little content moderation decision.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.400]   Is that a great use of his time relative to what he could be
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.500]   building at Tesla and SpaceX and doing on behalf of humanity
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.900]   then? No, clearly not.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.700]   But if you define what he's doing in the larger sense as
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.800]   restoring free speech to the most important Town Square
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.700]   social network, hopefully thereby inspiring other tech
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.900]   companies to move in the direction of opening things up.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.000]   Then I actually think it's a pretty good use of his time.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.500]   So look, I think we can quibble about this or that decision
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.100]   that he makes or this or that tweet, but I think the overall
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.100]   thrust of what he's doing is very important for the country
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.400]   and for humanity.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.100]   So I get where you're coming from.
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.900]   Hopefully he'll find some people at Twitter who he can empower
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.400]   and trust to make these content moderation decisions.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.500]   So he's not drawn into every single little battle, right?
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.600]   We do want him focused on the highest priority problems.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.500]   My point is just that I get that.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.800]   I just think that what he's learning and what we're living
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.600]   and seeing in real time is that there is no canonically right
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.900]   decision ever in this space.
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.100]   There's only a decision where some percentage will support
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.000]   and some percentage will always be against.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.900]   That's my point.
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.800]   Correct.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.500]   He did say when he took over he knew that would be the case.
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.300]   He said you will know I'm doing the good job when both sides
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.300]   are equally upset.
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.400]   Just to put a pin in it.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.200]   I think it's important for people to understand what the new
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:22.900]   policy is.
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.600]   So I'm just going to quickly read it just to hang on.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.900]   Sorry, hang on one sec before you get to because I think the
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.400]   philosophical point rather than the specific one is an important
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.800]   one and I just want to respond to what you said and have sacks
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.800]   respond to this in the case of the points you make around the
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.500]   Twitter files.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.300]   And by the way, I don't agree with any of the moderation
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.500]   decisions personally.
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.600]   So I don't think that someone should be suspended for posting
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.500]   public information.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.600]   I don't think someone should be suspended for saying controversial
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.100]   things.
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.200]   That's my personal opinion.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.000]   Just so I'm clear on that because I know that you know that
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.400]   we describe yourself as a libertarian speech.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.500]   Yeah, libertarian.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:09:59.800]   Sure.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.300]   Okay, got it.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:00.800]   Sure.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.400]   And and so in this particular case, I think what really irked
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.500]   me I was trying to identify why it made me so angry yesterday.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.200]   It triggered me.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:09.900]   It really did.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.800]   And I think the reason was that in the case of the Twitter file
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.300]   points, it was a minority.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.000]   It was a minority that was affected.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.900]   It was one person that was affected because the majority wanted
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.400]   to do that thing to that person.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.900]   And I think in this case, it's that the minority wants to affect
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.600]   the majority in the sense that Elon has aggregated this control
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.300]   and this power over moderation and he's benefiting himself and
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.400]   a few people that have private planes and he's shutting down
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.500]   hundreds of tweet feeds Twitter feeds that are using publicly
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.600]   available information.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:48.300]   And so it feels even more onerous of a use of power and influence
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.600]   because he's taking he's doing something that benefits a small
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.500]   number and affecting a large larger number.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.800]   Whereas the alt whereas the other one was affecting a small
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.600]   number that benefited a large number because that's what a lot
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.900]   of people wanted to see happen.
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.600]   A lot of people wanted to see Trump suspended and it wasn't
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.200]   right either.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.900]   Okay, I don't know if that if that makes sense.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.700]   Yeah, we understand your position completely.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.800]   I just want to add to that in this policy.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.100]   I think it's very important to understand what he is saying
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.500]   about this accounts dedicated to sharing someone else's live
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.500]   location are going to be suspended going forward.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.600]   You can still share your own location obviously content
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.300]   required, you know content for public engagements, you know,
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.900]   the president is speaking somewhere whatever you just really
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.700]   can't be persistently consistently tracking an individual
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.800]   otherwise known in you know, sorry, Jason, if any are talking
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:42.100]   but Jason if NPR is live tweeting sure Jerome Powell speech
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.700]   perfect problem XYZ location not a problem if they do Jerome
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:52.300]   Powell's location for the next year for the next year 10 times
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.600]   a week on his off duty on duty.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.800]   That's the thing we're talking about.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.200]   I'm just saying like let's just say he gives a speech every
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   week. Is that illegal?
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.000]   No, if you're really funny if you're giving a speech at a
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.600]   public place where you've announced that you're going to
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.000]   be appearing at a certain time and place you've already made
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.700]   a problem where you're going to be what we're talking about
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.300]   is and what what what Elon Jett was showing was a live stream
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.300]   of precision GPS coordinates over a sustained period of time.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.600]   Yes, and not to be too dramatic about it.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.400]   But if you look at like the weapons are so successfully being
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.500]   used in Ukraine right now, they're all precision GPS guided
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.700]   now right now you have to be a state actor to get a hold of
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.900]   those weapons, but you could imagine over the next decade
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.100]   that having someone's precise GPS coordinates over a sustained
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:37.900]   period of time.
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.600]   It would be pretty easy to target them for and not to be
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.400]   too dramatic here, but for assassination.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.200]   No, that is a security risk.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.400]   There's no way around that.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.100]   I brought this up with Palmer lucky man.
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.700]   I'm scared that Duke come at me anytime when I get my jet.
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.700]   I don't want Palmer lucky taking me out.
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.600]   Yo Palmer.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.800]   I'm sorry, dude.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.000]   Do not take me out.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   What I'm going to get my jet.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.800]   I'll be on my first flight and he's just going to send a drone
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.500]   in but look, let's talk about hypocrisy for a second.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.900]   Okay, because here we go.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.300]   Let's let's talk about CNN's hypocrisy in the media's hypocrisy
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.800]   because earlier in the week they were saying that any criticism
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.800]   of Yoel Roth who is Twitter's former head of trust and safety
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.400]   amounted to a threat to his safety and they had this like
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.000]   theatrical tweet where they claimed he was having to flee
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.600]   his house, which a lot of people found pretty preposterous.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.200]   They were basically saying that public criticism of someone
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.200]   who has put themselves out there to engage in a public debate
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.000]   who's writing op-eds for the New York Times.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.400]   That is a threat to safety.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   However, publishing someone's real-time location on a continuous
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.500]   basis so they can be talking about it.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.700]   It's not intellectually consistent.
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:43.800]   It's not intellectually consistent.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.300]   It's not a threat to safety.
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:44.700]   That is not.
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.600]   If one of those two things is a threat to safety, it's the real-time
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.600]   doxing of somebody.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:49.900]   Yes.
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.600]   I think we now understand why Elon did what he did.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.800]   He basically had an incident in LA in which the safety of his
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.700]   kid was threatened because he's got stalkers coming after him.
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.500]   So his safety is a real issue.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.300]   It's not like a made-up issue.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.400]   But why should that look?
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.600]   Yeah, why should his personal experience affect the usage of
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.000]   the service that hundreds of millions of people use and that's
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.700]   the big issue.
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.500]   The decision should not be based on what affects him personally.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.100]   There needs to be a principle basis.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.600]   Yeah, it's be a principle basis for any decision about content
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.800]   moderation or censorship.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.600]   Maybe in the first few hours that decision it wasn't handled
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.400]   perfectly because there wasn't a principle basis.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.800]   But since then one has been put in place.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.200]   The principle basis is what J Cal showed and this applies to
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:30.900]   everybody.
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.100]   And so, you know now it's a debate about whether that policy
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:34.800]   makes sense.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.800]   Now is Elon just as arbitrary and capricious as the former
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.200]   executives who are running trust and safety at Twitter.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.900]   I don't think so for two reasons.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.200]   Number one, he's promised transparency.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.300]   He said that when we ban or shadow ban an account there has
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.400]   to be a reason for it and you have to be alerted to it.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   In other words, none of the shadows stuff.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.100]   No shadow.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.800]   You need to be informed.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.600]   You get your speeding ticket.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.300]   You get your ticket.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.800]   It's there right no more shadow that is different.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.200]   And then the second thing is that and again, I think you
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.400]   could say they didn't do this perfectly in the first few
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.300]   hours, but there needs to be a principle basis for a censorship
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.000]   decision and it needs to be applied to everyone equally.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.800]   And so far we haven't seen any basis for believing that he's
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   not applying this principle equally.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.900]   I mean still very early.
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.400]   Whereas the former rulers at Twitter were indulging their
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.000]   personal bias and personal preferences and who were they
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:22.500]   were banning.
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.700]   There are two standards of justice.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.300]   If you were someone who is allied with them, it was almost
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.000]   impossible to get censored no matter how hateful your tweets
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   were. But if you were somebody on the other side of the
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.200]   political debate, they were eager to suppress you.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.400]   And I think that at least so far Elon has not shown that type
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.800]   of selectivity.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.300]   He selected against someone that put him at personal risk.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.800]   I think yes, and so here's what I'm saying.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:53.000]   Yeah, if that's where the decision had stayed, yeah, then
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.900]   I would agree with you, but I think that since then they've
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.500]   put in place they've undergirded that decision.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.800]   I got a personal policy.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.000]   I think those sites are I think those tweet streams are cool.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.500]   I think there's some cool tweets streams that some of these
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.700]   people run and there are hundreds of them and they're actually
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.100]   kind of cool.
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.500]   You can see where these different labor of people tracking
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.700]   people's planes like where Air Force One is they show all these
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.200]   different planes it look and whether or not the FAA should
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.600]   be publishing the state as a separate question, but it's on
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.600]   the open internet.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.900]   It is already there.
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.900]   It's like turning off the RSS feed from the open internet
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.100]   to protect himself.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.500]   Okay, that's why it feels owner.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.000]   So here's the part I agree with which is I think this policy
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.800]   with regard to plane specifically is going to be futile.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.100]   Yeah, it's going to be at best harm reduction because as long
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.500]   as there's many ways to publish this information on Reddit,
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:37.900]   it's pointless.
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.200]   It's on Facebook.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.300]   So listen, I think this whole I think this whole policy on
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.900]   Twitter is a little bit of a red herring.
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.600]   I think the real issue the real underlying issue is that the
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.400]   FAA is publishing these I count numbers thereby making every
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.700]   plane personally identifiable.
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.200]   I don't think there's I have a counter to it.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.000]   If I'm necessary, I have a counter to it actually sacks if
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   I may what we saw whether you agree with it or not with the
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   mass banning of certain individuals did actually silence
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.700]   them and take them out of the public square.
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.400]   One of the reasons in fact, you'll I'm wanting to buy Twitter.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.000]   So if you look at certain individuals, whether it's Milo
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.700]   Alex Jones Trump himself right on down the line when they
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.400]   got banned across all systems, it was dramatic in terms of
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.200]   the reach of the that information.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.900]   So because of the size and scale of YouTube Facebook Twitter,
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:27.600]   etc.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.400]   When they act in coordination, they can have a dramatic impact
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.000]   not a perfect impact but a dramatic which is why we have
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.800]   this issue of hey should 230 be rethought because when they
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.000]   act en masse, it is extraordinary what they can do to an
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.100]   individual they took.
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.800]   Yeah, Alex Joe.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.900]   How do you consume Alex Jones?
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.700]   You have to seek that out in a major way.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.200]   It's distinctly different Chamath last word.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.300]   And then we're moving on to what could be the greatest science
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.900]   corner ever in the history of all in pod final word.
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.100]   I think this is this is a great transition.
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.700]   We're about to talk about nuclear fusion.
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.400]   And my point is I don't care about any of this stuff.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.000]   Like I said, like this is my point is like the if you if you
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.500]   take like an average person, okay, you know, we are let's
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.500]   say awake 16 hours a day.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.900]   And you know, if you take out the time with our family, David
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.900]   the family is people that are related to you.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.900]   We'll get to can we DM sacks those people one more time.
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.500]   So he has that will send you their names.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.900]   But if you take that out and you take out, you know, exercising
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.500]   and you know, we also explain that to sacks.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.600]   That's when you increase your heart rate and sweat sacks.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.100]   The point is that you have let's just call it 12 hours, you
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.700]   know, a functional executive time that you can apply to a
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.400]   problem and you can break that down into these blocks, right?
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.900]   I would really love what is basically the smartest human and
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.900]   the most productive human of our generation to be filling those
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:04.100]   blocks with things that sort of like really transcend and
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.600]   increasingly and I agree that freedom of speech is important
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.700]   increasingly those buckets are being filled with things that
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:18.700]   are very low level and hyper tactical and are distractions
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.100]   at best to the to the path of free speech.
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:26.000]   And so I think that hopefully he gets all this shit under
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.900]   control over there.
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.200]   He finds a good executive team.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.500]   I would like to see him get back to landing rockets on barges
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.900]   getting to Mars.
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.100]   Let's get it getting to finish self-driving.
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.000]   We're almost there.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.500]   Chamath definitely has a point.
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.600]   But I just say one of the reasons why we don't care that
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:48.200]   much about this issue is because I think something to understand
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.100]   that's important is there are different kinds of speech and
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.300]   different kinds of speeches are different levels protection.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.900]   The fact of the matter is like business advertising is not as
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.500]   protected as political speech porn is not as protected as
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.700]   political speech political speech speech criticizing the
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.400]   people in power is the most protected category of speech
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.300]   because the founders of the country understood that the
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.700]   people in power will always try to insulate themselves from
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.700]   accountability by limiting that kind of speech, but that is
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.700]   precisely the kind of speech that the former rulers of Twitter
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   suppress the most and show the least sensitivity to so listen.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.200]   I mean is Ilan going to be the perfect content moderator?
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.900]   No, I mean nobody is nobody nobody is but I do not believe
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:31.200]   that puts him in the same category as you know, Vijaya Gaudi
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.200]   or Yoel Roth who showed no sensitivity for political speech.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.000]   He has indicated a desire to restore freedom of speech and
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.500]   I think they ultimately ended up in a good place.
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.000]   I want him to get us to Mars.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.100]   I want him to get us to Mars.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.600]   I don't let's move on to Twitter handles best science corner
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.900]   ever. So according to sources scientists work for the US
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.700]   government have achieved a net energy gain in a fusion reaction.
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.300]   No, no, not net energy gain get it right.
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.900]   We had ignition energy, which is very different from net energy
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.800]   game. Okay, hold on.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.200]   I know that you're in the anti camp.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.000]   Please let the science nerd have you you have to you have to
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.400]   say it correctly so that people understand what you're talking
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.700]   about. Let me just make it even simpler than explain to us.
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.700]   What fusion is Dr.
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.000]   Friedberg and explain to us why this could potentially change
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.700]   everything we did this on a on a show once before but I'll
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.300]   kind of do a quick kind of summary again, basically, if you
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.200]   take atomic nuclei, which are made of protons and neutrons,
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.700]   and they repel one another right because protons are positively
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:35.100]   charged. So they want to push apart from each other.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.800]   So with enough energy and enough density meaning that they're
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.600]   moving fast enough and they're close enough.
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.200]   They'll overcome their repulsion and jam into each other when
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.100]   that happens.
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:48.200]   Some energy is released because the total mass of the fusion of
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.900]   those those nuclei is actually less than those nuclei when
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.800]   they're on their own.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.800]   And so some energy is released and that energy drives a chain
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.500]   reaction.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:05.800]   And so fusion is this concept that is fundamental to physics
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.100]   and fundamental to the energy driver of our universe.
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:15.000]   So the star in our in our sky, the sun is driven by fusion and
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.300]   only about 15% of the mass of the sun at the center is dense
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.900]   enough to actually drive fusion.
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:25.000]   So the big challenge with fusion is how do you get these these
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.900]   atomic nuclei close enough together and moving fast enough
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.800]   that they'll actually fuse and release energy and that's super
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.100]   hard.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.400]   The reason it happens in the sun is because the sun has so much
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.600]   mass that the gravity pulls all those particles together, they
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.800]   get close enough, they get hot enough, they move fast enough,
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.600]   and fusion happens, boom, all this energy comes out and every
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.300]   day we're warm.
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.600]   Now, to do it on Earth is very difficult.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.700]   But if we can do it, what happens when you fuse nuclei
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.400]   together is you don't release any this isn't like a radioactive
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.600]   fission reaction.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:01.100]   You release energy that can be harnessed to drive our systems
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.100]   are technology.
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:02.800]   How is it done?
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.200]   So in the 1950s, you know, this was theorized, hey, we could
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.500]   do fusion on Earth, we got to get a really, really dense plasma
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.300]   meaning the atomic nuclei and the electrons have kind of gone
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.100]   off the atoms.
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.800]   And it's just the nuclei spinning apart.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.600]   You got to get them to move super fast, like 10s of millions
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.100]   of degrees Celsius, and you got to get them really close
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:20.600]   together.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.100]   So how the heck can you do this?
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:26.100]   So there's a couple of concepts to do this, one of which is
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.200]   called inertial confinement, which is where you basically
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.700]   create a little pellet of the material, you're going to try
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.800]   and get to fuse, and you put a ton of energy on the outside,
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.300]   you compress it really hard, really fast.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.300]   And when you compress it really hard, really fast, and you
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.400]   can get it to be done in a perfect sphere, and you can get
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.900]   it to collapse on itself very quickly without, you know, kind
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.500]   of shooting all over the place, enough of those particles
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.900]   will come close enough together fast enough hot enough, and
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:53.900]   they will start to fuse.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.600]   Another way is through magnetic confinement, where you use
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.300]   magnetic fields to create a really hot plasma, get it to spin
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.200]   around or to move.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.500]   And then the magnet brings that super hot plasma closer and
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.300]   closer and closer together until all those particles are moving
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.800]   fast, and they're dense enough that they start to fuse.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.500]   So you know, one is called magnetic confinement, the other
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.700]   one's inertial confinement.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.000]   And so what we saw happen this week is at the National Ignition
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Facility, which is a facility that was built starting in 1997.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.500]   And they've spent about three and a half billion dollars to
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.400]   date, they demonstrated a net energy output from the fusion
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.800]   reaction of an inertial confinement system.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.700]   And what that means is they took a little pellet, and that
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:39.000]   pellet was made up of deuterium and tritium, the atomic nuclei
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.400]   that they use the particles that they use are deuterium, which
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.400]   is a proton and a neutron stuck together, and then tritium,
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.100]   which is a proton and two neutrons stuck together.
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.300]   And the reason they use those two combinations is of all the
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.300]   different ways you could fuse nuclei together.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   This has the best energy output of any kind of reaction.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Freeberg, what actually happened this time that made this work
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.800]   for what apparently only $3 billion. You said you didn't say
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.800]   3 trillion, 3 billion, three, about a third of Yeah, about a
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.500]   third of what Sam Bankman fraud stole. We have done something
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:17.300]   here. Allegedly. So what actually happened that is so dramatic
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.500]   that we have a press conference, everybody's losing their mind.
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.900]   So yeah, I just want to highlight one more thing about
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.300]   why this is so hard. You have to get such an incredible density,
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.600]   you have to get an incredible energy. So high temperature and
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.100]   high density, that confining those atoms and not letting them
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:39.100]   escape and, you know, basically dissolve before they fuse is
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.700]   super difficult. It requires so much energy in such a controlled
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.900]   way in such a perfect and precise way that all of the digital
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.700]   technology, the magnets, all the measurement systems, all the
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.500]   software, it's taken us decades to get everything that allows us
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.100]   to do this today. And now we're at the point that we may be able
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.300]   to start to realize production scale, kind of versions of this.
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.700]   So what they did is they had a small deuterium and tritium
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.800]   pellet. And they shown 192 lasers onto this container that
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.300]   held that little fuel. 192 lasers, the whole thing happened
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.700]   in a billionth of a second, the lasers pulsed, boom, here's an
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.400]   image of it. And as they did that, they, you know, basically
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:26.400]   x rays kind of hit the sphere, this little BB, if you will, BB
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.700]   kind of thing and compressed it and it compressed so quickly.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.100]   And with such heat, and it didn't dissipate because it was
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.600]   done so precisely, all the lasers hit at the exact right
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.800]   time, boom, this thing compressed, and then energy came
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.400]   out. And the energy that came out that was measured was one
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.500]   and a half times the energy that kind of went into that reaction.
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.900]   And here's a chart that that I'll show you from the National
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.100]   Ignition Facility, which shows just how inefficient the system
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.900]   still is. And this isn't even speaking to to Chamath's point,
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:27:00.700]   but basically these guys lose 90% of the energy that they put
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:04.900]   into the center of the system, only 10% is actually used to
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.400]   drive the compression, the rest of it is lost. And there's a
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.400]   lot of ways to improve the efficiency of the system from
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.700]   here. But basically, they put two megajoules in, they got
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:18.000]   three megajoules out. And so it was the first proof point
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.800]   production proof point in the 70 years that we've been
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.200]   theorizing about nuclear fusion here on planet Earth, that this
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.700]   is possible, and it's real. Now, this is these kind of inertial
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:32.600]   confinement systems. There are 33 private technology companies
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:37.100]   today that have raised about three to $4 billion so far this
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:41.400]   year, to pursue several other technologies, besides what the
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.100]   National Ignition Facility is showing to try and build
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.700]   production ready versions of nuclear fusion. And so these 33
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.700]   companies are using a bunch of different types of tools, one of
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.700]   which is the tokamak. If you show the image, I'll show you
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.000]   this one. There it is. Yeah, tokamak. This is what we talked
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.540]   about. That is the magnetic spinning thing that looks like
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:04.300]   Iron Man's arc reactor. Yeah, based it on Yeah, yeah, you
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.580]   create a plasma, you basically speed up the hydrogen nuclei
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.020]   super, super fast, these uterium and tritium nuclei, super, super
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.440]   fast. And then you use magnets and the magnetic field has to
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.160]   precisely squeeze the plasma, squeezing and squeezing and
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.120]   squeezing it. And if it's slightly off in even the tiniest
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.200]   way, think about a balloon, right? If you put a pinhole in a
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.480]   balloon, everything escapes from the balloon. You got your
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.040]   account. That's how technically hard this is. You're basically
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.200]   trying to create a balloon with a magnetic field and you're
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.440]   trying to keep the gas and you're trying to make it smaller
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.000]   and smaller and smaller. And if any tiny hole emerges, the
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.720]   entire plasma.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.580]   Is that what happens in Uranus?
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:47.700]   Like when you're trying to hold in the Wagyu? Anyway, let me ask
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:52.220]   this question then about the consistency of this and then
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:56.120]   we'll go to you, Chamath. Can they do it consistently? Or do
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.700]   you think this is like they got lucky once? Or are we going to
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.700]   be sitting here a year from now and they're like we put in two
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.260]   when we got out six. So we did it five times.
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:08.220]   Yeah. So now we've proven that humans can do this. Okay. Which
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.820]   is look, I mean, I want to give you guys some and I know kind of
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.280]   some of Chamath concerns, which is how humans can recreate the
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.960]   sun is what we this comes down to. No, no, no, I want to just
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.840]   say one like, even close. I want to say one important thing from
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:28.640]   a historical context. All breakthrough technology starts
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.120]   out seeming impossibly large, impossibly expensive and
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:37.140]   impossibly slow. The human genome project 20 years ago cost
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.600]   $100 million to sequence the human genome. Today, we can do
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.920]   it in a couple of minutes for $100. Okay, credible. The first
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:49.320]   computer, the ENIAC computer had 500 flops of compute capacity,
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.180]   it filled a room, it cost $8 million to build. 20 years
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.400]   later, we had a mainframe.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.460]   20 years later, all the wrong No, this is all this emotional
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.560]   bullshit. You're using the wrong examples. Okay, let him finish.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.640]   Then you go to finish your sentence freeberg. And then we
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:07.040]   go. And today we have an iPhone that can do 2 trillion flops of
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.600]   compute in your pocket. I think that what we're seeing with
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.680]   fusion today is similar to what we saw with the ENIAC computer
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.800]   in the 1950s, which is the demonstration that compute is
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.760]   possible. And now we're seeing a demonstration that fusion is
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.400]   possible. And a lot of folks have anticipated this moment.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.000]   And they've invested ahead of this. Now, I don't know if any
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.080]   of these companies that are currently kind of being built
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.720]   are going to be production ready anytime soon. My estimate is
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.120]   that we will see production demonstration. Okay, fusion,
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.200]   here we go. 23 in the 2030s. So call it eight years from now
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.400]   plus, and then you'll see grid scale scale up in the 2040s. So
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.400]   this isn't something that's going to happen next year or two
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.120]   years for already happening. What are you talking about? Okay,
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.360]   now, Chamath your rebuttal. Oh my god, knowing you're a huge
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.840]   fan of solar. This is the most navel gazing head up your ass
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.760]   scientific bullshit. I've ever heard. Okay, couple points.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.880]   Let's start with the basics. The first is that there was no
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.180]   previous technical. Why are you being like, why are you angry?
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:09.680]   At me? I'm not angry. I find it so tiring hearing this. It's all
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.900]   syrup. You're a little triggered. He's right. Yeah.
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:15.380]   Why? Like, I don't get it. Because I don't find this
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.280]   intellectually honest. Okay, I find it intellectually
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.160]   dishonest. Let's keep
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:24.860]   on. Let me finish. Let me finish. Okay. When you talk
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.460]   about sequencing the genome, there was no alternative. So
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:32.640]   you're right. It was an enormous technical leap forward. When we
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:36.840]   built a computer, there was no analog. It was an enormous
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.320]   technical leap. And so you're right, we have a cost curve we
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.200]   don't understand. And then we iterate as rapidly as possible.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.260]   And all these innovations where we built an entire
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.520]   infrastructure to ride down the cost curve. The thing is, fusion
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:56.360]   energy exists today. It's called the sun, we actually know how to
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.240]   capture it at virtually no cost right now. So according to the
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.960]   IAEA, today, you can capture grid level solar energy for
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.960]   about 3 cents a kilowatt hour. That's as close to zero as we've
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.400]   ever been. And over the next 10 years, their forecast is it's
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.880]   going to get to one and a half cents. If you then want to store
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:20.040]   it, and you layer in storage costs will be at a whopping 3
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:25.280]   cents a kilowatt hour. That's where we are today. And so I
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.320]   think that fusion does exist. I do think that this is an
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.880]   incredible technical leap to replicate something that exists.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.040]   And I think that's where the intellectual dishonesty is, it
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:41.400]   does exist. It has been captured, it can be harnessed.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:45.040]   And there is a positive energy equation, just in a different
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.840]   modality that doesn't speak to these technically minded
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.920]   individuals, a couple of other points about what I saw. I think
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.800]   it's incredible what happened, okay. But just to make sure
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:33:00.120]   we're clear, this is 192 lasers, the size of three football
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:05.720]   fields, that consumed 322 megajoules of energy, which then
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.640]   ultimately delivered two megajoules to a target, which
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.200]   then released three. So this is why I'm saying we had positive
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.000]   what's called ignition energy, we did not have positive
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   electrical energy captured. So yeah, could we figure this out?
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.320]   Absolutely. Can we then shrink the three football fields down
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:25.400]   to something that looks the size of a laptop? We possibly could,
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.240]   will it take 20 or 30 years? Possibly. But in the meanwhile,
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:33.320]   if the goal is unlimited, costless energy, you're on that
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.600]   cost curve already.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.040]   Yeah, but why can't it be both? So you said I was being
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:41.120]   intellectually dishonest. What was I dishonest? Yeah, you're
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.080]   comparing what you're saying is right. Yes, you can get you
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.440]   would you seem to be an agreement? Like, yeah, I just
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.640]   think that I think that you're trying to say that this is an
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.440]   entirely new thing. No, it's a different approach to a thing
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.120]   we've already beaten and basically captured.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.040]   Let me bring what I would argue to my and I think this is
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.000]   important be the net energy you can capture on, say, a football
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.440]   field sized facility from solar is, you know, a tiny fraction of
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.320]   the energy you could generate from a football field sized
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.240]   fusion reactor. And that's why the argument would be like,
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.920]   hey, you know, when we were developing computers, hey, we
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.360]   have abacus is we shouldn't be developing computers. And I
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.200]   think that's, that's the analogy I would use here.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.520]   This is why the cost per kilowatt hour is what the the
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.880]   levelized cost of energy tries to do. It tries to, to normalize
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.160]   that argument away, because everybody would say that, hey,
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.320]   hold on a second, you're going to need plainfuls of this or
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.400]   boatloads of that. And people said, No, what's the levelized
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.800]   cost of energy? How what is the cost per kilowatt hour to
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.960]   generate energy? And what I'm saying is, that is an absolute
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.880]   scale, and free is zero, and we're at 1.5 cents.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.600]   Here's what I would say once check out one sec, the okay,
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.400]   come off, the opportunity here is not necessarily about cost
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:01.000]   reduction, it is about scalability. And if hydrogen is
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.280]   abundant, which it is on this planet, it is nearly infinitely
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.720]   abundant, we can take that hydrogen, and we can scale up
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.120]   energy and electricity production in a way that is
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.440]   unimaginable compared to solar. And I don't think that solar
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.920]   should be excluded. Solar is key today and should be scaled
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.960]   up. And I'm 100% agreement with you. But the scalability to go
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.000]   100 x if we want to make 100 times more electricity, I think
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.960]   we need fusion. And I think that's feasible.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:30.840]   So I think we have reached a good settlement here. Chamath
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.520]   you're saying, Hey, listen, we're getting solar down so
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.920]   cheap, we can solve this problem, all forms of energy.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.000]   Okay, great. We are solving that. So for our needs today,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.360]   and then what freeberg is saying, but what if you had
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.880]   unlimited a thing that we can't even imagine? Beautiful. Now,
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.040]   watch, as I get sacks involved in a science conversation. He
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:57.880]   has zero interest in Mr. David sacks. If in fact, there was 100%
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.960]   more free electricity available in this time frame, the next
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.680]   100 to 200 x 100 x the available energy, in other words, supply
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.400]   of energy just becomes flooded. And it's free, essentially, what
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.560]   would be the geopolitical reaction on planet Earth in
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.840]   terms of this incredible rivalry, rivalry we have with
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:23.360]   China, and for humanity on a political basis? Such a good
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.400]   question. J. Go ahead, sir. Good question. Here we go. Thank you.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.840]   World's Greatest moderator. Why don't we let freeberg answer?
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.160]   No, no, you're the politics guy. Get in there. Take a second to
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:32.640]   think it through.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.280]   He has thought about this. Let's I want to hear his answer. I
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.520]   actually want to hear your answer. Yes. You know, in a
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:42.040]   world where you know, energy becomes more abundant, David
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.200]   hasn't been paying attention, guys. This is what he's trying
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.160]   to say. Tucker,
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:53.360]   Jake, I'll call your intellectual dishonesty and
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.080]   raise you a steel man. Go ahead.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:37:01.120]   I love you. I love you. You know, I do. I like to have a
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.200]   great night on Monday night, a Sunday night. Great. Let's talk
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:08.160]   later. I just want to be together last week. You call me
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.480]   petty to I think we're well, here's what I want to be clear.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.080]   I think that I'm just glad you guys are fighting not mean sex.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.280]   Guys, please let me finish. Okay, I think that this
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.640]   breakthrough is really valuable. I think it's interesting to see
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.800]   that these kinds of scientific breakthroughs continue to happen
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.320]   in government sponsored facilities and not private
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.520]   companies. And I think that that's probably where a lot of
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.160]   these innovations will continue to come from because look at the
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.160]   scale of what had to be built. Three football fields and 322
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.280]   megajoules of energy and 192 lasers. This is really
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.320]   complicated, expensive stuff. I'm an enormous fan of these
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.760]   kinds of scientific breakthroughs. I want to be
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:48.240]   clear. I think that where I struggle is translating this
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:52.920]   into actually an investable area. And I worry that this is
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:57.480]   going to consume lots of money by folks that could otherwise
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:01.280]   put money to work in things that will actually pull forward our
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.360]   energy independence and energy abundance sooner and faster. So
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.640]   for example, you know, there are all kinds of things that we
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.800]   could do to secondary, ternary, third, fourth and fifth
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.600]   generation batteries that aren't happening today. There are a
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.760]   bunch of things that we could do to actually create an
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.480]   infrastructure of green hydrogen. And the the
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.680]   simplistic answer is we could do it all. But the reality is
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:27.400]   money is finite, and we can't. And all I'm observing is I do
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.120]   think that more practical things that do have geopolitical
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:34.280]   ramifications sooner are not going to get funded because
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:38.680]   people do get enraptured by this. And my skepticism is that
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:42.600]   this is still in the realm of government sponsored research
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:47.080]   and is not really an area that for profit private companies
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.320]   can tackle. And so I would rather those for profit
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.800]   companies, for example, why combinator just today, put out
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.240]   something where they were, you know, call to action a request
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.280]   for startups in climate. And when you look at that list,
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.160]   those are really practical, investable areas. And I just
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.520]   want to make sure that the capital allocators that listen
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:08.480]   to this, weigh those equally. I am glad. I'm glad that the US
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.800]   government did this. I hope they do more of this. But if you're
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.200]   asking me quite honestly, I would rather the next $10
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:18.880]   billion go into energy efficiency HVAC, then fusion
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.080]   because a fusion exists and B, I think it's going to happen at an
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:28.000]   innovative bench scale level by the government and not by a
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:28.440]   particle.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.840]   Let me let me just respond to that real quick. Tomorrow. I
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.200]   think that the idea of allocating our resources as a
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.120]   society should be done on kind of, you know, on a portfolio
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:44.320]   basis, 80% on the pragmatic near term, 15% on the kind of next
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:48.680]   gen and 5% on the moonshot. And this maybe starts to shift from
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:52.840]   the 5% to the 15%. Maybe it's still in the 5%. But I don't see
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.400]   kind of overfunding happening. So I'll tell you guys there was
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.680]   a survey done. There's 33 private companies in fusion that
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:02.720]   are kind of fusion companies today. VC back eight new this
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:07.120]   year. So the number is kind of increased by 33% this year. And
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.600]   so far this year, those companies have raised around
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.640]   three to $4 billion, which by the way,
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:16.280]   is a fraction of what was done by 15 minute delivery companies
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.240]   for convenience stores.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.000]   Exactly my point. And and by the way, the biggest funding is
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.320]   happening in iter, which is the largest construction project in
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:27.640]   Europe. And this is a $30 billion production scale fusion
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.800]   demonstration system that should be online by the end of the
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.480]   2020 government sponsored government sponsored. Yeah. And
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.320]   so to my point, I'm a huge fan of government sponsored
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:39.720]   research. We get finally, the first science corner, everybody
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:43.160]   brace themselves. It's the first science corner, where David Sacks
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.920]   has the cherry sacks. Here we go. Come on, you can do it. You
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.520]   can do it. Mr. David Sacks.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.680]   What was your question? Your question was a little bit was
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.280]   was not a
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.360]   let me reframe. Okay, I'm coming in. What's the geopolitical
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.720]   impact if this does happen 100x energy? It's fantastic for the
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.440]   United States if it actually happens. And the reason is, if
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:05.120]   you look across the world, there's this thing in politics,
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.240]   known as resource curse, where the worst governments, the most
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:13.560]   despotic governments tend to be in the countries that have the
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.680]   biggest natural resources, ironically, so the countries
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.600]   that have huge amounts of petroleum or other kinds of
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:25.480]   minerals, they've tend to have pretty corrupt governments. And
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:29.480]   the reason for that is that if you're sitting on a giant oil
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.960]   reserve, you don't need to make anything else work, you just
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.760]   fight over who gets to control that oil reserve. And that's
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:38.480]   what politics ends up being, you don't need to create policies
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.120]   that foster innovation, or attract knowledge workers,
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:46.200]   right, you just basically mine that oil. So if all of a sudden,
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.560]   you're talking about turning energy into a software problem,
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.480]   or an innovation problem, that looks a lot more like the
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.400]   software industry. That's an area where the United States has
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.480]   a huge advantage. And yeah, I think it would pull the rug out
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.400]   from under many countries all over the world in favor of the
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.840]   United States. I mean, it's a big if because where I agree
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:10.400]   with Chamath is this stuff still seems pretty far off. And it's
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.080]   still pretty unproven from a commercial standpoint. But I
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.800]   agree with freeberg, why not try investing in and cultivating it
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.600]   and see where it goes.
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:22.500]   Okay, fantastic. This was a fantastic science corner, where
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.580]   we actually engage David Sachs, which country
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.740]   did you disagree with their J cow?
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:32.140]   All right, take it easy. Yes, I just want to let you know, I
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:36.020]   think you like that answer, right? Well, I love all of your
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:39.140]   intellectual enough for you. Or was I love your intellectually?
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.700]   I love it wasn't
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:46.020]   knows I was a steel person. felt silver silver silver manning.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.220]   But I love what your intellectually silver person.
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.860]   Yes, you're silver. They're silver thing.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.500]   Was that was that platinum, gold or silver?
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.380]   I think that's your you're in platinum with some diamond dust.
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:01.180]   I just can I just say spent a couple nights together this past
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:03.580]   week has really really done the mood of the show. I mean, when
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.820]   you guys go out and drink together and you guys are
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:11.260]   left our asses off Sunday night. Can I just say, we Saxon I had
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.940]   the best 48 hours together in a decade. This is Sunday night.
[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.900]   It turns out Chris rock and Chappelle are playing at the
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.540]   Chase Center, where Chamath used to own a piece of the Warriors,
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:27.180]   right. And this incredible arena has this incredible show. And you
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.820]   know, me and Saxon, some friends will leave it at that go to the
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:34.340]   show. Our bestie dream on is at the show. So I text Dre and I'm
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:36.620]   like, Hey, you're going to see Chris rock by chance tonight
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:40.180]   with Chappelle? Say yes, sir. I said, Hey, we're gonna go with a
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:42.620]   couple of friends. Maybe we roll together hang out after the
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:48.340]   show. We go. And after the game after the show, which was
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:53.340]   incredible. We go backstage and I'm sorry to the to the practice
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:56.300]   court. And we're hanging out with dream on in the practice
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:00.460]   court with Dave Chappelle, Dave Chappelle, and I start shooting
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:04.260]   hoops. David Sacks is talking to Chris rock about free speech.
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:09.140]   Steph Curry comes out and starts giving Dave Chappelle and Jay cow
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:14.580]   a shooting lessons. Where Chappelle and I are breaking
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:19.140]   like old men, you know, you know, on a concrete court, all
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:22.300]   of a sudden, Steph says, Hey, Jay, how you got it? And by the
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:25.420]   way, he's fan of the show. He says, you're short every time.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.260]   And just, you know, hit the backboard, you got to go long,
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:31.100]   then he tells Chappelle, you got to change this. All of a sudden,
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.460]   we start hitting shots like, you know, we're on the rain,
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.260]   injuries, you're raining, freeze, rain. It was literally
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.220]   like cut into here were these mid range jumpers or threes. I
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:42.900]   was a free throw line extended free throw line extended cut
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:47.140]   into here rain man and rain dance from a long came Polly
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.060]   rain dance rain.
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.780]   Let it rain.
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:54.140]   Rain is
[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:57.780]   literally
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:02.020]   I was hitting brick after brick, rest in peace, Philip Seymour
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:07.020]   Hoffman. So then we're chilling. And Saxon are talking to Dave
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:07.500]   Chappelle.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.740]   Joe Lakeham owner of the Warriors are there the majority
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.740]   owner, you know, as opposed to you being a minority owner.
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.220]   Chamath
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.900]   that's right.
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:22.060]   The only person who drops more names is Phil Hellmuth. I mean,
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.980]   absolutely. I'm trying to catch up anymore.
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:28.020]   No, he's only got three names.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:31.540]   Saxon, am I leaving? I want to say it's so bad, but I'm not
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:34.820]   gonna say not dancing. So brutal. There'll be zero docks.
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:41.660]   So we I kid you not. Chappelle comes over and says, Jacob,
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:47.100]   fact, you guys want to go to after to do it. Go go see me do
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:50.140]   a show at like 1am at this like local comedy club with 70 seats.
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:57.580]   I said word. Yes, we go at 1am. Chappelle sits on stage, smoking
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:58.340]   cigarettes.
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.420]   And
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:06.420]   doing 90 second pauses, and then having a beer and
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.820]   interacting with the audience. And does a two hour set after
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.460]   doing this set with Chris rock at the Chase Center. Me and Saxon
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:19.980]   Draymond hilariously laughing. The stuff Chappelle is a genius.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.660]   And when you see his show and Chris rock, by the way, he puts
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.380]   a tight set together. I mean, Chappelle's got this
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:29.100]   storytelling thing where he kind of meanders a little bit and
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.980]   then he hits you with it. But Chris rock is just bang, bang,
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.260]   bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. Extraordinary, just two
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:39.220]   incredible minds at the top of their game artists, artists at
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:43.700]   the top of their game, doing what society needs. But more
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:47.420]   importantly, doing what David Saxon I needed, which was to
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:51.140]   laugh our asses off together and remember our friendship. So it
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.060]   was a great night out. I want to say to bestie Draymond Dave
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:58.100]   Chappelle and Chris rock. Thank you. The David Sacks J. Cal
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:01.220]   bestie friendship has never been stronger. I don't know about
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.420]   freeberg and Chamath that seems to be on the rocks.
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:07.420]   Yeah, it's weird. We'll be in. We'll be we'll be vacationing
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:11.740]   together next week. So I love I love freeberg. Yeah. Well, well,
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.180]   we are going to be whatever, whatever's going on. We'll take
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:15.180]   a walk and figure it out.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.900]   Well, I just want to say the alliances amongst the besties
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:21.740]   people. I'll be honest, I got mad at freeberg when he edited
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:24.460]   that Google bit to say the exact opposite of what he actually
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:27.980]   said that we don't bring that up. Yeah, just beep that. But
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.500]   yes, that is the thing that bothered me. I have to be
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.340]   honest. That's you playing to the crowd versus you being
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.260]   honest and telling what you think freeberg that freeberg
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:39.260]   can let me put that in the form of a question freeberg has your
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:43.260]   fame as the sultan of science. Because listen, you nobody knew
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.980]   who you were outside of Silicon Valley before this. Has it
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.460]   impacted your ability to speak?
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:52.740]   No, no, no, not my family. Look, I'll be I'll be honest. And I'll
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:55.140]   speak openly about this. I had said that there could probably
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:59.740]   be a significant headcount reduction of like 75% at Google
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.940]   and the business could keep operating. And I took it out.
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:06.100]   And I took it out because I have a lot of friends that work at
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.980]   Google. Google is a close partner of mine. They're an
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:12.860]   investor of mine. And frankly, I just want to be careful about
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:15.260]   that. It's not something I commonly do. You know, as you
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.140]   guys know, I usually speak my mind pretty clearly, but I was
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.340]   just trying to be respectful. And that's the reason I did it.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:23.260]   You know, so that was fine. What I'm saying is not that it's
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:27.820]   just that the part that you edited in actually made it seem
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.300]   like you were not saying that at all. But the opposite, I think
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.140]   if you had cut the whole thing, it would have been more honest.
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:36.420]   So to keep that other thing in actually led the perception of
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:40.500]   the opposite. So I think that I think no, no, I don't want to
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.900]   trigger it. I'm saying, but I think you should have a
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.980]   principle. I don't hold on very often tomorrow. Like, yeah, I
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:48.660]   know. I think that we should just have a principle to not
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:51.140]   play to what the perception of what we say should be,
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.020]   especially if it means we could be saying the opposite of what
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:55.460]   we actually mean. That's all
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:59.780]   intellectual honesty is a best tenant. It's a best tenant. I
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.540]   think so. Absolutely. Bestie 10. Always and the other bestie
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:04.620]   tenant besties always come back together. If we have a fight, we
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:06.580]   always come back together. Saks.
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:12.340]   Can I'm still mad at you? Just kidding. Okay, but just talking
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:15.660]   about hypocrisy. I mean, so how great was Sunday night? How
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:17.980]   great was that gets up there and he gets like right out of the
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:20.820]   gate. He's attacking woke right out of the gate.
[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:23.740]   Swinging came out swinging like Will Smith.
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.700]   shooksmith. You mean?
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:31.460]   shooksmith. He took down Will Smith. I mean, the Will Smith
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:36.660]   takedown, which you will see in this special is so complete. It
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:40.740]   is just chef's kiss. But how great was his set? Let's say
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.380]   just give Chris Rock his flowers.
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:44.740]   He did he did he fillet and fricassee?
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:49.420]   He, he did. But I thought the more important part of the set
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:53.020]   was the he came right out like calling out all this, you know,
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:57.740]   you know, holier than thou woke stuff. Yeah. And there was that
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.140]   undercurrent to Chappelle's set as well.
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:04.740]   And also he said, Listen, words can't hurt you. Unless you write
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:09.660]   them on a piece of paper and time to a brick. We these a
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:12.740]   bigger point right now and this does tie into our first story is
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:15.940]   I think comedians look at Twitter as a place to get
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.940]   canceled, not a place to be part of the discourse. And that's a
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:23.300]   huge loss that's indicative of our society being broken. And
[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:28.860]   it's incredibly important that these comedians be allowed to
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:34.860]   mock and to speak and to step over the line and challenge us
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:39.220]   as citizens in a free society. And we should cherish them. And
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:42.740]   we should not even try to cancel them, let them cross the line,
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:45.780]   let them say things that make us uncomfortable, so that we can
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:49.020]   understand ourselves and our society better. And I just want
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:52.380]   to say, Why can't you include lives of tick tock in that? Oh,
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:57.500]   do we want to have a discussion about it? I can't go. I'm okay
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:00.500]   with mocking. I just don't start you guys. You did so well. Come
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:04.500]   on. Here we go. No, J. Cal cut it out. All right. Well, we have
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:09.780]   two more science corners to get. All right. You know what I mean?
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.860]   I just know what's wrong about the Coupa deal. And sex. This is
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:14.060]   right up your alley. Have you
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:18.060]   touched into it? To be honest? Oh, really? The thing you guys
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:22.940]   asked is like, you know, what signal will Elon's moves at
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:27.820]   Twitter be for the rest of the tech industry? I think the
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:32.420]   biggest wake up call is to actually PE companies. So if you
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:36.620]   play this out, and you think that Coupa is, you know,
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:41.140]   explain what is, please. Coupa is a is a software as a service
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:45.660]   company that does revenue management, I guess, or expense
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:49.260]   forecasting or some something in the financial realm. I don't
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:52.420]   particularly know to be honest. But anyways, this is a company
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:56.340]   that you know, was off 70 or 80% from the high like a lot of SAS
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:00.420]   companies were when rates started to go up. And they got
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:03.700]   this offer from from Toma Bravo. But here's what's so interesting
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:07.140]   about this deal. If you think that, you know, these guys
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:10.980]   bought a company, I'm just going to make up a number at 20 times
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:16.980]   EBITDA. Right. And, and you see Elon at Twitter, and you think,
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:20.420]   well, wait, maybe we can't cut 75%. But maybe we can cut 50%
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:23.940]   headcount and the company can still do well. And, you know,
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:27.620]   you take half of the expenses out of the business. All of a
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:29.580]   sudden, you know, if you're even two doubles, you're actually
[00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:34.820]   buying it at 10 times. So I think the thing that is the that
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:40.340]   is the real insight here is twofold private equity can still
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:43.420]   put out a lot of private credit to fund these deals. And SAS
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.580]   companies are perfect because they have huge free cash flow,
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.460]   right. So instead of funding it based on earnings, they can fund
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:52.100]   it based on ACV and ARR. So private equity will be super
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:56.820]   active. And to all these rifts basically show what the
[00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:59.020]   efficient frontier is for the number of employees you need to
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:02.340]   run a company. And if you can cut 50% of the headcount,
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:06.620]   private equity folks will do that. And so I think Cooper is
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:10.380]   like the canary in the coal mine, it is the beginning of
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:16.820]   what I suspect is a tidal wave of PE sponsored deals in tech
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:21.300]   companies, largely SAS, but may go into other realms, recurring
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:24.660]   revenue, that can go to these two things, tap the private
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:28.940]   credit markets and finance it based on ARR, and then fire 50%
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.780]   of the team and double earnings capacity.
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:31.620]   Zach, your thoughts.
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:35.500]   So on on Cooper, I thought the most interesting thing was just
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:39.620]   the we got a public comp, well, we got a comp on what private
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:43.620]   equity is paying for public companies right now. So the deal
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:47.620]   happened at an $8 billion valuation, that was a 31%
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:52.260]   premium to the public price. It was 8.4 times next 12 months
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:58.140]   revenue. And on a trailing basis, it was about 10.4 times
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:01.220]   the last 12 months revenue. And by the way, all the comments
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:04.980]   were around how what a rich price Toma Bravo was paying
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:07.580]   people generally thought they're paying a premium to the
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:13.740]   valuation. So it was 77% premium before the rumors came out that
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:16.900]   this was happening. So the premium, yeah, and there was and
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:21.300]   there was a there was a bidding war with Vista. And so it was a
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.020]   it was a really rich kind of deal that got done here.
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:27.700]   Right. So my point is that people thought this was a really
[00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:31.820]   rich deal. And yet the valuation multiples are so much lower than
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:36.020]   what private company founders expect. So remember, last year,
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:40.820]   at, you know, the peak, founders were thinking 100 times AR was
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:44.580]   normal 100 times, and, you know, you could roughly say, you know,
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:47.820]   AR is roughly equivalent to next 12 months revenue. It's not
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:51.420]   perfect, but it's roughly the case. So these founders were
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:56.980]   expecting evaluation, multiple 10 times what the public markets
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:00.300]   are paying. And the public more and actually, the public markets
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:04.740]   are half of where Toma Bravo was in this particular deal. So the
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:09.780]   public markets right now are valuing the median SaaS company
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:12.780]   at about five and a half times, and a high growth with that be
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:15.460]   for like a 20% year over year growing company. And they're
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:18.060]   valuing the high growth companies that may be eight
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:22.020]   times, you know, and Toma Bravo did this at 10 times. So that
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:24.300]   gives you a sense of what the ballpark is. And these are
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:26.860]   companies that are already public, they're at scale,
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:30.940]   they're doing roughly a billion dollars of AR, they have already
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:34.820]   kind of won their category, to some degree, whereas private
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:37.900]   companies are subscale. They're, you know, typically, you're
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:41.180]   talking about companies with one, five, 10, usually under
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:44.700]   $20 million of AR, they are, they're not de-risk, there's
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:48.060]   still a ton of risk. We've seen many, many SaaS companies
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:52.340]   fizzle out and plateau at 20 million of AR, never get to 100
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:55.300]   million, nevermind a billion. And yet these founders think
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:59.100]   that they're entitled to, you know, even in this market, 30
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:02.700]   to 40 times AR, no way. I mean, like, it's getting to the point
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:07.620]   now where, you know, maybe it should be 10 times 20 times like
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:11.140]   max, for that to be for a company that's growing two and a
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:14.220]   half, three x year over year. So I still think that like, so I
[00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.740]   think basically, what we're seeing here is even a good
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:19.900]   scenario, like a coupe acquisition that was done at a
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:23.580]   premium, like it's still a wake up call to the private markets
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.980]   that the valuations are still completely and utterly out of
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:26.380]   whack.
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.220]   Yeah, let me ask you a question, Zack. So this company was
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:33.580]   growing 45% last year, they're growing 35% this year. And they
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:38.180]   got this multiple. Why is it not worth a significantly higher
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:41.020]   multiple if a company is growing two and a half to three x, which
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:45.340]   is 250% 300%. And these guys are only growing 35%.
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:48.940]   Sure. I mean, it is. And that's what you're paying a premium
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:53.300]   for. But so the so the here's the theory of it is that if you
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.860]   can invest in a private company that say tripling year over year,
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:59.100]   and they can do that for another five years or whatever, then
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:01.060]   you're paying for that you're paying for that outcome in a
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:04.220]   couple years. Basically, well, think about it discount to the
[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:07.060]   outcome in a couple years. Well, if you're paying 30 times today,
[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:09.580]   and it triples next year, you're only paying 10 times next year.
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:12.940]   And if you're only paying three times, so if that keeps going,
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:15.980]   that's where your arbitrage is. But here's the thing you have to
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:19.460]   weigh against that is that these early stage private companies,
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:23.180]   many things go wrong. And they hit a plateau, they fizzle out
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:27.300]   or their growth rate starts to the bigger they get, the harder
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:30.580]   they should be priced at a discount, not a premium, because
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:33.740]   there's risk, there's more risk, they're growing faster, but
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:37.060]   there's more risk. But also, it's very hard once you get to a
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:41.420]   bigger number of ARR 50 100 million of ARR, it's extremely
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.580]   difficult to be doubling or tripling year over year. Let me
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:46.540]   just point one thing out. So I looked at the numbers on Coupa.
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.460]   I think they had about 170 million of stock based comp
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:54.900]   expense in the last nine months. So those are employees that are
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:59.340]   getting $170 million in compensation in the form of
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:01.820]   shares. So they get those shares, they can then sell those
[00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:05.460]   shares and get cash for them on the market, and then on the
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:08.420]   public markets and pay their bills. So when a company like
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:12.500]   this goes private, for those employees to just remain at
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:16.860]   their baseline comp, that stock based comp needs to be replaced
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:19.500]   with something else, or else they're seeing their salaries
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:23.820]   reduced. So, you know, there's this balancing game when these
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:28.020]   companies go private, in terms of how do you give them the comp
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:30.700]   that they're earning to keep them engaged in the business,
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:33.900]   the answer is don't versus no, but you let them you let them
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:36.940]   quit because you want to do a riff anyway. Right. So I mean,
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:40.260]   do you but for the people that stay, right, so there's a
[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:43.460]   balance because it's not just hey, cut the opex, you have to
[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:46.220]   cut the opex, including stock based comp. And this company
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:52.660]   generated about $100 million, sorry, $210 million of free
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:56.660]   cash flow or operating cash flow in the last 12 months. So if you
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:59:00.020]   if you take out the stock based comp, these guys are actually
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:03.780]   break even or losing money roughly. Yeah, so yeah, and
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:06.980]   break even roughly. So there's a real question mark on this
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:09.700]   business and businesses like this that go private, where if
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:12.180]   you actually cut the opex and you cut the salaries and you cut
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:15.700]   the headcount, but you have to find new ways to pay people
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:18.100]   because you've been paying them with stock in the past, how do
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.980]   you kind of bridge that gap? And I think that's probably a little
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:22.460]   bit of the balance and the art of what these guys do well,
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:26.660]   Jamal, if I may, can you explain to the audience what a private
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:30.620]   equity firms expectation is in terms of return when they buy a
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.900]   company like this, and then sacks, I saw your tweet that you
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:34.260]   want to feature and you'll go next.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:38.540]   Well, I think it's changed over time. And this is what's so
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:42.340]   powerful about the private equity industry. Look, you have
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:45.420]   to think about what their incentive is, because it kind of
[00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:49.700]   guides the yes. Early on, they were very much like venture
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:53.580]   capitalists, they were out in the, you know, edges of risk
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:58.660]   taking, doing all kinds of very difficult, gnarly deals. So if
[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:01.300]   you look back in the history of private equity, you know, these
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:05.220]   huge, crazy deals like RGR Nabisco, or TWA Airlines were
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:10.780]   the first of the industry, and they weeped enormous returns,
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:14.060]   but there was a lot of risk, and it required very heavy handed
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.500]   management. Oftentimes, what that meant was firing a lot of
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.820]   people. Over time, private equity has gotten
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:27.140]   institutionalized, and they don't generally feature
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:30.540]   themselves as a place to get the best necessarily returns, but
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:34.220]   they are places where you can put enormous amounts of money,
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:40.220]   where the likelihood of loss is extremely zero, and you generate
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:44.820]   very good rates of return. Now, again, this depends on whether
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:49.460]   you want to look at IRR, or DPI, right? So a lot of people will
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:53.860]   market IRR, which, you know, I think is kind of like a
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:58.980]   gameable metric. But you know, those IRRs can be 20-25%. If you
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:02.220]   look at DPI, which is really how much cash you get back, you
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:05.460]   know, private equity firms can generate one and a half to 2x of
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:08.860]   the money you give them. But they do it consistently, and
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:13.220]   they very rarely lose money. So all of that is important into
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:16.260]   understanding what's going to happen in this cycle. These
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:19.900]   folks are going to buy a ton of these private software
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:25.180]   companies. I think that they are going to fire lots of people. I
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:27.620]   think they are going to make these companies run hyper
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:32.900]   efficiently, and they will make sure that they generate that 1.2
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:36.780]   to 1.7x that has been historical. Very rarely will
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:40.580]   they lose money in these things. By the way, that's going to mean
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:42.580]   that a lot of these other companies will have to reset
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:46.620]   valuation. So you saw yesterday, checkout.com went from a $40
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:51.140]   billion valuation down to 11. You're seeing some companies
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:55.620]   only go down 10 or 15%. But it's a process, isn't it, Shamath?
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.980]   Isn't this just like what happens in real estate where
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.780]   beginning of this process? Yes, because in real estate, my
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.060]   understanding having lived through these boomer cycles is
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:06.100]   the person living in the home still believes their home is
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:08.860]   worth, you know, this incredibly valuation, and then the people
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:12.060]   who want to buy it are like, that doesn't match reality. And
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.820]   then the real estate brokers go back and forth trying to get
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:18.100]   people to, you know, go through this messy middle and come to
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.860]   true price discovery a private company, it's hard to get true
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:23.780]   price discovery until they're on the brink of insolvency. We
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:24.420]   don't have the money.
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:27.340]   We just got some data on that actually, can we bring this
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:33.020]   Cooley data? Yeah, so Cooley looked at a law firm in Silicon
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:35.260]   Valley. Yeah, they're a prominent Silicon Valley law
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:37.900]   firm, they looked at 1000 deals over the last three quarters of
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:42.660]   this year. And what they saw is that you're the later the stage,
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:45.220]   the bigger the valuation correction. So series D rounds
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:48.380]   went from three and a half billion to 527 million. That's
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:53.260]   an one 7% Oh, yeah, that's an 85% drop. Series C went from
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:59.500]   502 million 230 million to 74% drop. Series B went from 164 to
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:04.220]   90. That's a 45% drop. And then series A went from 58 to 45.
[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:07.980]   That's only a 22% drop, there's just less room to compress
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:12.420]   there. But the point is that series B roughly a 50% drop
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:17.180]   series C roughly a three quarters drop, and series D,
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:23.580]   roughly a 85%. Yeah, one seventh drop. So I think founders right
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:26.540]   now are they're just like a little bit delusional about
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:29.620]   this money they raised last year, they're still way too
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:32.780]   anchored on last year's valuation. And if only they
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:36.060]   would think in terms of this capital they raised last year,
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:40.860]   in terms of, of its real dilution in terms of what the
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.780]   company is worth now, I think they'd be treating it more more
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:47.420]   precious. So for example, sex, for example, hold on, if you
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:49.900]   like, they won the lottery, and they don't want to they don't
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.860]   realize they won the lottery. I had this conversation with the
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:54.700]   founder, this is the only money they're ever going to see is the
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.460]   bottom line. And they're spending like they're going to
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:58.980]   win the lottery every year. So for example, let's say you take
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:02.900]   a company, yeah, let's say you take a company that raised 200
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:06.300]   million last year at 2 billion. So it was 10% dilution. So in
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.140]   their heads, they're thinking, Oh, well, this isn't that
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:11.900]   expensive, like 10% dilutions around the era, but really,
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:15.740]   probably the company is worth maybe 400 million now, right?
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:19.860]   Because it's gone down 80%. Yes, 200 million of your 400 million
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:22.140]   is half the value of the company. Yes. And you're
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:24.660]   squandering it, you're squandering it at a rate of 100
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:28.060]   million a year. So you're basically burning up 25% of the
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:30.620]   value of your company this year, and the next year. And then by
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:33.140]   the way, you're going to be in crisis after that, because
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:35.540]   you're probably like a lottery winner buying like a giant
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:36.220]   superyacht.
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:39.380]   I had an observation that a lot of the investors that sit on the
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:45.060]   boards of these companies. They have an incentive to not see
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:48.900]   those valuations come down too quickly, do they not. And so
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:52.820]   there is this sort of like, interest in, hey, I don't want
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.180]   you to have to go reprice the company or do a down round
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:57.900]   because then my portfolio gets written down. And then I'm in
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.780]   the middle, everyone's always in the middle of a fundraising
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:02.060]   cycle with LPS. And then I'm going to have a tough
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:05.860]   conversation with my LP is about my, my value. So do you not see
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:10.620]   VCs and investors playing an active role in trying to keep
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:13.340]   the valuations propped up to some extent, particularly where
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:17.340]   they have big markups 100% by extending bridge rounds or doing
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:19.300]   other sorts of, you know,
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:23.460]   look, nobody, nobody likes to go through a down round. And that
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:26.340]   includes founders and existing investors in the company. That
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:29.420]   being said, we're not talking here about new financing
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:33.420]   conversations we're talking about is advice that is
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:36.940]   happening in board meetings. And, you know, maybe other VCs
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:39.500]   aren't pushing as hard as we are. But you the advice I'm
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.740]   giving in board meetings is what I'm telling you publicly today,
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.780]   which is, this is the last money you may be able to raise on
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:48.900]   attractive terms, if at all, you need to treat it much more
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:51.780]   preciously, the world has fundamentally changed. And by
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.940]   the way, we haven't even gotten into what's coming the demand
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:57.700]   contraction that's coming next year.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.140]   Explain what demand contract contraction is for the audience,
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:00.620]   please. Thank you.
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:04.260]   Okay, look, there's going to be three major sources of slowdown
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:08.020]   for software companies next year. Number one, new business
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:11.420]   is going to dry up companies are just going to be spending a lot
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:14.500]   less money next year, because they're all cutting costs. So
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:18.060]   you should expect your new business to be roughly 50% of
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:22.020]   what it was. Next year, it'll be 50% of what it was last year.
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:24.900]   That's my rule of thumb. For most companies, new business
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:28.260]   down 50%. Number two churn is going to be higher. We haven't
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:31.620]   seen that much logo churn yet. But next year, a lot of
[01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:34.260]   companies are going to start going out of business. And it's
[01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:36.580]   going to happen over the next two years. So you're simply
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:40.220]   going to see logo churn rates, say among small businesses go
[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:44.780]   from like a historical norm of 15% to maybe 25 or 30.
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:47.980]   It's not the words your customer, the logo
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:51.380]   customer simply doesn't exist. Yes, that's what I'm going to go
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:54.820]   means. Yes, the actual entity. Yes, logo churn means the
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:58.300]   entity doesn't exist, then you've got seat contraction,
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:01.900]   which is these companies are not hiring as fast. In fact, they're
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:05.260]   doing layoffs. So they're simply not going to buy as many seats
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:07.940]   of your software as you need to in the past. For the last
[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:11.100]   decade, we've had a tailwind, an enormous tailwind for software
[01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:14.180]   companies of seed expansion, which is every year your
[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:17.060]   existing customers would buy more seats of your product for
[01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:20.180]   their new employees. Now they're actually going to have fewer
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:22.820]   employees or maybe headcount freezes. So they're actually
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.180]   buying fewer seats.
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:27.500]   By the way, if you if you take all those three things, the deal
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:32.460]   of the century was figma selling to Adobe for 20. Because if you
[01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:37.020]   take those three things, I mean, oh my god, they just absolutely
[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:41.020]   top tick before any of this stuff was no. So today, Adobe
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:45.580]   could probably buy this thing for like 7 billion, 20 billion.
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:48.300]   So does that mean they try to do a breakup thing get out of the
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:52.340]   deal? I don't know. But if I was if I was figma, I try to close
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:55.100]   this thing ASAP and get that money. Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:57.780]   Yeah, you're right about that. And by the way, what I'm seeing
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:02.940]   from founders is that they still want to grow 100% plus over the
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:06.060]   next year. The problem is that the headwinds are going to be
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:10.180]   intense. So if you're flying a plane, and the headwinds are
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:13.020]   extremely intense, and you try to maintain your speed, you're
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.140]   going to burn an enormous amount of fuel, you're going to be
[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:18.900]   incredibly inefficient. It's better to basically just
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:22.980]   moderate your speed. Let the headwinds basically pass, we're
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:25.540]   gonna have major economic headwinds for the next four to
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:29.460]   six quarters, call it year and a half. It's okay to have a slower
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:32.820]   growth rate, preserve your cash, don't burn up your fuel bunker
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:36.220]   down. So what we're trying to do is we're trying to give
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:39.620]   permission to our founders to grow at a slower rate because
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:43.700]   they feel this enormous pressure from their VCs to grow at at at
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:46.260]   insane rates. Can I build on this? I think freeberg said it
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:49.460]   very well, the scan in venture capital is demonstrated in the
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.820]   following chart. This is using Cambridge and our friend Brad
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:55.980]   Gerstner helped put this together. So what is this? This
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:09:02.740]   goes back all the way to 1997. And the gray bar is what venture
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:08.340]   capitalists share with their limited partners as to how well
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:11.340]   they are doing what is called quartile of venture capital. And
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:14.620]   this is the top 25%. Okay, so this is this is a venture
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:17.820]   capitalist. And you know, our returns have been consistently
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:20.540]   top quartile. So instead of cherry picking anybody else,
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:23.860]   I'll just use us but it could be Sequoia, benchmark, you name it,
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:26.520]   we will go back we're in their launch, you will go back to
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.580]   folks craft, we'll go back to folks and say, Hey, guys, the
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:34.140]   total value of our portfolio is three times your money in 1997
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:39.300]   is vintage. Okay, it was four times your money in the 2010
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:42.780]   vintage feels really good. But again, the job of the venture
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:49.940]   capitalist is to convert the gray bar into the purple bar.
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:55.260]   And historically, there's been a decay. So for every dollar of
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:58.260]   gray bar that you show, you typically only get 73 cents
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.340]   actually returned to people. Okay.
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:06.300]   The valuations that you get when you sell your company or goes
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:10.740]   public, end up being 73% of what you marked at the peak what you
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:11.740]   said they were exactly right.
[01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:17.300]   Exactly right. And the actual value of this purple bar going
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:23.340]   back, you know, 30 years is 1.7 x. So just to put numerical
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:26.740]   numbers on this, if you were a venture capitalist, you would
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:32.220]   raise $100 fund at the peak, you would actually show that that
[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:38.540]   $100 became 200 and about $28. But when when push came to shove,
[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:42.260]   and when it was all said and done, you would return $170
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:46.340]   back to your investors. That's the rough equation. So what's
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:49.860]   the problem? Well, the problem as you can see in this chart is
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:55.780]   right around 2015 which is all of a sudden, you know, what we've
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:11:01.140]   started to see are these continually elevated gray bars.
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:06.780]   Yes, this stuff is worth seven times six times five times. But
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:10.380]   we have not seen the purple bars catch up. Now some people will
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.060]   say, Well, yeah, but you have to give it time. And, you know,
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:16.820]   this is it has to make other reasons look at. And all you
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:20.420]   need to do is do what's called a regression. And you need to
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:23.100]   regress these things to the mean and make the following
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:27.620]   assumption. Assume for a second that this time is not different.
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:33.860]   Assume that these historical averages 2.2 x 1.7 x holds.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:37.820]   Well, that's what the the black line here shows you can
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:42.940]   calculate the area above the curve as the value at risk,
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:46.460]   right, the amount of money we will destroy, because of all
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:49.340]   these shenanigans that free bird just talked about propping up
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:52.940]   marks, not willing to look at actual market clearing prices.
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:57.500]   Well, if you do the math, the sum of the area above this black
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:01.180]   line is almost a trillion dollars around the world. And it
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:07.020]   is about $600 billion for us venture capitalists. This is the
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:10.340]   dynamic that the private equity industry is going to prey on. So
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:13.660]   if you saw Toma Bravo just closed a $32 billion round, you
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:17.180]   know, Vista is raising a $20 billion round, everybody's
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:20.540]   stepping into tech, they are going to destroy those gray bars.
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:24.500]   You describe that as bottom feeding? No, no, they are. They
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:27.580]   are the rational actor. Yeah. Okay. Who is finding the true
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:32.660]   market? I think the private equity industry is unbelievably
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:37.340]   precise, and talented in being dispassionate and telling us
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.660]   what these things are cut through.
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.380]   They're logical. No, no, it's not.
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:43.540]   They're just not shooting for the private equity industry is
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:46.900]   going to be created by profligate founders. And look,
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:50.260]   you could blame VCs for the high marks last year as well. They
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:54.100]   were profligate too. But look, if you're a founder, if you
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:56.820]   don't start acting in a more capital efficient way and
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:59.820]   preserve your cash, your company is ultimately gonna be owned by
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:01.580]   a private equity firm, and they're gonna make all the
[01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:04.900]   money. Well, here's because because because when you sell to
[01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:07.740]   them at a low price, all you're gonna end up doing is paying
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:11.140]   back the liquidation preference. And then that private equity
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:14.580]   firm that was willing to do or less, but that private equity
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:17.140]   firm will be willing to do what you were not willing to do,
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:21.180]   which was simply act, but cut your burn, cut your costs and
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:23.660]   act in a more capital efficient way. And they will end up making
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:27.380]   all the upside for your decade of hard work. Because you got a
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:30.780]   basically addicted to venture capital and the high valuations
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:34.220]   and refuse to, again, adjust to the regime.
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:37.060]   I'll give you an alternative, I'll give you an alternative.
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:40.300]   The alternative is that the majority of acquisitions made by
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:43.420]   private equity firms are not actually pure acquisitions,
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:46.300]   they're bolt on acquisitions, meaning that these are companies
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:49.260]   that are added to existing platforms that they own. So this
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:52.100]   acquisition they're doing of Coupa, I think it's very likely
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:54.660]   over the next couple of years, you will see like the playbook
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:58.220]   and private equity includes not just cost cutting, but also
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:01.340]   synergy building. And they typically do bolt ons and add
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:04.580]   ons. And this happens across all private equity platform deals of
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:07.340]   new products and services that can be sold through the existing
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:11.180]   sales channel, the existing customer base, and as an add on
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.300]   to the existing service or product that's already offered.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:16.460]   So one of the feet, one of the things that I think you may see
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:19.020]   in Silicon Valley, over the next couple of years is a
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:22.740]   rationalization away from funding feature companies, and
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:25.220]   thinking much more carefully about what can be true standalone
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:27.420]   product companies. Sure. And many of these companies that
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:31.500]   have raised a ton of capital, and have gotten crazy valuations,
[01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.460]   at the end of the day, they're more likely better equipped to
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:37.780]   be a feature of another platform than they are to be a standalone
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.420]   platform company of their own. And that's where the majority of
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:44.060]   these acquisitions will likely end up going. Yeah, in the
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:46.980]   private equity landscape, and they will be vacuumed up and
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:49.540]   attached to existing platforms that these private equity guys
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:52.140]   are building out. And by the way, just look as an example of
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:54.660]   what Oracle did over the years, what Salesforce did over the
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.460]   years, what Google did so many of these companies bolt on
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:00.100]   acquisitions by bolt on acquisitions by building a
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:03.780]   channel, building a platform, and then adding on top of that.
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:05.540]   And I think that a lot of these guys are going to try and
[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:08.300]   mimic two critical points. Number one, what about the
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:12.180]   bottom 75% of VCs? Oh, if you show that chart, just for one
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:15.700]   more second. I just want to remind everybody, that is the
[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:20.220]   absolute cream of the crop VCs. The best. These are folks. I
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:23.140]   mean, again, I'll just say us Sequoia benchmark, we've
[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:25.860]   consistently been crap. Thank you launch craft. These are
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:28.660]   these are top chefs. Return Street. Thank the Lord. What
[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:31.260]   about the bottom 75%? Not gonna be able to raise funds, man.
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.860]   It's over a lot of these people who raise first time funds in
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:36.220]   the last three or four years. So it's also the company's
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:41.180]   own. Because like, like, it's like the today is the now is the
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:45.060]   moment for the sober founder and the sober venture capitalist to
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:48.500]   sit and say, what is the real valuation? What do we need to
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.380]   do to make sure that this company has a chance because
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:54.220]   what SAC said is so true. Otherwise, all these profit
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:56.660]   dollars will be made by the private equity.
[01:15:56.660 --> 01:16:00.100]   In order to win today, you're going to have to grind, you're
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:03.180]   going to have to work 5060 hours a week, you're going to have to
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:06.780]   be absolutely embrace the age of austerity. And you're gonna have
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:10.140]   to focus on your customer, your product and your bottom line.
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:14.500]   The age of excess is over. If you're not working 5060 70 hours
[01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:17.500]   a week, you're not going to cut it in Silicon Valley. Also key
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:21.300]   second point, profligate, extravagant or wasteful in the
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:24.020]   use of resources just so we get the word of the day from David
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:26.980]   Sachs. That's David Sachs is word of the day after a very
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:30.740]   powerful bull. This is this is that one crazy. You see the
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:37.020]   trauma boy for winter, we will, we will went viral. This is I
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:40.900]   think, Elon's biggest, non obvious impact in this moment,
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:43.860]   JTOW, here's your one answer to your question about what
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:48.860]   happens to the the the bottom 75% of venture firms, it's
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:52.380]   equivalent to what happens with the, you know, kind of, this is
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:55.060]   the bottom of the top, the slide that I just shared, it's the one
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.740]   we looked at a few weeks ago. And I keep referring to it
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:01.660]   because it's just such a staggering like demonstration of
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:04.660]   what people call the power law, which is how you know, kind of
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:08.340]   excess returns accumulate to minority of investments. So just
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:12.500]   a few investments make up the bulk of value that the you know,
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:18.700]   market cap of 43% of companies that have gone public since
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:25.380]   2020 is $750 billion. The market cap of three, the other 300 is
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:30.500]   only $26 billion. And the cash that went in to the $750 billion
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:36.380]   is 136. And the cash that went into the 26 is 107. And so the
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:40.460]   cash that went in to generate that 26 billion 107, that's your
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:46.460]   bottom 50%. And the top 50% put in 136 to make 750. And I think
[01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:48.780]   it gets even narrower as you move further up to that top
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:52.420]   quartile. So you know, it's just I can tell you what LPS are
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:54.220]   saying, because I'm hard business.
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:57.900]   This is the companies that went public. So this is also of the
[01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:01.140]   top company of the top funds and the top companies that were
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:04.980]   actually able to IPO. And so it highlights how much of a power
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:07.740]   law actually plays through. And so the majority of these
[01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:10.940]   companies as in Chamath, even in your chart, you show the top
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:15.740]   quartile, the bottom 75%, or the bottom 50%. I've looked at this
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:19.420]   data as well, of those various vintages are below 1.0, they
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:23.500]   lose money for their LPS. Oh, consistently. And it's a cycle.
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.300]   And so what ends up happening is the next generation comes
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:29.140]   through, and LPS, they make a portfolio of bets. And they hope
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:32.180]   that they make enough bets in the right VCs that their
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:34.940]   portfolio generates greater than you know, market returns greater
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:39.300]   than call it 15 20% target 15% target. But they're going to
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:43.500]   expect that you're not I have an LP report. I'm out there raising
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:46.060]   launch fund for right now. And I moved from like the accredited
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:48.100]   the individual investors say that Oh, yeah, because you're
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:51.820]   yeah, I'm on 506. Yeah, so I'm publicly raising it. And I've
[01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:55.620]   moved on from individual investors $45 million in commits
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:59.500]   after five webinars. Amazing. Now I'm talking to no, it was
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:02.100]   amazing. It's just 506. He is going to change the entire
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:06.180]   industry letting the you know, the masses have some access to
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:09.260]   this capital. And this opportunity accredited and QB is
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:10.540]   going to change the world, I believe.
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:13.860]   Do you have to do deal with everyone? One of them is easy to
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:14.500]   administer.
[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:17.700]   It's incredibly complex, because you have a large number of
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:20.180]   people and they all want to talk to me. So I did webinars, five
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:23.700]   webinars, and it resulted in 100 commits, hundreds of commits
[01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:24.380]   for $45 million.
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:27.980]   You'll be able to get all those capital commitments drawn down
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:30.540]   when you need to, like you have to go ping a couple 100 people
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:31.580]   and get them all wire money to you.
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:35.260]   We need to have more operations people and we only do for we
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:38.340]   let them one thing. One thing you may want to do is like for
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:41.940]   these smaller slugs is you can pre wire you can set up an escrow
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:44.660]   account where you pre wire 100% of the capital. Yes. And then
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:46.900]   you also don't have to you take it down when you're going to
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:49.380]   deploy it. So you keep your IRR correct. So we're actually
[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:51.860]   looking into those solutions. I'll talk to you offline. But I
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:54.620]   just did my first two meetings with endowments, etc, fund to
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:59.700]   funds. The entire discussions right now are around what is
[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:03.820]   your secondary strategy? How are you getting in earlier, not
[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:08.300]   later? And how are you building a larger position? It is an even
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.700]   like some of the QP is where sophisticated in our you know,
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:14.540]   are in over 10 venture funds, the entire discussion governance
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:17.940]   of these companies. Are you taking board seats or not? How
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:20.420]   early are you getting in and building a larger position over
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:24.500]   10%? And what is your secondary strategy? When are you going to
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:27.580]   start taking some chips off the table? So the and I got to say,
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:31.700]   if you're an LP, who didn't sell into the upmarket at all, and
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:34.060]   you're on your first fund, you know, and you had all these
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:36.340]   great marks, and they're getting the coming crashing down,
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:38.980]   they're not going to deal with you. They just have too many
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:39.340]   options.
[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:42.300]   I don't think I don't think they've they've started to come
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:45.740]   down yet. I don't think we know what the top quartiles really
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:48.220]   going to look like over these last few years. I think that's
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:50.820]   going to take four or five years to really sort out. Of course.
[01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:52.380]   Yeah. So I think
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.620]   explain why Chamath just so people understand. Yeah, I
[01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:54.860]   understand.
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:59.900]   Well, I think I think that there are lots of valuations that have
[01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:06.900]   supported huge TV PIs. These, you know, paper gains that have
[01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:11.020]   allowed venture funds to raise enormous amounts of incremental
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:16.500]   capital and new funds. And so they are going to try to wait as
[01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:19.740]   long as possible before they're held accountable for that. And
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:23.300]   the best way to do that is to not change the valuation. And so
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:28.620]   it will happen slowly, it'll be a trickle of these things. And I
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:31.580]   think that takes probably four or five years for it to really
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:34.660]   sort itself out. But in the meantime, companies will still
[01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:37.460]   need to get financed, companies will still need to get built.
[01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:41.060]   That's why I think like the public markets, I think what
[01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:44.980]   SAC says is true. Giving us a signal of what these true market
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:48.380]   clearing prices are, will eventually slip into these, you
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:51.500]   know, series D or E companies, because a venture capitalist who
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:55.060]   has now taken some big write downs in one part of their
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:58.660]   portfolio, I suspect will now be very open to selling to private
[01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:01.180]   equity for another part of their portfolio so that they can
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:01.820]   return capital.
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:05.500]   Totally. Totally agree. Yeah, it's gonna be rough out there.
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.100]   You guys watch White Lotus.
[01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:12.180]   Yeah, I just started season one. I'm third episode in. Okay,
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:14.660]   what a treat. We won't say anything. But how great was
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:15.620]   season two?
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:18.980]   Oh, the rap was awesome. It's just incredible.
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:21.180]   The last two episodes were extraordinary.
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:26.180]   Just finished watching all of Handmaid's Tale, which I will
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:31.020]   tell you is, that is a fucking stressful show. It's like, it's
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:33.500]   like you're putting in work when you're done those episodes.
[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:36.420]   You're like, oh, emotional labor. You know, when they said
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:39.740]   this emotional labor, watching that show is like, it could
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:43.220]   could, it could not be more sadistic and insane. Oh, my God,
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:47.460]   it is brutal. But you can't look away. Incredibly well done.
[01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:52.740]   Alright, listen, this has been an amazing episode. And this is
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:56.140]   news for the other besties. Friedberg and I have been
[01:22:56.140 --> 01:23:01.780]   secretly collaborating. Now we have to a plan that we're
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:05.620]   working on a joint plan for all in summit 2023. Because we are
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:06.980]   both helping each other out.
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:09.540]   I'm ready to tip guys.
[01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:14.900]   I love it. The tip. I know. That's it. We don't need to
[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:17.980]   sacks. I'm a permanent No. That's all that's fine. We know
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:18.220]   that.
[01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:21.740]   I love that I have sacks as my anchor on this one. I can always
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:22.700]   float back that way.
[01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:25.020]   But Friedberg and I
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:25.700]   I'm like,
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:28.460]   the root of all evil.
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:33.220]   Totally in this case, but power and influence is something that
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:37.380]   you that's free bird celebrity. Friedberg had so much of a good
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:42.780]   time at all in summit 2022. That his hatred of my producer fee is
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:46.980]   less than his joy from the event. And we are collaborating
[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:52.140]   on super super gut. I have made up for my producer's fee by
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:55.780]   using super gut and becoming a big proponent.
[01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:57.620]   Announcing the debate. I've used the promo code.
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:01.700]   Paid you for that. That's the quip. Oh, yes. Yes. You know,
[01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:04.820]   this is no conflict. No interest to go along with doing the no
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:08.340]   conflict. No interest. That's what's going on. bars. Amazing.
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:10.220]   So I use the double mocha.
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:13.260]   The only the only person that you haven't taken money from is
[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:15.740]   SPF. I mean, pretty much you're
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:21.340]   by the way, can I point out on the most loathsome person in
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:23.420]   tech? Bracket?
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:24.460]   We go through it.
[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:27.900]   Do not name the company. Do not name the podcast.
[01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:29.780]   I'm eliminated already in the first round.
[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:30.140]   This is
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:34.660]   and you win. No, I thought you won. No, he lost. He was
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:38.060]   the bracket. Do not mention the podcast.
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:43.780]   Jesse get on your chest. Not I only want the bracket. Do not
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:46.780]   mention the podcast. We're not giving them any. Just black out
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:50.900]   that in post. I want you to black out easy. I don't want to
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:53.820]   give these guys any credit. So here we go. The worst person in
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:54.300]   tech.
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:25:00.180]   Martha and sax we would say it's a B podcast. That's run by
[01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:03.180]   literal socialist. Well, look, Chamath got a very tough draw.
[01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:04.940]   I mean, of course, I was to SPF.
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:07.260]   That's ridiculous.
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:08.980]   Of the
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:11.700]   group went up against the Warriors with KD. It is no way
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:12.580]   to win tough. That's a
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:14.180]   no shot. You guys should have
[01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:20.700]   what about sex? Easy draw sacks versus in the most hated person
[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:21.940]   in 10 by 1%
[01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:24.300]   that's bullshit. Andy Jassy is I don't
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:27.900]   Andy Jassy is a complete gentleman. Andy Jassy is
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:30.140]   delightful. I gotta be honest with you.
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:31.860]   Human compared to
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:34.220]   him. Just in spice.
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:38.340]   That is I want to recount. No, I wanted to win. Saks. I want to
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:41.140]   recap. This is election interference. Union busting.
[01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:43.660]   This is election interference. I get something you're a
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:48.380]   specialist in, I guess is worse to be a union busting Amazon CEO
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:50.380]   than a reactionary conservative investor.
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:56.620]   This is ridiculous. I just want to point out that the biggest
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:26:01.620]   travesty here is that I did not make the list. There are and you
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:03.340]   know what these guys are trolling me.
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:07.300]   Guys, shout out to producer Nick who just retreated.
[01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:12.820]   With basically you basically pick the what is it the 30 most
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:15.300]   relatively well known people in tech. That's what tilts Jake
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:17.700]   Caldwell. This is terrible. Worst person in tech. I don't
[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:19.740]   make the list. I'm going to double down
[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:22.700]   this year constantly kowtowing to the media. You're you're
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:25.420]   right. You're right. I need to be horrible.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:29.420]   Stop with that. I need to be a worse human like you Saks. I'm
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:32.820]   going to try my best this year to work against humanity and
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:35.940]   society and be more loathsome than you. I'm really going to
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:39.060]   redouble my efforts. Obviously, I can't catch up with you buy
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:42.220]   into all their phony. I'm too kind. I got a big heart. I care.
[01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:45.100]   I have empathy into all their phony. I know my empathy. But
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:48.740]   here's the problem. These guys left me off on purpose. If you
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:51.340]   want to pull up the replies between Andreessen and Bill
