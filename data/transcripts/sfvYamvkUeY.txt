[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.820]   - A very simple and direct question for you today,
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.540]   Pastor John, over the years,
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.600]   what things have been most apt to steal your joy?
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.280]   - My kids, my marriage,
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.980]   my soul in response to my kids and my marriage.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.080]   If things are sweet at home,
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.800]   you can stand almost anything in the ministry.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.160]   At least that's my experience.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.920]   The hardest battles for me
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.280]   have been emotional battles within my family.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.520]   Living by the spirit,
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.980]   trying to minister by the spirit
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.740]   doesn't prevent hard relational things
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.480]   from happening in the ministry.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.920]   It just gets you through them
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.400]   and gets you through them with hope
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.400]   and in the end with joy in the sustaining grace of God.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.840]   Now, here's some implications of that answer.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.880]   I mean, it's pretty weighty to say
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.880]   the biggest joy stealers in the ministry are not deacons,
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.560]   they're not elders, they're not counseling issues,
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.200]   they're not people who leave the church,
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.400]   they're not notes you get in the mail
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.160]   from a disgruntled parishioner.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.520]   That's just, those problems are nowhere near
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.720]   as emotionally depleting as conflict in the marriage
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.840]   or kids that are disappointing you
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.760]   or you're disappointing them or there's conflict.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.160]   So here's some implications.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.160]   Number one, investment in a happy Christ-honoring marriage
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.340]   is not separate from ministry.
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.780]   For me, it was part of the power of ministry.
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.780]   And I don't just mean that my ministry is legitimated
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.340]   because elders are supposed to have well-behaved homes.
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.100]   That's not what I mean.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.100]   I mean the actual motivation for doing ministry
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.180]   rose and fell with authenticity of the church.
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.420]   Authenticity of Christian living at home.
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.820]   And so it wasn't merely, oh, do I qualify,
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.280]   like some external rule that I had to meet.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.980]   It's rather, can I survive?
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.940]   Is the burden that I feel at home depleting so much energy
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.580]   I won't have anything for Sunday morning?
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.580]   So to invest in the family was to invest in my survival.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.420]   Not just my qualification.
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.420]   Number two, investing in the joy and welfare of the children
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.980]   not just the marriage but in the children
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.340]   was not separate from ministry
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.640]   because it was part of the power.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.640]   A sense of authenticity rose and fell with them as well.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.740]   A hypocrisy is not only a great sin, it's a great weakener.
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.960]   If you feel like you're inauthentic with your kids,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.740]   like you're one thing in the pulpit
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.180]   and your kids see you as another thing,
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.580]   it's gonna be very hard to keep going.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.100]   It's a power depleter.
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.820]   It's an underminer of real spiritual authority
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.500]   in the pulpit and power in people's lives.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.500]   Third, when struggles inevitably come at home
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.660]   and they will come with wife, with children,
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.860]   don't go underground with them.
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.820]   Entrust yourself to the elders and to close friends.
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.500]   Enlist prayer, get the counsel you need.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.300]   This is for the sake of ministry, not just for the family.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.020]   It's all woven together.
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.180]   Fourth, when the storms come, don't quit.
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.820]   Satan wants you to quit.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.580]   He's as active as anybody in this thing
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.900]   and he wants you out of the ministry
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.700]   or at least out of fruitfulness.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.620]   He wants you paralyzed with discouragement.
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.620]   Tell him to go to hell, which is where he belongs,
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.080]   and then bank on the promises of God
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.540]   that he who is greater, he who is in you
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.580]   is greater than he who's in the world.
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.500]   That promise has been very precious over the years
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.580]   as I've gotten in Satan's face about his temptations.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.180]   Fifth, when storms come, and they will,
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.180]   don't manipulate your kids or your wife
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.340]   to tell them, "No, if you don't behave,
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.340]   "you're gonna disqualify me from ministry."
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.860]   That's just an absolutely wrong thing to say
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.060]   because that kind of obedience isn't obedience, right?
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.660]   You don't want kids or your wife
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.340]   thinking about your ministry that way,
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.700]   that you shouldn't ever jerk them around like that
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.060]   or use your role as a kind of lever
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.180]   to try to get their hearts to be right with God.
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.780]   That's just counterproductive.
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.420]   It's not going to work.
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.620]   There are reasons to obey as children
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.720]   and reasons to walk in joyful holiness,
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.040]   and that's not one of them.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.980]   There ought to be other reasons.
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.940]   If a kid is just containing his worldliness
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.080]   to keep Daddy's job, that kid's gonna explode someday
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.840]   and do more damage than if he'd been honest,
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.880]   and so Dad shouldn't encourage that kind of hypocrisy
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.780]   in their kids.
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.780]   And the last thing I would say is
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.500]   cry out to the Lord for help.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.740]   That's what I did over and over again.
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.740]   He won't let you be tested beyond what you are able,
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.980]   but with the testing, you know,
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.900]   we usually translate that temptation
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.800]   and we almost always think of sex.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.180]   The word perosmos means testing as well as temptation.
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.360]   He will not let you be tested beyond what you're able,
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.020]   but with the testing in the family
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.080]   will make a way of escape so that you will be able
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.920]   to bear it.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.920]   I have seen, Tony, I have seen light at the end of tunnels
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.120]   that seemed impossibly dark.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.760]   So that's God's answer to that promise
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.680]   in 1 Corinthians 10, 13.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.760]   He will make an opening at the end of this tunnel.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.400]   Trust me, hold on, don't doubt me in the dark.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.240]   I am a God of light and I will be with you.
