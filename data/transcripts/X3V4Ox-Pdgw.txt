[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.080]   - Hello, this is Pastor John.
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.440]   I get to start this episode by talking
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.440]   about another Pastor John, John Newton.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.260]   Newton was a key leader in England in the 18th century,
[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.680]   as you know, the author of the incredibly popular hymn,
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.220]   "Amazing Grace."
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.120]   Newton was a former captain of a slave trading ship
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.080]   and was dramatically converted from this life of sin
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.880]   and eventually helped William Wilberforce
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.760]   in the British slave trade.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.760]   So I wanted to take a moment to introduce you
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.580]   to a new book about a part of Newton's life
[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.000]   that goes overlooked.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.720]   His 40 plus years in pastoral ministry
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.100]   and the amazing ministry of writing letters
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.900]   to people in need.
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.600]   The book is written by Tony Reinke,
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.740]   the host of this podcast.
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.400]   Tony calls his book "Pastoral Synthesis."
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.080]   He wants you to be pastored by John Newton.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.480]   And so he gathered up all of Newton's many published letters
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.120]   about a thousand of them in various collections,
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.140]   many of them preserved in old, rare, fragile volumes
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.800]   in libraries around the world.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.240]   He found them, studied them,
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.820]   and then identified Newton's key answers
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.360]   to the perennial questions of the Christian life.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.040]   And then Tony wrote all his findings
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.660]   into a guided tour of Newton's thought.
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.840]   It's a kind of "Ask Pastor John Newton."
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.720]   The book releases this week.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.640]   It's titled "Newton on the Christian Life to Live as Christ."
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.000]   I commend it very highly.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.600]   - Levi, a podcast listener in Indiana,
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.320]   writes in, "Pastor John,
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.800]   on whether or not to listen to music
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.000]   that includes themes of sexual immorality,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.880]   materialism, and other forms of worldliness,
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.460]   is this a decision of individual conviction
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.720]   or is this music categorically sinful?"
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.140]   I know many people who say that it is a matter of conscience
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.040]   for individuals to determine for themselves.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.680]   I would love your biblical thoughts on this.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.400]   - The first thing that comes to my mind
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   that needs to be addressed is a cynic,
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.360]   maybe, or I don't know what you'd call them,
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.000]   a Christian who thinks good grief.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.480]   Don't we have bigger fish to fry
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.960]   than talking about what kind of music we listen to?
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.320]   Don't you guys know that people are suffering in the world?
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.160]   And here we are squabbling about music.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.400]   So that person is looking over my shoulder
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.160]   as I contemplate whether even to answer this question.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.000]   And my answer to that person,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.080]   as a means to getting toward an answer to the question,
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.600]   is we always deal with lesser things
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.760]   for the sake of greater things.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.440]   A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.520]   That's why you're concerned about a little leaven.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.720]   - Right, exactly.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.720]   - You don't say, "Oh, little leavens don't matter."
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.720]   Well, Paul says, "They matter because big lumps matter."
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.080]   So yeah, I'm all into big lumps.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.880]   I want my life to count for big things and not little things.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.960]   Little things affect big things,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.200]   especially when kids are growing up.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.320]   Most things feel little at one level.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.000]   What's the root?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.280]   Here's a second question I would ask to this person
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.920]   who just told me, "Don't waste your time on this question."
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.920]   What's the root of Christ dishonoring indifference
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.440]   to the poor and the suffering,
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.120]   temporal suffering, eternal suffering?
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.120]   What's the root of that in adults or kids, wherever?
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.440]   'Cause that's what this person
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.800]   presumes to be concerned about.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.840]   And I wanna know, what's the root of that kind of Christ
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.880]   dishonoring indifference?
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.800]   And the root is Christlessness,
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.720]   the absence of Christ
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.720]   as the supreme treasure of our affections,
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.840]   the absence of His word as a controlling force in our lives.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.880]   That's the source of Christ dishonoring indifference
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.240]   to suffering.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.000]   And where does that kind of non-Christ-treasuring heart
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.440]   come from?
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.200]   Well, it doesn't come from anywhere.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.440]   We're born with it.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.600]   Jesus' out-of-the-heart-come murder, adultery,
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander,
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.480]   all that stuff is selfishness.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.320]   And big acts of selfishness
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.560]   grow in the soil of selfishness.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.880]   So what about music?
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.600]   What about tending the garden of your heart with music?
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.040]   What about the ways we tend the soil of our soul
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.240]   that determine what kinds of things grow in it?
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.120]   There is such a thing as worldly music.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.560]   One of the marks of worldly music
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.560]   is the exaltation in a worldly view of life.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.520]   A worldly view of life is a life that leaves Christ out
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.960]   and approves of what He disapproves.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.080]   That's worldly.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.360]   Worldly isn't a sound.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.240]   Worldly is leaving Christ out.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.920]   That's why it's called worldly and not Christly.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.680]   Worldly, and it approves of what He disapproves.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.600]   It's called worldly because it treasures the world
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.400]   above the one who made the world.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.800]   It revels in the very self-centeredness
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.520]   that gives rise to the miseries of the world.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.880]   And what does God say about this?
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.200]   Here's a few texts.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.320]   Romans 12, "Do not be conformed to this world,
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.720]   "but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.560]   "that you may by testing discern what is the will of God,
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.240]   "what is good and acceptable and perfect."
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.240]   So my question is, is the transformation of our minds
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.240]   helped by soaking them in sin-celebrating world,
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.880]   the world we're trying not to be conformed to?
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.880]   Don't be conformed to the sin-celebrating,
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.480]   Christ-omitting world.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.160]   And I think the answer's patent, garbage in, garbage out.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.160]   If you soak your mind in the Christlessness of the world,
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.900]   you will be less Christ-full.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.980]   Is the music of the world a helpful path
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.980]   to renewing your mind to love what the world does not love?
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.620]   That's the key question.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.220]   Or Matthew 5, 8, "Blessed are the pure in heart,
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.620]   "for they shall see God."
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.780]   Is our pursuit of purity helped
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.760]   by enjoying the way the world enjoys impurity?
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.780]   Or Colossians 3, 1, "If then you have been raised
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.840]   "with Christ, seek the things that are above,
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.440]   "set your mind on things that are above,
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.900]   "not on things that are on the earth."
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.580]   Does the music that exalts in Christless feeling
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.660]   and Christless thinking and Christless acting,
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.660]   does it help us set the mind on Christ?
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.980]   Paul's concern is that we have the mind of Christ,
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.340]   that we love what he loves, we hate what he hates,
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.540]   we enjoy what he enjoys.
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.860]   Does the music we listen to help that happen?
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.180]   Or Colossians 3, 5, and 8, "Put to death, therefore,
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.020]   "what is earthly in you, sexual immorality, impurity,
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.220]   "passion, evil desire, covetousness, which is idolatry.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.340]   "Put them all away, anger, wrath, malice, slander,
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.580]   "obscene talk from your mouth."
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.780]   We are to be actively putting to death
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.220]   in our hearts all things that we be prone to
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.940]   that are sinful.
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.260]   Does feeding these inclinations
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:13.500]   that we are supposed to kill help us kill them?
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.320]   Or should we starve them instead of nourishing them?
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.320]   2 Peter 2, "Many will follow their sensuality,
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.460]   "and because of them the way of truth will be blasphemed."
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.460]   The fact is, many who listen to Christ omitting sensuality
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:37.380]   are made more sensual.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.420]   Our sensitivities to sin are made more dull,
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.820]   and we are at home more and more with the world
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.780]   and not with heaven, not with Christ, not with his way,
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.420]   not with his kingdom, and not with his joy.
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.140]   Proverbs 13, 20, "Whoever walks with the wise
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.920]   "will become wise, but the companion of fools
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.860]   "will suffer harm."
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.260]   1 Corinthians 15, "Do not be deceived.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.580]   "Bad company corrupts good morals."
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.700]   And the issue here is not whether you're free to go
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.220]   among the world and bear witness
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.040]   to the supreme beauty of Christ anywhere in the world,
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.100]   among the world, and among the unbelieving,
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.340]   and among the sensual.
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.880]   The issue is whether we are at home enjoying ourselves
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.660]   with the way the world thinks.
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.980]   Let me say that again.
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.500]   The issue is whether we are at home
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:33.500]   and enjoying ourselves with the way the world thinks.
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:38.780]   I'm listening right now to Richard Wernbrandt's
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.660]   "Tortured for Christ," written 40 years ago.
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.920]   He was imprisoned as a Romanian pastor
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.820]   during the Communist takeover in Romania.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.540]   For 14 years, he was in jail and tortured.
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.540]   And just yesterday, just yesterday, I heard him say,
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.740]   this is a rough quote, I couldn't find it on the tape.
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.700]   I tried to go back and find it, so I'm paraphrasing.
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.620]   Many of those who were willing to deny their faith
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.900]   and accept the Communist rule were put in charge
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.580]   of the state-approved church.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:11.060]   And he said, "They often listen to worldly music."
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.900]   That was his phrase.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.820]   "They often listen to worldly music."
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.180]   And then he said, took me off guard, he said,
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:21.180]   "We too played worldly music, very loud,
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.040]   "so that it would cover our Bible discussions
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.160]   "in the underground church and make the Communists
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.300]   "think that we were like others."
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.280]   So I would just say, if that's your plan,
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.700]   listen to worldly music.
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.020]   - Nice little spin on the topic.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.140]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.380]   And speaking of music, beautiful and edifying music,
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.180]   special thanks to cellist Patricia White

[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.980]   which we are using in this episode.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.440]   And thank you to Pastor John for promoting my new book here
