[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   The following is a conversation with Sean Kelly,
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.800]   a philosopher at Harvard specializing in existentialism
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.120]   and the philosophy of mind.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.360]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.640]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.160]   in the description.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.980]   And now, here's my conversation with Sean Kelly.
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.840]   Your interests are in post-continental European philosophy,
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.440]   especially phenomenology and existentialism.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.800]   So let me ask, what to you is existentialism?
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.000]   - So it's a hard question.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.360]   I'm teaching a course on existentialism right now.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.720]   - You are. - I am, yeah.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.980]   Existentialism in literature and film, which is fun.
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.400]   The traditional thing to say about what existentialism is
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.140]   is that it's a movement in mid-20th century,
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.640]   mostly French, some German philosophy,
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.080]   and some of the major figures associated with it
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.760]   are people like Jean-Paul Sartre and Camus,
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.080]   Simone de Beauvoir, maybe Martin Heidegger.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.440]   But that's a weird thing to say about it
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.240]   because most of those people denied
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.960]   that they were existentialists.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.320]   And in fact, I think of it as a movement
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.700]   that has a much longer history.
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.240]   So when I try to describe what the core idea
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.920]   of existentialism is, it's an idea
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.800]   that you find expressed in different ways
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.260]   in a bunch of these people.
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.400]   One of the ways that it's expressed
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.200]   is that Sartre will say that existentialism
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.080]   is the view that there is no God,
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.720]   and at least his form of existentialism,
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.320]   he calls it atheistic existentialism, there is no God.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.240]   And since there's no God,
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.560]   there must be some other being around
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.520]   who does something like what God does.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.760]   Otherwise, there wouldn't be any possibility
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.000]   for significance in a life.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.040]   And that being is us, and the feature of us,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.680]   according to Sartre and the other existentialists,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.040]   that puts us in the position to be able to play that role
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.240]   is that we're the beings for whom,
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.420]   as Sartre says it, "Existence precedes essence."
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.240]   That's the catchphrase for existentialism,
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.320]   and then you have to try to figure out what it means.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.080]   - What does existence, what does presence,
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.320]   and what does precedes mean?
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.200]   - Yeah, exactly, what is existence,
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.440]   what is essence, and what is precedes?
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.640]   And in fact, precedes is Sartre's way of talking about it,
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.400]   and other people will talk about it differently.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.240]   But here's the way Sartre thinks about it.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.080]   This is not, I think, the most interesting way
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.240]   to think about it, but it gets you started.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.480]   Sartre says, "There's nothing true
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.360]   "about what it is to be you
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.480]   "until you start existing, until you start living."
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.040]   And for Sartre, the core feature
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.960]   of what it is to be existing the way we do
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.680]   is to be making decisions, to be making choices in your life,
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.160]   to be sort of taking a stand on what it is to be you
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.320]   by deciding to do this or that.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.320]   And the key feature of how to do that right for Sartre
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.360]   is to do it in the full recognition of the fact
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.480]   that when you make that choice,
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.560]   nobody is responsible for it other than you.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.760]   So you don't make the choice because God tells you to,
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.160]   you don't make the choice because some utilitarian calculus
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.060]   about what it's right to do tells you to do,
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.080]   you don't make the choice
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.820]   because some other philosophical theory tells you to do it.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.040]   There's literally nothing on the basis
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.920]   of which you make the choice
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.160]   other than the fact that in that moment,
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.200]   you are the one making it.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.360]   - You are a conscious thinking being that made a decision.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.040]   So all of the questions about physics and free will
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.600]   are out the window.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.580]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.520]   If you were a determinist about the mind,
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.360]   if you were a physicalist about the mind,
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.280]   if you thought there was nothing to your choices
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.600]   other than the activity of the brain
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.800]   that's governed by physical laws,
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.060]   then there's some sense in which it would seem at any rate
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.000]   like you're not the ground of that choice.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.960]   The ground of that choice was the physical universe
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.600]   and the laws that govern it.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.400]   And then you'd have no responsibility.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.120]   And so Sartre's view is that the thing that's special
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.200]   about us used to be special about God
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.640]   is that we're responsible for becoming the being
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.720]   that makes the choices that we do.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.000]   And Sartre thinks that that simultaneously empowering,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.320]   I mean, it practically puts us in the place of God
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.300]   and also terrifying because what responsibility?
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.100]   How can you possibly take on that responsibility?
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.500]   And he thinks it's worse than that.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.100]   He thinks that it's always happening.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.940]   Everything that you do is the result of some choice
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.840]   that you've made, the posture that you sit in,
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.820]   the way you hold someone's gaze
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.900]   when you're having a conversation with them or not,
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.720]   the choice to make a note when someone says something
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.320]   or not make a note.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.920]   Everything that you do presents you as a being
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.560]   who makes decisions and you're responsible for all of them.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.920]   So it's constantly happening.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.000]   And furthermore, there's no fact about you
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.880]   independent of the choices and actions you've performed.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.560]   So you don't get to say, Sartre's example,
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.400]   I really am a great writer,
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.200]   just haven't written my great book yet.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.220]   If you haven't written your great book,
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.820]   you're not a great writer.
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.800]   And so it's terrifying.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.940]   It puts a huge burden on us.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.940]   And that's why Sartre says on his view of existentialism,
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.340]   human beings are the beings that are condemned to be free.
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.740]   Our freedom consists in our ability and our responsibility
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.120]   to make these choices and to become someone
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.460]   through making them.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.660]   And we can't get away from that.
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.980]   - But to him it's terrifying not liberating
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.720]   in the positive meaning of the word liberating.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.500]   - Well, so he thinks it should be liberating,
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.220]   but he thinks that it takes a very courageous individual
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.820]   to be liberated by it.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.860]   Nietzsche, I think, thought something similar.
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.160]   I think Sartre's really coming out
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.780]   of a Nietzschean sort of tradition.
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.620]   But what's liberating about it, if it is,
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.260]   is also terrifying because it means in a certain way,
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.340]   you're the ground of your own being.
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.660]   You become what you do through existing.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.460]   So that's one form of existentialism.
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.500]   That's a stark atheistic version of it.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.280]   There's lots of other versions,
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.720]   but it's somehow organized around the idea
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.620]   that it's through living your life
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.020]   that you become who you are.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.140]   It's not facts that are sort of true about you,
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.700]   independent of you're living your life.
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.600]   - But then there's no God in that view.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.040]   Does any of the decisions matter?
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.200]   So how does existentialism differ from nihilism?
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.080]   - Good, okay, great question.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.760]   There was two different ways that you're asking it.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.400]   Let me leave nihilism to the side for just a second
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.320]   and think about mattering.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.560]   Or is there any way that you can criticize someone
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.560]   for living the way they do if you're an existentialist?
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.640]   - Including yourself.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.160]   - Including yourself, yeah.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.920]   Sartre addresses that and he says, yes.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.680]   He says there is a criticism
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.480]   that you can make of yourself or of others.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.720]   And it's the criticism of living in such a way
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.200]   as to fail to take responsibility for your choices.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.660]   He gives these two sort of amazing examples.
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.080]   One, I don't know if it reads as well for us
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.040]   as it did in sort of mid 20th century Paris,
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.200]   but it's about a waiter.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   He gives this in his big book, "Being in Nothingness."
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.320]   And he says, so waiters played, still do I think
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.680]   in a certain way in Paris, a big role in Parisian society.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.320]   To be a waiter involved having a certain kind of identity,
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.320]   being a certain way, taking control of and charge of
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.200]   the experience of the people that you're waiting on,
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.320]   but also really being the authority,
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.680]   knowing that this is the way it's supposed to go.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.440]   And so Sartre imagines a waiter who does everything
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.920]   that a waiter is supposed to do.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.920]   The perfect form of the waiter,
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.840]   except that you can somehow see in the way he's doing it,
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.600]   that he's doing it because he believes
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.160]   that's the way a waiter should act.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.320]   So there's some sense in which he's passing off
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.320]   the responsibility for his actions
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.040]   onto some idea of what those actions should be.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.080]   He's not taking responsibility for it.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.520]   He's sort of playing a role and the contours of the role
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.760]   are predetermined by someone other than him.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.520]   So he starts as acting in bad faith.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.200]   And that's criticizable because it's acting in such a way
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.640]   as to fail to take responsibility
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.360]   for the kind of being Sartre thinks you are.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.560]   So you're not taking responsibility.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.920]   So that's one example.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.840]   And I think any teenager, if you've ever met a teenager,
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.000]   you've known someone who does that.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.920]   Teenagers try on roles.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.200]   They think, if I dressed like this, I would be cool.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.680]   So I'll dress like this.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.240]   Or if I spoke like this or acted like this.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.400]   And it's natural for a teenager who's trying to figure out
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.680]   what their identity is to go through a phase like that.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.400]   But if you continue to do that,
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.800]   then you're really passing it.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.040]   So that's one example.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.040]   And the other example he gives is an example
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.880]   not of passing off responsibility
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   by pretending that someone else is the ground of your choice,
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.880]   but passing off responsibility by pretending
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.120]   that you might be able to get away
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.720]   with not making a choice at all.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.920]   So he says, everything you do is a result of your choices.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.600]   And so he gives this other example.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   There you are on the first date, first date.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.920]   And the date, the evening reaches a moment
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.920]   when might be appropriate for one person
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.760]   to hold the hand of the other.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.720]   That's the moment in the date where you are.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.960]   And so you make a choice.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.120]   You decide, I think it's that time.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.120]   And you hold the hand.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.680]   And what should happen is that the other person
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.960]   also makes a choice on SART's view.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.320]   Either they reject the hand, not that time.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.840]   And I'm taking responsibility for that.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.680]   Or they grasp the hand back.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.680]   That's a choice.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.280]   But there's a thing that sometimes happens,
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.480]   which is that the other person leaves the hand there,
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.800]   cold, dead, and clammy,
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.000]   neither rejecting it nor embracing it.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.600]   And SART says, that's also bad faith.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.480]   That's also acting as if we're a kind of being
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.120]   that we're not, 'cause it pretends
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.680]   that it's possible not to make a choice.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.560]   And we're the beings who are always making choices.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.120]   That was a choice.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.840]   And you're pretending as if it's the kind of thing
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.040]   that you don't have to take responsibility for.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.480]   - So both of the examples you've given,
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.120]   there's some sense in which the social interactions
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.640]   between humans is a kind of moving away
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.440]   from the full responsibility that you as a human
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.600]   in the view of existentialism should take on.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.720]   So isn't the basic conversation,
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.240]   a delegation of responsibility,
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.400]   just holding a hand there.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.680]   You're putting some of the responsibility
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.040]   into the court of the other person.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.240]   And for the waiter, if you exist in a society,
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.480]   you are generally trying on a role.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.000]   I mean, all of us are trying on a role.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.760]   Me wearing clothes is me trying on a role
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.400]   that I was told to try,
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.760]   as opposed to walking around naked all the time.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.200]   Like there's like standards of how you operate.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   And that's a decision that's not my own.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.240]   That's me seeing what everyone else is doing
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.680]   and copying them.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.840]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.840]   So Sartre thinks that in the ideal,
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.280]   you should try to resist that.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.280]   Other existentialists think that that's actually a clue
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.760]   to how you should live well.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.120]   So Sartre says somewhere else, hell is other people.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.800]   Why is hell other people for Sartre?
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.200]   Well, 'cause other people are making choices also.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.000]   And when other people make choices,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.320]   they put some pressure on me
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.040]   to think that the choice they made
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.840]   is one that I should copy
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.080]   or one that I should sort of promote.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.040]   But if I do it because they did it,
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.640]   then I'm in bad faith for Sartre.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.800]   So it is as if Sartre's view is like,
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.360]   we would be better if we were all alone.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.040]   I mean, this is really simplifying Sartre's position.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.040]   And this is really just mostly Sartre
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.640]   in a certain period of his formation.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.600]   But anyhow, we can imagine that view.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.320]   And I think there's something to the idea
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.480]   that Sartre is attracted to it,
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.400]   at least in the mid 40s.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.600]   - Can you dig into hell is other people?
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.320]   Is there some,
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.040]   obviously it's kind of almost like a literary,
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.560]   like you push the point strongly
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.520]   to really explore that point.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.440]   But is there some sense in that other people
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.400]   ruin the experience of what it means to be human?
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.440]   - I think for Sartre, the phenomenon is this.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.460]   Like, it's not just that you wear clothes
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.240]   because people wear clothes in our society.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.200]   Like you have a particular style.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.240]   You wear a particular kind of clothes.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   And for Sartre, like to have that style
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.320]   authentically in good faith, rather than in bad faith,
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.760]   it has to come from you.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.840]   You have to make the choice.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.960]   But other people are making choices also.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.720]   And like, you're looking at their choices
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.980]   and you're thinking that guy looks good.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.960]   Maybe I could try that one on.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.060]   And if you try it on because you were influenced
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.480]   by the fact that you thought that guy was doing it well,
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.160]   then there's some important sense in which,
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.320]   although that's a resource for a choice for you,
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.800]   it's also acting in bad faith.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.900]   So, and God wouldn't do that, right?
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.600]   God wouldn't be influenced by other's decisions.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.160]   And if that's the model, then I think that's the sense
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.440]   in which he thinks how those other people.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.920]   - What do you think parenting is then?
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.640]   It's like, what, 'cause God doesn't have a parent.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.320]   So aren't we significantly influenced,
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.880]   first of all, in the first few years of life?
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.720]   - Absolutely.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.280]   - And even the teenager is resisting,
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.480]   learning through resistance.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.280]   So. - Absolutely.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.280]   I mean, I think what you're pushing on is the intuition
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.000]   that the ideal that Sartre's aiming at
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.600]   is a kind of inhuman ideal.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.640]   I mean, there's many ways in which we're not like
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.620]   the traditional view of what God was.
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.760]   One is that we're not self-generating.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.800]   We have parents.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.800]   We were raised into traditions and social norms,
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.280]   and we're raised into an understanding
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.500]   of what's appropriate and inappropriate to do.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.140]   And I think that's a deep intuition.
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.940]   I think that's exactly right.
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.400]   Martin Heidegger, who's the philosopher that Sartre thinks
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.040]   he's sort of taking this from,
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.640]   but I think Sartre's a kind of brilliant
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.560]   French misinterpretation of Heidegger's
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.840]   German phenomenological view.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.600]   Heidegger says a crucial aspect of what it is to be us
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.800]   is our thrownness.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.520]   We're thrown into a situation.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.800]   We're thrown into history.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.720]   We're thrown into our parental lineage.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.160]   And we don't choose it.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.640]   That's stuff that we don't choose.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.360]   We couldn't choose.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.800]   If we were God and we existed outside of time, maybe,
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.760]   but we're not.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.480]   We're finite in the sense that we have a beginning
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.880]   that we never chose.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.640]   We have an end that we're often trying to resist
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.400]   or put off or something.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.400]   And in between, there's a whole bunch of stuff
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.400]   that organizes us without our ever having made the choice
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.080]   and without our being the kind of being
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.680]   that could make the choice to allow it to organize us.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.300]   We have a complicated relationship to that stuff.
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.560]   And I think we should talk about that at a certain point,
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.600]   but the first move is to say,
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.280]   so it's just got a sort of descriptive problem.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:17.120]   He's missed this basic fact that there has to be
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:22.120]   an awful lot about us that's settled
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.640]   without our having made the choice to settle it that way.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.160]   - Right, the thrownness of life.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.200]   - Yeah.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.760]   - That's a fundamental part of life.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.120]   You can't just escape it.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:32.960]   - Exactly.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.600]   You can't escape it altogether.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.440]   - Altogether.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.280]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.360]   You can't escape it altogether.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.880]   - But nevertheless, you are riding a wave
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.840]   and you make a decision in the riding of the wave.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.140]   You can't control the wave, but you should be,
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:49.360]   as you ride it, you should be making certain kinds
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.000]   of decisions and take responsibility for it.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   So why does this matter at all,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.440]   the chain of decisions you make?
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.100]   - Good, well, because they constitute you.
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.160]   They make you the person that you are.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.280]   So what's the opposite view?
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.680]   What's this view against?
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.040]   This view is against most of philosophy from Plato forward.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.260]   Plato says in "The Republic," it's a kind of myth,
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:22.260]   but he says people will understand their condition well
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.640]   if we tell them this myth.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.000]   He says, "Look, when you're born,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.760]   "there's just a fact about you.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.680]   "Your soul is either gold, silver, or bronze."
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.040]   Those are the three kinds of people there are,
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.720]   and you're born that way.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.880]   And if your soul is gold, then we should identify that
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.120]   and make you a philosopher king.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.760]   And if your soul is silver,
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.720]   well, you're not gonna be a philosopher king.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.280]   You're not capable of it, but you could be a good warrior
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.440]   and we should make you that.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.840]   And if your soul is bronze, then you should be a farmer,
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.320]   a laborer, something like that.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:58.180]   And that's a fact about you that identifies you
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.760]   forever and for always,
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.520]   independent of anything you do about it.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.240]   And so that's the alternative view.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.640]   And you could have modern versions of it.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.800]   You could say the thing that identifies you is your IQ
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:15.200]   or your genetic makeup or the percentage
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.560]   of fast-switch muscle fibers you've got or whatever.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.280]   It could be something totally independent
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.140]   of any choice that you've made,
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.400]   independent of the kind of thing
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.660]   about which you could make a choice,
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.400]   and it categorizes you.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.920]   It makes you the person that you are.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.240]   That's the thing that Sartre
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.080]   and the existentialists are against.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:38.600]   - So this idea that something about you
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.920]   is forever limiting the space
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.480]   of possible decisions you can make.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.960]   Sartre says, "No, the space is unlimited."
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.280]   - Sartre is the philosopher of radical freedom.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.760]   - Radical freedom.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.600]   - Yeah, radical freedom.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.840]   And then you could have other existentialists who say,
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.440]   "Look, we are free, but we gotta understand
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.360]   the way in which our freedom is limited
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.560]   by certain aspects of the kind of being that we are.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.360]   If we were radically free, we really would be like God
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.040]   in the traditional medieval sense."
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.760]   And these folks start with the idea that,
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.040]   "Look, whatever we are, that's a kind of limit point
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.880]   that we're not gonna reach.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.240]   So what are the ways in which we're constrained
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.560]   that that being the way the medievals understood him
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.000]   wasn't constrained?"
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.960]   - So can you maybe comment on what is nihilism
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.400]   and is it at all a useful other sort of group of ideas
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.240]   that you resist against in defining existentialism?
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.600]   - Yes, good, excellent.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.600]   So nihilism, the philosopher who made the term popular,
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.160]   although it was used before him as Nietzsche,
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.660]   Nietzsche's writing in the end of the 19th century,
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:53.400]   in various places where he published things,
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.800]   but largely in his unpublished works,
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.760]   he identifies the condition of the modern world
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.360]   as nihilistic.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.720]   And that's a descriptive claim.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.000]   He's looking around him, trying to figure out
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.220]   what it's like to be us now.
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:17.240]   And he says, "It's a lot different from what it was like
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:22.240]   to be human in 1300 or in the fifth century BCE."
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:28.040]   In 1300, like what people believed,
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:33.520]   the way they lived their lives was in the understanding
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.320]   that to be human was to be created
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.360]   in the image and likeness of God.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.400]   That's the way they understood themselves.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:45.400]   And also to be created sinful because of Adam and Eve's
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.760]   transgression in the Garden of Eden.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.120]   And to have the project of trying to understand
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.160]   how as a sinful being, you could nevertheless live
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.760]   a virtuous life.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.760]   How could you do that?
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.480]   And it had to do with, for them,
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.400]   getting in the right relation to God.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.720]   Nietzsche says, "That doesn't make sense to us anymore
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.720]   in the end of the 19th century."
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.880]   "God is dead," says Nietzsche famously.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.060]   And what does that mean?
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:15.080]   Well, it means something like the role that God used to play
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.320]   in our understanding of ourselves as a culture
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.480]   isn't a role that God can play anymore.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.360]   And so Nietzsche says, "The role that God used to play
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.760]   was the role of grounding our existence.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.400]   He was what it is in virtue of which we are who we are."
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.040]   And Nietzsche says, "The idea that there is a being
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.520]   that makes us what we are doesn't make sense anymore."
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.920]   That's like Sartre's atheism.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.520]   Sartre's taking that from Nietzsche.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.320]   And so the question is, what does ground our existence?
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.280]   And the answer is nihil, nothing.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.680]   And so nihilism is the idea that there's nothing
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.840]   outside of us that grounds our existence.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.080]   And then Nietzsche asked the question,
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.840]   "Well, what are we supposed to do about that?
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.280]   How do we live?"
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.640]   And I think Nietzsche has a different story
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.180]   than Sartre about that.
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:12.180]   Nietzsche doesn't emphasize this notion of radical freedom.
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.120]   Nietzsche emphasizes something else.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.800]   He says, "We're artists of life."
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.240]   And artists are interesting
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.560]   because the natural way of thinking about artists
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.280]   is that they're responding to something.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.780]   They find themselves in a situation and they say,
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.760]   "This is what's gonna make sense of the situation.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.600]   This is what I have to write.
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.200]   This is the way I have to dance.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.900]   This is the way I've got to play the music."
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.760]   And Nietzsche says, "We should live like that."
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.880]   There are constraints, but understanding what they are
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:49.880]   is a complicated aspect of living itself.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.840]   And there's a great story, I think, from music
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.960]   that maybe helps to understand this.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.800]   I think Nietzsche, of course, jazz didn't exist
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.400]   when Nietzsche was writing,
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.600]   but I think Nietzsche really is thinking
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.880]   of something like jazz improvisation.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.280]   I mean, he talks about improvisation.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.520]   There's classical improvisation.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.440]   Nietzsche was, by the way, a musician.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.440]   I mean, he was a composer and a pianist,
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.880]   not a great one, really, to be fair, but he loved music.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:23.320]   And Herbie Hancock, who's a pianist, a jazz pianist,
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:28.000]   who played with Miles Davis for quite a while in the '60s,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.040]   tells this kind of incredible story
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:35.260]   that I think exemplifies Nietzsche's view
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:40.260]   about the way in which we bear some responsibility
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.200]   for being creative,
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.780]   and that gives us a certain kind of freedom,
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:50.720]   but we don't have the radical freedom that's art thinks.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.080]   So what's the story?
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.880]   Herbie Hancock says, I think they were in Stuttgart,
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:00.880]   he says, playing a show, and things were great, he says.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:07.880]   He's a young pianist, and Miles Davis is the master.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.000]   And he says, I'm back in the solo,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   and I'm playing these chords, and he says,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   I played this chord, and it was the wrong chord.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.720]   (both laughing)
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.200]   He's like, that's what you gotta say.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.160]   It didn't work right there.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.080]   And I thought, holy mackerel, I screwed up.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.640]   I screwed up, we were tight, everything was working,
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.640]   and I blew it for Miles, who's doing his solo.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:40.480]   And he said, Miles paused for a moment,
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.560]   and then all of a sudden, he went on
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.780]   in a way that made my chord right.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.800]   (laughs)
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.240]   And I think that idea, that you could be an artist
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.240]   who responds to what's thrown at you
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:02.040]   in such a way as to make it right,
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.240]   by what measure, everyone could hear it,
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.720]   is all you can say, right?
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.220]   Everyone knew, wow, that really works.
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.360]   And I think that's not, there are constraints.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.280]   Not anything would have worked there.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.900]   He couldn't have just played anything.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.200]   Most of what anyone would have played
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.360]   would have sounded terrible.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.480]   But the constraints aren't preexisting.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.880]   They're sort of what's happening now in the moment
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.200]   for these listeners and these performers.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.040]   And I think that's what Nietzsche thinks
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.560]   the right response to nihilism is.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.520]   We're involved, but we're not radically free
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.780]   to make any choice and just stand behind it,
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.200]   the way Sartre thinks.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.580]   Our choices have to be responsive to our situation,
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.040]   and they have to make the situation work.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.920]   They have to make it right.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.120]   - And there's something about music too.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.020]   So you basically have to make music
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.320]   of all the moments of life.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.160]   And there is something about music.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.680]   Why is music so compelling?
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.840]   And when you listen to it,
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.120]   something about certain kinds of music,
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.500]   it connects with you.
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.480]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.100]   But in that same way for Nietzsche,
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.120]   you should be a creative force
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.680]   that creates a musical masterpiece.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.520]   - Exactly.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.800]   And I think what's interesting is the question,
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.340]   what does it mean to be a creative force there?
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.600]   There's a traditional notion of creation
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.040]   that we associate with God.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.700]   God creates ex nihilo, out of nothing.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.080]   And you might think that nihilism
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.240]   thinks that we should do that,
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.800]   create ex nihilo,
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.440]   'cause it's about how there's nothing at our ground.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.560]   But I think the right way to read Nietzsche
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.800]   is to recognize that we don't create out of nothing.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.040]   Miles Davis wasn't nothing.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.840]   That situation preexisted him.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.740]   It was given to him, maybe by accident.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.080]   Maybe it was a mistake, whatever.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.560]   But he was responding to that situation
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.440]   in a way that made it right.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.520]   He wasn't just creating out of nothing.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.600]   He was creating out of what was already there.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.040]   - So that makes that first date with the climbing hand
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.200]   even more complicated,
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.080]   'cause you're given a climbing hand,
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.280]   you're gonna have to make art and music out of that.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.120]   - Exactly.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.840]   - And that's the responsibility for both of them.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.240]   Wow, that's a lot of responsibility for a first date,
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.560]   'cause you have to create.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.660]   The emphasis isn't just on making decisions.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.960]   It's on creating.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.320]   - But also on listening, right?
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.640]   I mean, Miles Davis was listening.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.760]   He heard that.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:32.800]   He knew it was wrong.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.640]   And the question was, what do I play that makes it right?
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.120]   - So let me ask about Nietzsche.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.960]   Is God dead?
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.720]   What did he mean by that statement?
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.440]   What's, in your sense, the truth behind the question
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.480]   and the possible set of answers
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.500]   that our world today provides?
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.600]   - Good, so I mean, I think that
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.480]   there's something super perceptive
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.360]   about Nietzsche's diagnosis of the condition
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.360]   at the end of the 19th century.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.520]   So not so far from the condition
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.340]   that I think we're currently in.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.160]   And I think there's an interesting question
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.520]   what we're supposed to do in response.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.840]   But what is the condition that we're currently in?
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.920]   When Nietzsche says God is dead,
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.880]   I think, like I was saying before,
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:23.320]   he means something like the role that God used to play
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.920]   in grounding our existence
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.940]   is not a role that works for us anymore as a culture.
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.140]   And when people talk about a view like that nowadays,
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.640]   they use a different terminology,
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.660]   but I think it's roughly what Nietzsche was aiming at.
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.520]   They say we live in a secular age.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.960]   Our age is a secular age.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.760]   And so what do people mean when they say that?
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.600]   I think, first of all, it's a descriptive claim.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.860]   It could be wrong.
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.840]   The question is, does this really describe
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.400]   the way we experience ourselves as a culture
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.300]   or as a culture in the West or wherever it is that we are?
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.720]   So what does it mean to say that we live in a secular age,
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.160]   an age in which God is dead?
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.760]   Well, first thing is it doesn't mean
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.440]   there are no religious believers 'cause there are plenty.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.880]   There are lots of people who go to church or synagogue
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.320]   or mosque every week or more.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.040]   And there are people who really find that
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.200]   to be an important aspect of the way they live their lives.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.720]   But it does mean that for those people,
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:29.540]   the role that their religious belief plays in their life
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.340]   isn't the same as it used to be in previous ages.
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.140]   So what's that role?
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.760]   We'll go back to the high Middle Ages.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.520]   That was clearly not a secular age.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.400]   That was a religious age.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.240]   And so there we are in 1300,
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.320]   Dante is writing "The Divine Comedy" or something.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.480]   And what did it mean then to live in a sacred age?
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.560]   Well, it meant not just that the default
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.700]   was that you were a Christian in the West,
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:02.000]   but that your Christianity, your religious belief,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   your religious affiliation justified certain assumptions
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.960]   about people who didn't share that religious belief.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.080]   So you're a Christian in the West in 1300
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.800]   and you meet someone who's a Muslim.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.180]   And the fact that they don't share your religious belief
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:26.020]   justifies the conclusion that they're less than human.
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:30.400]   And that was the ground of the Crusades.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.540]   That was the religious wars of the high Middle Ages.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:37.760]   To say that we live in a secular age
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.240]   is to say that not that we don't have,
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.080]   there aren't a lot of people
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.700]   who have religious belief, there are.
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.000]   But it's to say that their religious belief
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.840]   doesn't justify that conclusion.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:53.840]   If you're a religious believer and you meet me
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.800]   and suppose I'm not a religious believer,
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.480]   learning that about me doesn't justify your concluding
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.400]   that I'm less than human.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.880]   And that's the kind of liberalism of the modern age.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.300]   Most of the time we think that's a good thing.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.320]   We let a thousand flowers bloom.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.960]   There are lots of ways to live a good life.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.600]   And there's some way in which that is a nice progressive
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.280]   kind of liberal thought.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.840]   But it's also true that it's an undermining thought
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:25.740]   because it means if you're a religious believer now,
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:31.120]   your belief can't ground your understanding
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.740]   of what you ought to be aiming at in a life
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.460]   in the way it used to be able to.
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.360]   You can't say as a religious believer,
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.400]   I know it's right to do this
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.680]   because you also know that if you meet someone
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.320]   who doesn't share that religious belief
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.040]   and so doesn't think it's right to do that necessarily
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.340]   or does, but for different reasons,
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.760]   you can't conclude that they've got it wrong.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.120]   So there's this sort of unsettling aspect to it.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.280]   - Well, isn't it true that you can't conclude
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.600]   as a public statement to others,
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.180]   but within your own mind,
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:10.060]   it's almost like an existentialist version of belief,
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:15.060]   which is like, you create the world around you.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.800]   It doesn't matter what others believe.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:23.540]   It's actually almost like empowering thought,
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:28.260]   so as opposed to the more traditional view of religion
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.900]   where it's like a tribal idea,
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.980]   like where you share that idea together.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.780]   Here you have the full, back to Sartre,
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.880]   a full responsibility of your beliefs as well.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.480]   - Good, good, but what you're describing
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.240]   is not a religious believer, right?
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.780]   You're describing someone who's found in themselves
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.080]   the ground of their existence
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.000]   rather than in something outside of themselves.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.840]   So the religious belief, I mean, if you go full Sartrean,
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.520]   then, well, you're not in a position to criticize others
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.000]   for the choices that they make,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.760]   but you are in a position to criticize them
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.680]   for the way in which they make them,
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:10.280]   either taking responsibility or not taking responsibility.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.400]   But the religious believer used to be able to say,
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.560]   "Look, the choices that I make are right
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.980]   "because God demands that I make them."
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:22.040]   And nowadays, like,
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.560]   and so it would be wrong to make any others.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.760]   And nowadays, our kind of,
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.440]   to say that we live in a secular age,
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.860]   say, "Well, you can't quite do that
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.920]   "and be a religious believer."
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.600]   Your religious belief can't justify that move
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.880]   and so it can't ground your life in the way it does.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.240]   So it's sort of unsettling.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.740]   I think that's one of the interpretations
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.760]   of what Nietzsche might've meant when he said, "God is dead."
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.360]   God can't play the role for religious believers
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.600]   in our world that he used to.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.760]   But we nevertheless find meaning.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.440]   I mean, you don't see nihilism
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.120]   as a prevalent set of ideas
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.620]   that are overtaking modern culture.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.200]   So a secular world is still full of meaning.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.600]   Good, well, I think that's the interesting question.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:10.280]   I think it's certainly possible for a secular world
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.160]   to be a world in which we live meaningful lives,
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.240]   worthwhile lives,
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:19.240]   lives that are sort of worthy of respect
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.920]   and that we can be proud of aiming to live.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.320]   But I think it is a hard question,
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.880]   what we're doing when we do that.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.620]   And that is the question of existence.
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:33.500]   Sort of what does it mean to exist in a way
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.820]   that brings us out at our best as the beings that we are?
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.940]   That's the question for existentialism.
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.700]   - So besides Sartre,
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:47.700]   who to you is the most important existentialist
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.220]   to understand for others?
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.040]   What ideas in particular of theirs do you like?
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.980]   Maybe other existentialists, not just one.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:55.820]   - Yeah, good.
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.260]   - Who portrays the grounding,
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.640]   strong, atheistic existentialism statement?
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.620]   Who else is there?
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:05.540]   - So I'm teaching an existentialism course now.
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.820]   And I think the tradition goes back
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.680]   at least to the 17th century.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.460]   And I'll just tell you some of the figures
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:13.820]   that I'm teaching there.
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.360]   We could talk about any of them that you like.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.940]   The figure I start with is Pascal.
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:23.940]   Pascal, French mathematician from the 17th century.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.040]   He died, I'm terrible with dates,
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.800]   but I think 1661 or something like that,
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.640]   middle of the 17th century.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.680]   Brilliant polymath, sort of,
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.920]   we have computer languages named after him.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.960]   He built the first mechanical calculating machine.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:43.320]   But he was also deeply invested in his understanding
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.880]   of what Christianity was.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:50.880]   And he thought that everyone before him
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.960]   had really misunderstood what Christianity was.
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.640]   That they'd really attempted to think about it,
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.820]   not as a way of living a life,
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:04.080]   but as a set of beliefs that you can have
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.520]   and which you can justify.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.680]   And I think that's the first move
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.880]   that's really pretty interesting.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:15.400]   And then figures like Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.000]   developed that move.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.600]   And all of those take themselves to be defending
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.640]   an interpretation of a certain kind of Christianity.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.040]   An existential interpretation of Christianity.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.960]   And then I think there are other figures,
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.920]   other theistic figures.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.640]   Figures like Camus and Fanon,
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.840]   who are mid 20th century figures.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.000]   And then I'll just mention the figure
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   who I think is the most interesting is Martin Heidecker.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.560]   He's a complicated figure 'cause--
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.200]   - By the way, when you said, sorry to interrupt,
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.840]   that when you said Camus, you meant atheistic?
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.280]   - I think that Camus is an atheistic existentialist.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.920]   Yeah, I'm happy to talk about that.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.360]   - So, okay, so we got, it's like sports cards.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.200]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.120]   - We have the different existentialists.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.820]   So maybe let's go to,
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.680]   you know what, let's go to Dostoevsky.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.420]   - All right, okay, let's do it.
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.960]   - So my favorite novel of his is "The Idiot."
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:15.280]   First of all, I see myself as the idiot and an idiot.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:19.320]   And I love the optimism and the love
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.080]   the main character has for the world.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.560]   So that just deeply connects with me as a novel.
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.460]   Notes from underground as well.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:32.080]   But what ideas of Dostoevsky's do you think
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.160]   are existentialist?
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.720]   What ideas are formative
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.360]   to the whole existentialist movement?
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.000]   - Excellent, so let me talk about "The Brothers Karamazov."
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.480]   Partly because that's the last novel that Dostoevsky wrote.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.360]   I think it's certainly one of the greatest novels
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.320]   of the 19th century, maybe the best.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.960]   And I'm about to teach it in a few weeks.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.320]   So I'm super excited about it.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.800]   But what is "The Brothers Karamazov" about?
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.640]   I mean, without spoiling the ending for anyone.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.480]   - Spoiler alert.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.880]   - Yeah, I mean, look, it's a murder mystery, right?
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.200]   I mean, the father gets murdered.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.960]   And the question is, who did it?
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.440]   Who's responsible for it?
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.720]   So there's a notion of responsibility here, like in "Sartre."
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.240]   But it's responsibility for a murder.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.120]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.880]   And there's a bunch of brothers,
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:24.200]   each of whom has pretty good motivation
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.760]   for having murdered the father.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.040]   The father's a jerk.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.800]   I mean, he's, you know,
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.160]   if anybody is worthy of being murdered, he's the guy.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:38.160]   He's a force of chaos and he's nasty in all sorts of ways.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.560]   But still, it's not good to murder people.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.600]   (laughs)
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.240]   So what's the view of Dostoevsky?
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.120]   I mean, it's this intense exploration
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:54.120]   of what it means to be involved in various ways
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.440]   with an activity that everyone can recognize as atrocious.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:04.840]   And what the right way is to take responsibility for that,
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.960]   what the right way is to relate to others in the face of it,
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:14.000]   and how even through this kind of action,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.600]   you can achieve some kind of salvation.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.640]   That's Dostoevsky's word for it.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:22.440]   But salvation here and now,
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.480]   not like you live some afterlife
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.800]   where you're paradise for eternity.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:31.000]   Who cares about that, says one of the characters.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.600]   That doesn't make my life now any good,
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.840]   and it doesn't justify any of the bad things
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.080]   that happen in my life now.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.160]   What matters is, can we live well
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.400]   in the face of these things that we do
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.840]   and have to take responsibility for?
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:48.400]   So it's this intense exploration of notions
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.000]   and gradations of guilt and responsibility,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.040]   and the possibility of love and salvation
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.120]   in the face of those.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.760]   It is incredibly human work.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:03.080]   But I think Dostoevsky is the opposite of Sartre.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.720]   And let me just, I think it's so fascinating.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.760]   I don't know anybody else who notices this,
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.880]   but Sartre actually quotes a passage from Dostoevsky
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.600]   when he's developing his view.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.920]   It's close to a passage.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.000]   It doesn't appear quite in this way.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.560]   But the passage that Sartre quotes is this.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.040]   It's in the form of an argument.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.640]   Sartre puts it in the form of an argument.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.760]   He says, "Look, there's a conditional statement is true.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.160]   "If there is no God, then everything is permitted."
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:36.200]   And then there's a second premise.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.640]   There is no God.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.920]   That's Sartre's view.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.080]   I mean, he's an atheist.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.320]   There is no God.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:44.760]   Conclusion, everything is permitted.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.680]   And that's Sartre's radical freedom.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:49.640]   And if you think about the structure
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.200]   of the Brothers Karamazov,
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.480]   I think Dostoevsky, though he never says it this way,
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.240]   would run the argument differently.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.360]   It's a modus tollens instead of a modus ponens.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.400]   The argument for Dostoevsky would go like this.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.040]   Yeah, conditional statement.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.000]   If there is no God, then everything is permitted.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.200]   But look at your life.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.760]   Not everything is permitted.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.360]   You do horrible, atrocious things,
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.560]   like be involved in the death of your father,
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.160]   and there is a price to pay.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.400]   That's not a livable moment.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.160]   To have to take responsibility,
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.760]   to have to recognize that you're at fault
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:32.560]   or you're somehow guilty for having been involved
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.800]   in whatever way you were in letting that happen
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.880]   or bringing it about that it does happen,
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.640]   is to pay a price.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.720]   So we're not beings that are constituted in such a way
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.440]   that everything is permitted.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.880]   Look at the facts of your existence.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.640]   So not everything is permitted.
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.760]   Therefore, there is a God.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.840]   (laughs)
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.320]   And the presence of a God for Dostoevsky,
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.920]   I think, is just found in this fact
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.840]   that when we do bad things, we feel guilty for them,
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.880]   that we find ourselves to be responsible for things,
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.720]   even when we didn't intend to do them,
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.920]   but we just allowed ourselves to be involved in them.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.320]   - And the nature of God for Dostoevsky is, I mean, unclear.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.920]   I mean, it's a very complex exploration in itself.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.880]   And he basically, God speaks through several
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.880]   of his characters in complicated ways.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:26.320]   So it's not like a trivial version of God.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.400]   - It's totally not trivial.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.280]   And it's not a being that exists outside of time.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.680]   None of that is sort of relevant for Dostoevsky.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.600]   For him, it's a question about how we live our lives.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.040]   Do we live our lives in the mood
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.360]   that Christianity says it makes available to us,
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.600]   which is the mood of joy?
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:45.280]   - Is there, maybe this is a bit of a tangent,
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.360]   but so I'm a Russian speaker,
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:52.320]   and one of the, I kind of listen to my heart.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.560]   And what my heart says is I need to take on this project.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:59.000]   So there's a couple of famous translators
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.840]   of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy that live in Paris currently.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.200]   So I'm going to take the journey.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.880]   We agreed to have a full conversation about Dostoevsky,
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:14.680]   about Tolstoy, and like a series of conversations.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.840]   And the reason I fell in love with this idea
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:21.180]   is I just realized in translating from Russian to English,
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:25.680]   how deep philosophical,
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.040]   how much deep philosophical thinking is required.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.080]   Just to, like single sentences.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:35.240]   They spent like weeks debating single sentences.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:38.600]   So, and all of that is part of a journey
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.120]   to Russia for several reasons.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:44.120]   But I just, I want to explore something in me
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:48.240]   that longs to understand and to connect
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.040]   with the roots where I come from.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:55.600]   So maybe can you comment, whether it's on the Russian side
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:00.600]   or the niche of the German side, or other French side,
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:04.580]   is there something in your own explorations
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:08.240]   of these philosophies that you find that you miss
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.400]   because you don't deeply know the language?
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.600]   Or like how important is it to understand the language?
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:15.520]   - Good.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.180]   I think it's super important.
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:20.040]   And I'm always embarrassed that I don't know more languages
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.960]   and don't know the languages I know
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.760]   as well as I would like to.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.160]   But there's a way in.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.520]   So I do think different languages
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.720]   allow you to think in different ways.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.160]   And that there's a sort of a mode of existence,
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:37.140]   a way of being that's captured by a language
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.980]   that it makes certain ways of thinking about yourself
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:41.540]   or others more natural.
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.900]   And it closes off other ways
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:46.500]   of thinking about yourself and others.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:51.140]   And so I think languages are fascinating in that way.
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.900]   The Heidegger, who is this philosopher
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.060]   that I'm interested in, says at one point,
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.860]   "Language is the house of being."
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:01.180]   And I think that means something like,
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:07.300]   it's by living in a language that you come to understand
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.920]   or that possibilities for understanding
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.480]   what it is to be you and others and anything are opened up.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.720]   And different languages open up different possibilities.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.560]   - And we had that discussion offline about James Joyce,
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.160]   how I took a course in James Joyce
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.320]   and how I don't think I understood anything
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.000]   besides the dead and the short stories.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.320]   And you suggested that it might be helpful
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.280]   to actually visit Ireland, visit Dublin,
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.160]   to truly, to help you understand,
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.360]   maybe fall in love with the words.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:42.200]   And so that presumably is not purely about the understanding
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.400]   of the actual words of the language.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.280]   It's understanding something much deeper.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.080]   The music of the language or something.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.300]   Music of the ideas. (laughs)
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.960]   - Absolutely, something like that.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.020]   It's very hard to say exactly what that is,
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:58.220]   but when you hear an Irish person
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:01.800]   who really understands Joyce read some sentences,
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.120]   they have a different cadence,
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.800]   they have a different tonality,
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.240]   they have different music, to use your word.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:10.600]   And all of a sudden you think about them differently.
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:14.120]   And the sentences sort of draw different thoughts out of you
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.460]   when they're read in certain ways.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:18.000]   That's what great actors can do.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.200]   But I think language is rich like that.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:26.520]   And the idea, which philosophers tend to have,
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.560]   that we're really studying the crucial aspects of language
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:33.040]   when we think about its logical form.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.400]   When we think about the sort of claims
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.320]   of philosophical logic that you can make,
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.480]   or how do you translate this proposition
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.660]   into some symbolic form?
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.080]   I think that's part of what goes on in language.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.600]   But I think that when language affects us
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.880]   in the deep way that it can,
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:54.180]   when great poets or great writers or great thinkers
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:58.180]   use it to great effect, it's way more than that.
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.960]   And that's the interesting form of language
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.000]   that I'm interested in.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.380]   - It's kind of a challenge I'm hoping to take on
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:06.500]   is I feel like some of the ideas
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.880]   that are conveyed through language
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.400]   are actually can be put outside of language.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.700]   So one of the challenges I have to do
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:17.280]   is to have a conversation with people in Russian,
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.800]   but for an English audience.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.920]   And not rely purely on translators.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.620]   There would of course be translators there
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:28.620]   that help me dance through this mess of language.
[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:33.160]   But also, my goal, my hope is to dance
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.880]   from Russian to English back and forth
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.480]   for an English speaking audience
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.940]   and for a Russian speaking audience.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.320]   So not this pure, this is Russian,
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.280]   it's going to be translated to English,
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.980]   or this is English, it's going to be translated to Russian,
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:47.740]   but dance back and forth.
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:50.880]   And try to share with people who don't speak
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.080]   one of the languages, the music that they're missing.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.280]   And sort of almost hear that music
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.320]   as if you're sitting in another room
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.320]   and you hear the music through the wall.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.720]   Like get a sense of it.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.600]   I think that would be a waste if I don't try to pursue this,
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.040]   being a bilingual human being.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.540]   And I wonder whether it's possible to capture
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:13.320]   some of the magic of the ideas
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:16.440]   in a way that can be conveyed to people
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.960]   who don't speak that particular language.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.920]   - I think it's a super exciting project.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.280]   I look forward to following it.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.560]   I'll tell you one thing that does happen.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.820]   So we read Dostoevsky in translation.
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.840]   Occasionally I do have Russian speakers in the room,
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.720]   which is super helpful.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:35.440]   But I also encourage my students to,
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:39.360]   some of them will have different translations than others.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:43.480]   And that can be really helpful for the non-native speaker
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:48.360]   because by paying attention to the places
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:51.360]   where translators diverge in their translations
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.720]   of a given word or a phrase or something like that,
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:57.080]   you can start to get the idea that somehow the words
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.920]   that we have in English,
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.520]   they don't have the same contours
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.080]   as the word in Russian that's being translated.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.320]   And then you can start to ask
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.240]   about what those differences are.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:11.260]   And I think there's a kind of magic to it.
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:15.520]   I mean, it's astonishing how rich and affecting
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.000]   these languages can be for people
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.400]   who grew up in them especially, who speak them as natives.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.680]   - And that's a really powerful thing
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.560]   that actually doesn't exist enough of is,
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.440]   for example, for Dostoevsky,
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.180]   most novels have been translated
[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:33.320]   by two or three famous translators.
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.440]   And there's a lot of discussion
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.320]   about who did it better and so on.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.320]   But I would love to, I'm a computer science person,
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:44.600]   I would love to do a diff where you automatically detect
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.680]   all the differences in the translation
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.240]   just as you're saying and use that.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.560]   Like somebody needs to publish literally
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:56.120]   just books describing the differences.
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.040]   In fact, I'll probably do a little bit of this.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.280]   I heard the individual translators in interviews
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.920]   and blog posts and articles discuss particular phrases
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:08.200]   that they differ on, but like to do that for an entire book,
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.520]   that's a fascinating exploration.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.800]   As an English speaker,
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:15.240]   just read the differences in the translations.
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:18.760]   You probably can get some deep understanding
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:23.760]   of ideas in those books by seeing the struggle
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.240]   of the translators to capture that idea.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.040]   That's a really interesting idea, yeah.
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.280]   - Absolutely, and you can do that
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.480]   for other projects in other languages too.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.760]   I mean, one of the, I don't know,
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.640]   I have this weird, huge range of interests.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.920]   And some days I'll find myself reading about something.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.360]   At one point I was interested
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:46.200]   in 14th century German mysticism.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.280]   Okay, turns out there's somebody who's written
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.560]   like volumes and volumes about this.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.800]   He's fantastic.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.520]   And I was interested in reading Meister Eckart.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.480]   I wanted to know what was interesting about him.
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:02.960]   And the sort of move that this guy, Bernard McGinn,
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.200]   who's the great scholar of this period, made,
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:09.960]   was to say what Eckart did, and everybody knows this,
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.760]   he translated Christianity into the vernacular.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.960]   He started giving sermons in German to the peasant.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.080]   And sermons used to be in Latin,
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.120]   and nobody could speak Latin.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.000]   Can you imagine sitting there for a two-hour sermon
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.380]   in a language that you don't know?
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:25.560]   So he translated it into German.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.920]   But in doing it, the resources of the German language
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.240]   are different from the resources of the Latin language.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:34.400]   And there's a word in Middle High German, grund,
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.800]   which is like, we translate it as ground.
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:41.480]   And it's got this earthy feel to it.
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:45.440]   It sort of invokes the notion of soil and what you stand on
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:47.240]   and what things grow out of,
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:51.160]   and sort of what you could run your fingers through
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:54.200]   that would have a kind of honesty to it.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.980]   And there's no Latin word for that.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:00.040]   But in Eckart's interpretation of Christianity,
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.560]   grund, that's like the fundamental thing.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:04.560]   You don't understand God until you understand
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:07.040]   the way in which he is our ground.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.840]   And all of a sudden, this mysticism
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.560]   gets a kind of German cant
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:16.360]   that makes sense to the people who speak German,
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:19.640]   and that reveals something totally different
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:23.240]   about what you could think that form of existence was
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.880]   that was covered over by the fact
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.720]   that it had always been done in Latin.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.480]   Yeah, that's fascinating.
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:32.920]   So, okay, we talked about Dostoevsky
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:36.240]   and the use of murder to explore human nature.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:40.000]   Let's go to Camus, who is maybe less concerned with murder,
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.120]   more concerned with suicide as a way to explore human nature.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:47.520]   So he is probably my favorite existentialist,
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:52.320]   probably one of the more accessible existentialists.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:55.560]   And like you said, one of the people
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:58.640]   who didn't like to call himself an existentialist.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.920]   So what are your thoughts about Camus?
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:03.840]   What role does he play in the story of existentialism?
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.240]   So I find Camus totally fascinating, I really do.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:10.520]   And for years, I didn't teach Camus
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:14.160]   because the famous thing that you're referring to,
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.960]   the "Myth of Sisyphus," which is a sort of essay,
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.840]   it's published as a book, super accessible,
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:23.880]   really fascinating, he's a great writer, really engaging.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.480]   The opening line is something like,
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:31.480]   "There is but one truly significant philosophical question,
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.440]   and that is the question of suicide."
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.800]   And I thought, I can't teach my 18-year-olds.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:37.640]   (ZDoggMD laughing)
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:38.480]   You know, like how?
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.320]   (ZDoggMD laughing)
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.520]   I just thought that's terrible.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:42.800]   Like, how can I?
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:46.400]   I mean, it's not wrong, but do I wanna bring that
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.800]   into the classroom?
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.000]   And so I read it, I read the essay.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.840]   I avoided it for a long time, just because of that line.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.120]   And I thought, I'm not gonna be able to make sense of this
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.760]   in a way that will be helpful for anyone.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.520]   But finally, one year, maybe seven or eight years ago,
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.840]   I sat down to read it.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.920]   I thought, I've got to really confront it.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:10.560]   And I read it, and it's incredibly engaging.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.560]   I mean, it's really, really beautiful.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.720]   And Camus was against suicide,
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.040]   which just turns out to be good.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.480]   (ZDoggMD laughing)
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.160]   I was happy about that.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:23.120]   But he has a bit of a bleak understanding
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:26.120]   of what human existence amounts to.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:31.120]   And so in the end, he thinks that human existence is absurd.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:36.640]   And it's being absurd is a kind of technical term for him.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:41.160]   And it means that the episodes in your life
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:46.180]   and your life as a whole presents itself to you
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:50.240]   as if it's got a meaning, but really it doesn't.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:54.880]   So there's this tension between the way things
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:58.440]   seem to be on their surface
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:02.760]   and what really turns out to be true about them.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.480]   And he gives these great examples.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:06.760]   You probably remember these.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:11.320]   He says, "There you are, you're walking along the street,
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.880]   and there's a plate glass window in a building.
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:15.840]   And through the window,
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.440]   you see somebody talking on a telephone."
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.400]   I mean, I imagined it as a cell phone,
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:23.440]   but Camus didn't. (ZDoggMD laughing)
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.200]   But you see somebody talking on a cell phone,
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:28.760]   and he's animated, he's talking a lot
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.720]   as if things really meant something.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:35.140]   And yet Camus says, "It's a dumb show."
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:39.260]   And it's not dumb just in the sense that it's stupid,
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:41.760]   it's dumb in the sense that it's silent.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:44.920]   It presents itself as if it's got some significance,
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.280]   and yet its significance is withheld from you.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.640]   And he says, "That's what our lives are like.
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:52.240]   Everything in our lives presents themselves to us
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.640]   as if it's got a significance, but it doesn't.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.280]   It's absurd."
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:59.680]   And then he says, "Really what our lives are like,
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.760]   they're like the lives of Sisyphus."
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:06.760]   Just day after day, you do the same thing.
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:10.040]   You wake up at a certain time, you get on the bus,
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.800]   you go to work, you take your lunch break, you get off.
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:17.280]   I have a colleague who once said to me something like this.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:20.360]   It was about October or so in the fall semester.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.680]   I said, "How's it going, Dick?"
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.040]   He said, "Well, you know how it is.
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:27.360]   I got on the conveyor belt at the beginning of the semester
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:32.040]   and I'm just going through and that's the way my life is."
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.800]   And Camus thinks that experience,
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.560]   which you can sometimes have,
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:41.240]   reveals something true about what human lives are like.
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:44.160]   Our lives really just are like the life of Sisyphus
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:48.040]   who rolls this boulder up the hill from morning till night.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:50.600]   And then at night he gets to the top
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.960]   and it rolls back down to the bottom.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:55.240]   Over the course of the night, he walks back down
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.440]   and then he starts it all over again.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:00.400]   And he says, "Sisyphus is condemned to this life."
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:03.560]   Like we're condemned to our lives,
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:06.520]   but we do have one bit of freedom.
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:09.160]   And it's the only thing that we can hang on to.
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:14.080]   It's the freedom to stick it to the gods
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:15.560]   who put us in this position
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.800]   (ZDoggMD laughing)
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.240]   by embracing this existence
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:21.360]   rather than giving up and committing suicide.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:24.800]   And I thought, "Well, it's kind of a happy ending."
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.640]   (ZDoggMD laughing)
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:30.360]   But I also thought it's a dim view
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.080]   of what our existence amounts to.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:37.320]   So I think there's something fascinating about that.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.960]   But what I came to believe,
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:41.600]   and I tried to write about this once,
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:44.320]   I know you read the thing about aliveness
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.760]   that I published once.
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.000]   That's secretly a criticism of Camus.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.200]   I don't think I mentioned Camus in there.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.680]   But I think Camus has got the phenomenon wrong,
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:56.440]   or he's missed some important aspect of it.
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.440]   'Cause in Camus' view,
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.280]   when you experience your day
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:03.000]   as sort of going on in this deadening way,
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.320]   and you're just doing the things that you always do
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.480]   the way you always do them,
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:11.920]   for Camus, that reveals the truth about what our lives are.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.280]   But I think there's some aspect, at least for me,
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.880]   and maybe he just didn't feel this
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.960]   or didn't have access to it.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.320]   Maybe others don't.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.640]   But for me, there's an extra part to it,
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:26.480]   which is somehow that, yes, that's the way things are,
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:29.400]   and it's inadequate.
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:33.000]   And there's something that's missing
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.920]   from that aspect of our existence that could be there.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:40.560]   And it feels like our lives are not about
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:42.360]   just putting up with that
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:45.600]   and sticking it to the gods by embracing it,
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:48.760]   but seeking that absence part of it,
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:52.600]   the part that's recognizable in its absence
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:54.600]   in your experience of that.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:56.800]   And that's what I think.
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.160]   I think we do have the experience of the presence of that
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:04.360]   in moments when you feel truly alive.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.400]   - And that's what you mean by the word aliveness,
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.960]   which is a fascinating and a powerful word.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.720]   - Yeah, that's what I mean by it.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:15.520]   I think most people can recognize moments in their lives
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.480]   when they really felt alive.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.960]   And it could happen in a moment when,
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:23.720]   I don't know, maybe Miles Davis felt it in that moment
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.680]   when he was responding to Herbie Hancock's chord.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:29.280]   Or maybe you feel it in that moment
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.440]   where you grab for the hand on the first date
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.120]   and the gesture is reciprocated.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.000]   Or maybe you feel it in some moment
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.200]   when you are doing a kind of peak athletic thing,
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:45.440]   or watching somebody else do a peak athletic thing.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:48.320]   But I think there are moments when it feels like
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:53.120]   it's not like the way Camus is describing things.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.400]   And it's better because of that.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.720]   - So I think one really powerful way
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:02.160]   for me to understand aliveness
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.840]   is to think about, to go into a darker territory,
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.280]   is to think about suicide.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.920]   And I've known people in my life
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:11.200]   who suffer from clinical depression.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.520]   And whatever the chemistry is in our brain,
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:22.880]   there is a certain kind of feeling that is to be depressed.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.280]   Where you look in the mirror and ask,
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:30.040]   do I want to kill myself today?
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.740]   This is the question that Camus asks,
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:36.400]   this question, this philosophical question.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:41.400]   And there is people who, when they're depressed,
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.480]   say, not only do they say, I want to kill myself,
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.520]   or I don't, they say, it doesn't matter.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:52.360]   And that's chemistry, that's whatever that is,
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.560]   that's chemistry in our mind.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.360]   And then on the flip side of that, for me,
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.400]   I've had some low points, but I've been very fortunate
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.920]   to not suffer from that kind of depression.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.000]   I am the opposite, which is not only moments
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.360]   of peak performance in athletics,
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.920]   or great music, or any of that,
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:18.360]   I'm just deeply joyful often by mundane things.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.500]   Like, as you were saying it,
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.240]   I was drinking this thing and it's cold,
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:26.160]   and for some reason the coldness of that was like,
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.600]   oh, great, like refrigeration, I don't know.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.720]   There was a joy in that, like, I can't put it into words,
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:32.800]   but I just felt great.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.080]   And then just so many things, you look out in nature,
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:40.080]   there's a nice breeze, and just like, it's amazing.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:45.080]   So that doesn't feel like I'm embracing the absurd.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:50.240]   That seems like I'm getting some nice dopamine hits
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.880]   in whatever the chemistry is from just the basics of life.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.960]   And that is the source of aliveness.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:00.880]   However my brain is built, it's gotten a natural
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:05.160]   sort of mechanism for aliveness.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:09.360]   And so one nice way to see the absence of aliveness
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:14.160]   is to look at the chemical, the clinical depression.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.120]   And so Camus doesn't seem to contend with that at all
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.280]   in asking the question of suicide,
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.260]   because when you look in the mirror and ask,
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:25.120]   like if I ask myself, do I want to kill myself today,
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.040]   I ask that question in a different way,
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.680]   more like a stoic way often, like basically every day,
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.080]   is what if I die today?
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.480]   It's more like contemplating your mortality
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.360]   every single day.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:40.760]   You know, that excites me,
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.320]   the possibility that this is my last day.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:47.080]   It just reminds me how amazing life is.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.520]   And that's chemistry, I don't know what that is,
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:54.520]   but that's certainly not some kind of philosophical
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.160]   decision I made.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.720]   I am a little bit riding a wave of the chemistry
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.400]   of the genetics I've been given.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.240]   - Of the dopamine.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.340]   So that question of suicide,
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:10.000]   by the way, do you find that formulation
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.520]   of the question of existentialism,
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:16.040]   I know you didn't want to teach it
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.720]   because obviously suicide is a very difficult word,
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.480]   especially for young minds,
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.520]   but do you think that's a useful formulation
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.460]   of the question of existentialism?
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:28.460]   Like him saying, this is the most important question
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:29.360]   of suicide.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.360]   - I think there is something to it.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.640]   If you read the question as the question,
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.960]   what is it in virtue of which it ought to be desirable
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.760]   to live the lives that we're capable of living?
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.400]   That's a deep question.
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.600]   Yeah, that's a question that gets focused
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.800]   when someone asks themselves whether they ought to continue
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.160]   to live that life.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:55.080]   Who, the famous line,
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:58.560]   nothing focuses the mind more than one's impending execution.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:04.440]   I mean, I think there's something important about that,
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:08.040]   that recognizing the riskiness and the vulnerability
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:12.760]   of one's existence is super important.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:16.200]   And I think that if we didn't have that,
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.740]   our lives wouldn't be capable of being meaningful.
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:23.360]   If they weren't risky and vulnerable,
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.180]   there would be nothing to lose.
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.980]   And it's only because there are things to lose
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.000]   that they can come to have the significance that they do.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.480]   So yeah, I think, not against the idea
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:35.320]   that that's a deep way of approaching the questions
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:38.040]   at the core of existentialism.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.200]   But as you said, I was worried for a while
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.160]   about how I was gonna teach it.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.400]   - Well, I think there's a difference
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.320]   between suicide and not living.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:49.520]   Because suicide is an action.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.700]   So it feels like, to me,
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:57.060]   like suicide doesn't make sense because,
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.560]   imagine you're in a hotel
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.440]   and you're saying the room I'm in sucks.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.720]   But there's other rooms.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.920]   So maybe explore those other rooms.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:12.160]   Maybe you'll find meaning in those other rooms.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:15.040]   Like basically embracing the fact
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.040]   that you don't know everything.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:20.280]   And you need time to explore everything.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.240]   It's like, once you've explored everything,
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.480]   then maybe you can make a full decision.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:30.480]   But it's unfair to make a decision.
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.840]   It's, I would say, unethical to make a decision
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.520]   until you've explored all the rooms in the hotel.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.360]   - Yeah.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.440]   And this gets focused in the brothers Karamazov, of course.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:45.300]   There's one brother who is really asking that question,
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:47.160]   is asking the question of suicide.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:51.160]   He's asking the question whether the world that we live in
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:54.400]   is a world that's worth living in.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:58.440]   And I think that character's, as you say, very ill.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.900]   I mean, and it's possible.
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:05.200]   And often because, as you say,
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.160]   of brain chemistry, physiology.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:11.000]   So there's certainly a physical ground
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.200]   to that situation, to that condition.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:17.680]   But I think it is possible
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.440]   for someone to be in that situation.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.480]   I think that Ivan Karamazov,
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:26.840]   who's the character who's asking this question,
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:30.120]   is maybe, let's say, chemically depressed
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.360]   or something like that.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.480]   But I think there's more to it too.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.840]   And I think that Dostoevsky's real view
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:40.160]   is that brain chemistry doesn't exist on its own.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.960]   Like the way we interact with one another,
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.800]   the way we care about or isolate ourselves from others,
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:51.800]   the way we care for the lives that we lead
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.960]   affects the chemistry of our brain,
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.640]   which goes on and changes the mood that we're in.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.400]   So I think Dostoevsky does think that
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:06.720]   Ivan's salvation, if he's capable of being saved,
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.960]   is gonna come through the love of his brother Alyosha.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.840]   - Let me spring maybe a bit of a tangent on you.
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.160]   Do you ever, one of my other favorite authors
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:19.400]   is Herman Hesse, do you ever include him
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:24.400]   in our deck of sport cards that represent existentialism?
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.400]   - I haven't, maybe I should.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.240]   What should I read?
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.960]   What should I think about including?
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:33.960]   - Oh no, there's some kind of embrace of absurdism.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:39.920]   Like there's a existentialist kind of ideal
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.520]   pervading most of his work.
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:46.160]   But there's more of a, like with Siddhartha,
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.720]   there's more almost like a Buddhist.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:49.560]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:53.760]   - Sort of like watch the river and become the river,
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:57.640]   like this kind of idea that what it means
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.740]   to truly experience the moment.
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.760]   So there is an experiential part of existentialism
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.460]   where you want to, it's not just about,
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:08.000]   we've been talking about kind of decisions and actions,
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.400]   but also what it means to listen, like you said from Nietzsche,
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:14.760]   like what it means to really take in the world
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.440]   and experience the moment.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.280]   So he's very good at writing about
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:20.000]   what it means to experience the moment
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.160]   and experience the full absurdity of the moment.
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.240]   And for him, I'm starting to forget,
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:30.320]   Steppenwolf I think is humor,
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.680]   it's part of the absurdity,
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:35.800]   which I think modern day internet explores very well
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.440]   with memes and so on.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:42.440]   Humor is a fundamental part of the existentialist ethic
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:45.540]   that's able to deal with absurdity.
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:47.180]   You gotta like laugh at it.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.440]   I think there is some,
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.820]   let me just say something about humor,
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:52.520]   'cause I think you're absolutely right.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.840]   Kierkegaard, who is Danish
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:59.100]   and most people think deeply depressed and then so on,
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:01.940]   is actually an incredibly funny writer.
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:05.080]   And someone who was a classmate of mine in graduate school
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.060]   who left philosophy to become a Hollywood comedy writer,
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:11.040]   he's a very successful guy.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.760]   And then he came back 25 years later
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.780]   and finished his dissertation.
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.460]   And I was the reader on the dissertation,
[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:21.500]   but it may be a conflict of interest, I'm not quite sure.
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:24.020]   But his dissertation was about,
[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.180]   he called it Kierkegaard and the funny,
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.660]   which is a kind of a funny title, yeah.
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:32.660]   But Kierkegaard, according to Eric Kaplan's reading,
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:36.140]   Kierkegaard does have this idea
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:40.460]   that there's something destabilizing about humor
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:45.460]   that's crucial to the sort of the absurdity
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:47.900]   of the important possibilities for us.
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:50.700]   And so there's the idea that like,
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:54.260]   there's a moment when a joke is being set up,
[01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:59.020]   when you're sort of proceeding as if you're on stable ground
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:01.540]   and then the punchline comes
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:03.980]   and the rug is pulled out from under you.
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:06.820]   And for a moment, it's like you're falling.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:10.780]   There's nothing supporting you
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:15.300]   until you're captured by your totally new understanding
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:17.140]   of what was going on.
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:20.700]   And that humor necessarily has that kind
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:23.580]   of destabilizing feature to it.
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.500]   And that's like the riskiness.
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.220]   That's like the riskiness that you were pointing to.
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.140]   If there aren't risks in your life,
[01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:32.460]   if your life is totally safe,
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:35.220]   then there's no possibility of significance.
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.380]   And so I think on Eric's reading,
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:41.300]   Kierkegaard sort of wants to line up the importance
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.820]   of the riskiness and vulnerability in your life
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.540]   to its having meaning.
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:48.940]   With the experience of destabilization
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:52.440]   that you get in jokes and comedy,
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.740]   which then becomes significant, right?
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:58.260]   When you remember having heard a joke for the first time,
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:00.500]   it's got a kind of salience for you.
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.420]   - Speaking of jokes and speaking of,
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:05.900]   you mentioned film and literature.
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:08.980]   So existentialism in film and literature.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:13.980]   I think for a lot of people, especially nihilism,
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:17.460]   was experienced in the great work of art,
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:19.540]   modern work of art called Big Lebowski.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.440]   I don't know if you've ever seen that film,
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:26.060]   but there's a group of nihilists in that film.
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:28.020]   They're just like, they don't care about anything.
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:29.300]   I think they happen to be German,
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.300]   at least they have German accents.
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:36.100]   So maybe can you talk about notable appearances
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:38.500]   of existentialism in film?
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:42.860]   And if you at all ever bring up Big Lebowski,
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:45.140]   if that ever comes into play.
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:47.140]   - So I know that people think about the Big Lebowski
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:48.780]   in this context.
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:51.800]   And I did actually rewatch it not so long ago.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.100]   We have kids.
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.780]   Maybe it's time.
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:57.240]   It wasn't really time for the 11 year old.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.660]   So somewhat inappropriate.
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:01.780]   But I have never taught that film.
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:02.900]   So I'd have to think more.
[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:03.780]   We could talk about it.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:06.460]   I'd be happy to try to think on the fly about it.
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:07.700]   - Okay, so I would love to,
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:09.500]   because there is a,
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:12.460]   feels like there's a philosophical depth to that film.
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:17.460]   So there's a person that just, the main character.
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:18.980]   - The Jeff Bridges character.
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:20.380]   - Jeff Bridges character, yeah.
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:24.100]   He kind of, he drinks like these white Russians,
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:28.140]   and he just kind of walks around in a very relaxed way.
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:33.140]   And he radiates both a love for life,
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:36.980]   but also just an acceptance of like,
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:41.100]   it is what it is kind of philosophy.
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:43.020]   And then there's a bunch of characters
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:47.620]   that have very busy lives,
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:50.420]   trying to do some big projects
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.360]   that are dramatic in some way,
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.320]   make some huge amounts of money.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.380]   So it kind of actually reminds me of "The Idiot"
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.580]   by Dostoevsky in a certain kind of sense.
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:00.980]   And then there's these players.
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:03.460]   I mean, they're phrased as nihilists,
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:07.100]   but they kind of don't care to enjoy life.
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.500]   They want to mess with life in some kind of way.
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:13.740]   And of course there's interesting personalities that,
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:18.380]   what is it, Jesus, the bowler.
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:23.180]   And then there's like Donnie, who is a bit clueless.
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:25.420]   And then there's the, always-
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:26.260]   - John Goodman character.
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:27.700]   - John Goodman character,
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:30.400]   is talking about Vietnam and just takes life
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.080]   way too seriously, too intensely and so on.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.960]   So it just paints a full sort of spectrum of characters
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.260]   that are operating in this world.
[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:40.660]   And perhaps most importantly for existentialism,
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:42.620]   are thrown into absurdity.
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:43.460]   - Yeah.
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:45.460]   - And hence the humor.
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:46.740]   - Okay, all right, good.
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:47.580]   Well, that's helpful.
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:49.540]   Thank you for reminding me of all that.
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:53.700]   And I think, so one thing to say is that the nihilists,
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:57.220]   the group of nihilists who call themselves nihilists,
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:15:00.580]   I think they've got a bad misinterpretation
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.980]   of what nihilism is supposed to be.
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:07.380]   And this happened actually in the '20s.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:12.140]   There was a famous case of a couple of German students,
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:16.200]   Leopold and Loeb, who'd read a lot of Nietzsche.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:21.200]   Nietzsche was a kind of hero for the Nazis even,
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:24.940]   I think based on a pretty bad misunderstanding
[01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:26.220]   of what he was up to.
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:30.040]   But Leopold and Loeb had the bad understanding first,
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.540]   and they were students, they'd read a lot of Nietzsche,
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:35.100]   and they thought, okay, nothing means anything.
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:39.100]   The only way that there's any significance in a life
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:42.340]   is through our will to sort of powerfully
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:43.980]   bring something about.
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:47.380]   And if we're gonna do that in a way
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:50.840]   that reflects the fact that nothing means anything,
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:53.540]   then what we should do is take these things,
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:58.180]   these actions that people always thought were bad,
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:01.060]   and do them and show that there's nothing wrong
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:02.380]   with doing them.
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:05.660]   And so they decided they would murder someone,
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:07.420]   not because they were angry at them,
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:08.860]   just someone they'd never met.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:10.940]   It was important that it was someone they'd never met.
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:13.340]   It was a totally unmotivated act.
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:16.580]   And they thought, we'll embrace nihilism
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:19.900]   by showing that we can act in such a way
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:24.900]   as to do something that morality thinks is bad,
[01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:28.820]   and through our will, bring it about that we desire to do it
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:31.260]   for no reason that has anything to do
[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:34.300]   with its potentially being interpretable as good.
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:37.020]   And I think that's a terrible misreading
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:40.940]   of what Nietzsche thinks the response to nihilism is.
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:44.260]   I mean, I think read that against the Miles Davis thing.
[01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:48.180]   Miles Davis aim is to creatively bring it about
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:51.260]   that something works well in a situation
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:52.980]   where he is kind of constrained.
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:54.260]   So they thought two things.
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:57.100]   One, there are no constraints at all,
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:59.420]   not even the constraints of the situation
[01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:00.980]   that we find ourselves in.
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:04.900]   And two, we only become the beings that we really are
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:08.820]   when we act against what you might have thought
[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:10.300]   the constraints were.
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:12.460]   And I just think that's a bad misreading
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:14.060]   of what that kind of nihilism is up to.
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:17.260]   And I think maybe that group in the Big Lebowski
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:20.380]   has got that kind of bad misreading.
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:23.340]   But then the major characters are much more interesting.
[01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:24.540]   Go ahead, you were gonna say something.
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.820]   - So there's some kind of apathy
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:28.860]   to their particular nihilism.
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:33.860]   Could you comment on whether you see sort of apathy
[01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:37.060]   as a philosophy part of that nihilism?
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:41.540]   So like from an existentialist perspective,
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:45.380]   how important is it to care about stuff?
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:48.020]   Like really take on life?
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:51.300]   What does existentialism have to say
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:56.300]   about just sitting back and just not caring?
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:57.420]   - Excellent.
[01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:01.780]   So apathy is like a really important word.
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:05.180]   The Greek word is apatheia, it means without passions.
[01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:08.220]   And the Stoics, who you mentioned earlier,
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:11.500]   really thought that passions are what get in the way
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:14.100]   of your living well.
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:16.780]   Because to live well, you have to think clearly
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:17.820]   about what you should do.
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:21.140]   And you shouldn't let your resentments and your angers
[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:24.580]   and your petty animosities direct your behavior.
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:28.500]   You should release yourself from those kinds of passions.
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:31.740]   So Stoicism, again, huge caricature,
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:36.740]   but it's an aim not to care because caring is bad.
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:41.060]   And there's certain forms of existentialism,
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:44.620]   certainly in Pascal and Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:48.620]   and Heidegger and Sartre in his own way.
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:52.060]   So it's not just a theistic or atheistic thing,
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:57.060]   where what's crucial about us is that we do care.
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:19:00.540]   Heidegger says, "Care is the being of Dasein."
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:02.260]   Dasein is his name for us.
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:06.660]   What it is to be us is to be the being that already cares.
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.940]   And you can't not do that.
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:11.620]   You can pretend you're not doing it,
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:13.260]   but you're just caring in a different way.
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:14.420]   It's like Sartre saying,
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:17.180]   you can pretend you're not taking responsibility.
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:21.420]   Or you can pretend that you don't have to make a decision.
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:23.300]   That is making a decision.
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.380]   Not caring is a way of caring.
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:29.180]   And so I think the existentialists that I'm interested in
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:30.940]   think that we do care.
[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:34.780]   That's constitutive of what it is to be us.
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:37.700]   And so they'll think that the Stoics got it wrong,
[01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:42.180]   but that leaves open a huge range of moves
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:47.180]   about how we inhabit that existence well.
[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:52.780]   - Let me ask about Ayn Rand.
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:53.620]   - Okay.
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:56.980]   - So it just so happens that I've gotten,
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:20:00.740]   she's entered a few conversations in this podcast,
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:03.740]   and just looking at academic philosophy
[01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:05.900]   or just philosophers in general,
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:08.180]   they seem to ignore Ayn Rand.
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:09.940]   Do you have a sense of why that is?
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:14.740]   Does she ever come into play, her ideas of objectivism
[01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:19.460]   come into play of discussions of a good life
[01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:23.820]   from the perspective of existentialism
[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:26.660]   in how you teach it and how you think about it?
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:29.740]   Is she somebody who you find at all interesting?
[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:33.020]   - So no, I don't think she is.
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:36.420]   But it's been a long time since I've read her stuff.
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:37.660]   I read it in high school.
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:40.500]   I read "The Fountainhead" in high school and "Atlas Shrugged,"
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.580]   but that's at this point a very long time ago.
[01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:45.500]   I think I read something about objective epistemology
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:46.820]   or something too.
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:50.700]   So my view about her could be based on a total
[01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:53.700]   misunderstanding of what she's up to.
[01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:56.700]   But sort of my caricature of her,
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:58.900]   and tell me if I've got it wrong,
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:03.900]   is that she's sort of motivated by a kind of,
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:09.460]   I think maybe sometimes you call it libertarianism,
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:13.900]   but maybe let's, in the context of our discussion,
[01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:17.420]   tie it back to Sartre, a kind of view according to which
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:20.020]   we're the being who has to contend with the fact
[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:22.020]   that we're radically free to do stuff
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:25.220]   and we're just not being courageous or brave enough
[01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:26.980]   when we don't do that.
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:29.620]   And the people to admire are the people
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:31.940]   who make stuff out of nothing.
[01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:34.780]   So maybe that's a bad caricature.
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:38.180]   - No, no, no, I think that's pretty accurate.
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:42.460]   I'm not, again, very knowledgeable about the full depth
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:47.460]   of her philosophy, but I think she takes a view
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:51.860]   of the world that's similar to Sartre in the conclusions,
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:56.340]   but makes stronger statements about epistemology
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:59.380]   that first of all, everything is knowable.
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:03.060]   And there's some, you should always operate through reason.
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:05.500]   Like reason is very important.
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:09.500]   Like it's like you start with a few axioms
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.020]   and you build on top of that.
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:15.540]   And the axioms that everybody should operate on
[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:17.060]   are the same.
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:21.540]   Again, reality is objective, it's not subjective.
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:24.860]   So from that, you can derive the entirety
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:28.260]   of how humans should behave at the individual level
[01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:30.060]   and at the societal level.
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:32.260]   And there's a few conclusions.
[01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:34.820]   She would talk about virtue of selfishness
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:37.020]   and sort of a lot of people use that to dismiss her.
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:38.860]   Look, she's very selfish and so on.
[01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:41.900]   She actually meant something very different.
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:43.860]   It's more like the Sartre thing.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:46.540]   Take responsibility for yourself,
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:51.220]   understand what forces you're operating under
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:52.880]   and make the best of this life.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.780]   And that's how you can be the best member of societies
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:58.820]   by making the best life you can.
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:01.860]   And just focus on yourself, like fix your own problems first
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:05.980]   and then that will make you the best member of society,
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:10.700]   of your family, of loved ones, of friends and so on.
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:13.700]   I think the reason she's disliked,
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.740]   obviously on the philosophy side, she's disliked
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:20.120]   because a little bit like Nietzsche, she's literary.
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:25.420]   I think the reason she's publicly disliked
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:28.100]   in sort of public conversations
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:30.920]   is because of how sure she is of herself.
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.060]   So that, which is some of the philosophers
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:35.780]   have been known to do, like make very strong statements
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:37.620]   like hell is other people,
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.580]   but she was making very strong statements
[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:41.820]   about basically everything.
[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:45.980]   And, but the reason I bring her up is,
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:50.940]   she is an influential thinker
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:54.620]   that is not for some reason often brought up as such.
[01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:57.180]   It's not acknowledged how influential she is.
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:00.140]   I was recently looking at like a list
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:05.140]   of the most important women of the 20th century
[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:09.920]   in terms of thought, not science, but like thought.
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.740]   And she wasn't in that list.
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:14.700]   And I just, I've seen this time and time again,
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:16.180]   and it doesn't make sense to me
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:19.540]   why she's so kind of dismissed
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:21.860]   because clearly she's an author
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:25.460]   of some of the most read books like ever.
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:29.760]   And she clearly had very strong ideas
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.280]   that should be contended with, you know,
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.380]   and that's why it kind of didn't make sense to me
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:39.700]   because she's also a creature of her time
[01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.180]   and an important one.
[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:43.260]   She's a creation of the Soviet Union,
[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:45.340]   somebody who left because of that.
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:47.940]   And so some of the strength of her ideas
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:50.620]   has to do with how much she dislikes
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:55.280]   that particular philosophy and way of life.
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:59.100]   But also she's a creature of like Sartre
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:02.180]   and like that's whole like Nietzsche and so on.
[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:04.500]   Now, one of the other criticisms is
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:07.860]   she doesn't integrate herself into this history.
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:10.100]   She keeps basically kind of implying
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:14.580]   that she's purely original in all her thoughts,
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:18.000]   even though she's kind of citing a lot of other people.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.540]   But again, many philosophers do this kind of thing
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:24.660]   as if they are truly original and they're not.
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:25.520]   It is interesting.
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.460]   And also what's interesting about her is she is a woman.
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:30.460]   She is a strong feminist.
[01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:35.060]   And it feels like with Simone de Beauvoir, you know,
[01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:39.220]   like it seems like she's a very important person
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:43.060]   in this moment of history that shouldn't be fully forgotten.
[01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:44.480]   - Interesting, yeah.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:46.700]   Well, so I mean, I don't have a lot to add.
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:50.180]   I will just say this.
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:53.340]   I mean, the way she and Beauvoir seemed to me
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.660]   from your description of her
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:57.360]   and remembering what I remember from 35 years ago,
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.880]   they seem pretty opposite from one another.
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.600]   Like one of the things I find interesting about Beauvoir
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:09.600]   is that she takes seriously the thing that Sartre didn't,
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.920]   which is our throne-ness,
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:16.920]   which is the sense in which we're born into a situation
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:19.860]   that's already got a significance for her.
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:24.440]   I think it was easier for her to recognize that than Sartre
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.040]   because she was a woman.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:29.560]   And Sartre seems to act as if, you know,
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.360]   there are no constraints or at least there shouldn't be.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:36.000]   We're pretty close as, you know, privileged white males.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:36.840]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.800]   - If we could just get rid of the last bits of them,
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:41.480]   we would be God like we're supposed to be.
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:44.920]   And I think Beauvoir sort of sees things differently.
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:49.920]   I think she, one's not born but becomes a woman, she says.
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.440]   So how does that happen?
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.200]   Well, you're thrown into your culture
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.920]   and your culture starts treating you in a certain way
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.120]   because of your gender.
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.600]   And that starts to form your understanding
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.040]   and your experience of things.
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.520]   And by the time you're grown up,
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:06.480]   well, you're pretty well-formed by that.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:09.760]   That seems a fact.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.360]   It's a fact about Sartre too, though,
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.000]   it was harder for him to notice it
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.440]   because he was formed into his privilege.
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:20.360]   - But the world reminds us of our throne-ness
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.880]   for some more than others.
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:23.160]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:27.920]   And for people who have to contend on a daily basis
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:32.920]   with the fact that the social position they're thrown into
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:38.000]   is one that negates them or one that oppresses them
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.760]   or one that sort of pushes them to the side
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.520]   in some way or another.
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:43.960]   I mean, the black experience
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.200]   is interesting in this respect too.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:48.800]   Frantz Fanon, who's a contemporary of Sartre
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:51.200]   and Beauvoir's, writes about it.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.560]   And it's very familiar, the things that he's saying now,
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.560]   but he writes back in the '50s
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.640]   about being a black man in Paris
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:02.800]   and getting on an elevator with a woman alone.
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:07.800]   And how her reaction to him, not knowing him,
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:10.200]   not having any views about,
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.800]   any reason to have any views about him,
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:15.320]   sort of puts him in a particular social position
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.880]   with respect to her.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:21.360]   And if you don't have that experience,
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:25.040]   it's much harder to recognize the way
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:26.440]   in which what we're thrown into
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:28.340]   is something we might not have chosen.
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:34.280]   So the idea that that's not an aspect of our existence,
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:38.960]   which as you describe Ayn Rand's views,
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.160]   she sounds more like Sartre,
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:44.240]   she sounds more like either it's not an aspect
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.720]   of our existence, or at least we ought to sort of aim
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:47.560]   at it's not being an aspect of our existence.
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.480]   - Yeah, almost act as if it's not.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:51.040]   - Yeah, exactly. - Act as if it's not.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.040]   - And so I think from my point of view,
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:56.160]   I don't pretend that I'm explaining
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:57.380]   the public reception of her.
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:00.720]   I'm just sort of trying to say how I understand her
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:03.700]   in this intellectual context.
[01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:07.520]   From my point of view, that's something big to miss.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:10.600]   And the ambition to think that really what's happening
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:13.680]   is that we're all the same, we're all rational beings.
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:15.840]   We're all beings who, if we just got the axioms
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:19.240]   of our existence right and made good judgments
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:24.240]   and reasoned in an appropriate way, would optimize ourselves.
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:30.340]   That feels to me like a kind of natural end point
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:33.600]   of the philosophical tradition.
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:35.760]   I mean, sort of Plato starts off with a view
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.320]   that helps us in that direction,
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:40.960]   and the enlightenment moves us further in that direction.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:45.920]   But from my point of view, that movement has led us astray
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:48.880]   because it's missed something really important
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.760]   that's crucial to the kind of being that we are.
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:55.520]   - Yeah, it misses the music.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.920]   - Exactly, it misses the music.
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:59.320]   - Let's talk about thrownness,
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:02.200]   and I think you mentioned that in the context of Heidegger.
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:03.040]   - Yeah.
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.120]   - So can we talk about Heidegger?
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:05.960]   - Okay.
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.840]   - Who is this philosopher?
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:10.880]   What are some fascinating ideas
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.160]   that he brought to the world?
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.920]   - Okay, so Martin Heidegger was a German philosopher.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:18.560]   I do know when he was born, 1889.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.440]   I know that only by accident.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.520]   It's because it's the same year that Wittgenstein,
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.360]   an Austrian philosopher, was born,
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.120]   and the same year that Hitler was born.
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.280]   So if I've remembered my dates right,
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:31.520]   and someone will call in and correct me otherwise.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:35.080]   But that's the way it sort of sits in my memory bank.
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:37.600]   And it's interesting that the three of them were born
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.400]   at the same time.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:42.960]   Wittgenstein and Heidegger share some similarities,
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:47.680]   but then it's also interesting that Heidegger was a Nazi.
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:49.480]   I mean, this is a very disturbing fact
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:51.880]   about his personal political background.
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:55.280]   And so it's something that anyone who thinks
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:57.920]   that things that he said might be interesting
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.520]   has got to contend with.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:03.240]   - Heidegger was born in Germany, Hitler in Austria.
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:04.160]   - That's right.
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:06.760]   - Wittgenstein is Austria also.
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:09.600]   But so you have to, when you call Heidegger a Nazi,
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:12.120]   you have to remember, I mean,
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:14.000]   there was millions of Nazis too.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.080]   So like there are parts of their,
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.320]   that's the history of the world.
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:22.320]   There's a lot of communists, Marxists,
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:26.400]   and Nazis in that part of history.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:27.320]   - Absolutely.
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:30.320]   And one of the discussion points is,
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:32.960]   well, was he just a kind of social Nazi?
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:36.640]   I mean, you know, he went to parties with them
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:38.160]   and stuff or was he like,
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.080]   did he really believe in the ideology?
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.960]   And that's a choice point.
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:44.880]   And, you know, we can talk about it if you want.
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.680]   He held a political position.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:48.440]   That's one of the relevant parts.
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:52.720]   In 1933, he was made rector of the University of Freiburg.
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:55.000]   That's like the president of the university.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.320]   And that was in Germany, all the universities
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:00.920]   are state universities.
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.240]   And so that's a political appointment.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.720]   - Can we just pause on this point?
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.240]   - Yeah.
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.160]   - From an existentialist perspective,
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:11.920]   what's the role for standing up to evil?
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:17.800]   So, I mean, I think Camus probably had something to say
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:21.600]   about these things 'cause he was a bit of a political figure.
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:23.720]   Like, do you have a responsibility,
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.120]   not just for your decisions,
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:30.320]   but, you know, if the world you see around you
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:35.320]   is going against what you believe somewhere deep inside,
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:39.840]   is ethical, do you have a responsibility
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:43.120]   to stand up to that, even if it costs you your life
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.520]   or your wellbeing?
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.960]   - Well, you asked from an existential perspective,
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.080]   and there's lots of different positions that you could have.
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.000]   So let me tell you something in the area
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.240]   of what I think I might believe,
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:55.360]   which comes out of this tradition.
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:33:01.680]   And it's this, if you live in a community
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:05.560]   where people are being dragged down
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:09.240]   by the norms of the community rather than elevated,
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:13.760]   then there's two things that you have to recognize.
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:17.360]   One is that you bear some responsibility for that,
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.920]   not necessarily because you chose it,
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:23.000]   maybe you reviled it, maybe you were against it,
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.640]   but there's some way in which we all act
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:29.640]   in accordance with the norms of our culture.
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:31.880]   We all give in to them in some way or another.
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:34.800]   And if those norms are broken,
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:37.400]   then there's some way in which we've allowed ourselves
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:40.920]   to be responsible for broken norms,
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:43.000]   or we've become responsible for broken norms.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.480]   And I do think you have to face up to that.
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:48.760]   I think that, let's just take gender norms.
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:51.080]   Maybe the gender norms are broken.
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:53.800]   Maybe the way men and women treat one another
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.440]   or the way men treat women is broken.
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:58.280]   You know, maybe there's, maybe it is,
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.240]   maybe there's, I'm not making a substantive claim,
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:03.680]   I'm just saying, you know, lots of people say it is.
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:08.680]   And if you're in a culture where those norms take root,
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:14.120]   you don't get to just isolate yourself
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:15.720]   and pull yourself out of the culture
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:17.760]   and think I don't have any responsibility.
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:21.320]   You're already a part of the culture,
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:24.560]   even if you're isolating yourself from it.
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:29.040]   That's a way of rejecting the sort of part you play
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:32.880]   in the culture, but it's not a way of getting behind it.
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.120]   Now you're playing that role differently.
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:39.040]   You're saying, I don't wanna take responsibility
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:41.160]   for what's going on around me.
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:44.200]   And that's a way of taking responsibility
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:45.760]   by refusing to do it.
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:47.640]   So I think we're implicated
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:50.480]   in whatever's going on around us.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:53.440]   And if we're gonna do anything in our lives,
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:56.400]   we ought to recognize that,
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:59.040]   recognize that even in situations
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:02.240]   where you maybe didn't decide to do it,
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:05.480]   you could be part of bringing other people down
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:08.440]   and then devote yourself to trying to figure out
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:12.000]   how to act differently so that the norms update themselves.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.880]   And I think this is not a criticism of people.
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:18.960]   The Alyosha who we mentioned in "The Brothers Karamazov",
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:22.800]   he's a character, he's a kind of saintly character
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.560]   in "The Brothers Karamazov".
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:29.560]   But that one crucial moment in that story,
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:34.040]   when he realizes how awful he's been being to someone
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.920]   without ever even intending to do that.
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:40.520]   It's Grushenka, who's this sort of fascinating woman.
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:43.000]   And she's a very erotic woman.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.760]   She's sort of sexual.
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:48.800]   And Alyosha, in my reading of it,
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.600]   is kind of attracted to her.
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:55.080]   But he's a young kid, he's 20 or whatever,
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:56.680]   and he's kind of embarrassed about it.
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:58.160]   And he lives in the monastery
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.160]   and he's thinking maybe he wants to be a priest
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.560]   and he's kind of embarrassed by it.
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:02.760]   So what does he do?
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:05.840]   Every time they run across one another in the street,
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:07.320]   he averts his gaze.
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:10.200]   And why is he doing that?
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:12.560]   'Cause he's kind of embarrassed.
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:14.360]   But how does Grushenka experience it?
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.320]   Well, she knows she's a fallen woman
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.640]   and she knows that Alyosha
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:20.400]   has this other position in society.
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:24.240]   So her read on it is, he's passing judgment on me.
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:27.600]   He can see that he doesn't wanna be associated with me.
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:29.440]   He can see that I'm a fallen woman.
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:32.080]   He knows that in order to maintain his purity,
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:34.880]   he's gotta avoid me.
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.560]   That's not what Alyosha intended to do,
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.560]   but that's the way it's experienced.
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:42.920]   And so there's this way he comes to recognize, oh my God,
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:46.000]   like what I'm supposed to do is love people
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.360]   in Dostoevsky's view of things.
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:51.640]   And what I'm doing instead is dragging this poor woman down.
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:53.160]   I'm making her life worse.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.240]   I'm making her feel terrible about herself.
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:57.040]   And if I actually came to know her,
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.760]   I'd recognize her condition is difficult.
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.520]   She's living a difficult life.
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:03.160]   She's making hard choices.
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:06.680]   And why don't I see that in her face
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.000]   instead of this other thing
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.920]   that's making me wanna avoid her?
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.120]   And that's a huge moment.
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:13.280]   So the idea is that we're implicated
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:15.480]   in bringing other people down,
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:17.440]   whether we wanna be or not.
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.600]   And that's our condition.
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.840]   - The requirement to understand that
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:25.280]   is to be almost to a radical degree,
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:29.520]   be empathetic and to listen to the world.
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:33.760]   And I mean, you brought up sort of gender roles.
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.480]   It's not so simple.
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:36.920]   All of this is messy.
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:39.560]   For example, this is me talking.
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:42.000]   It's clear to me that, for example,
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.640]   the woke culture has bullying built into it,
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:50.920]   has some elements of the same kind of evil built into it.
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:53.880]   And when you're part of the wave of wokeness,
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:56.200]   standing up for social rights,
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:58.680]   you also have to listen and think,
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:00.760]   are we going too far?
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.320]   Are we hurting people?
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:06.720]   Are we doing the same things that others,
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.120]   that we're fighting against
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:10.080]   that others were doing in the past?
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.960]   So it's not simple once you see
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:16.180]   that there's evil being done.
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:18.980]   That it's easy to fix.
[01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:22.720]   No, in our society,
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:26.860]   it's, there's something about our human nature
[01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:31.220]   that just too easily stops listening to the world,
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:33.740]   to empathizing with the world.
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:35.540]   And we label things as evil.
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:37.100]   This is through human history.
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:38.180]   This is evil.
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:39.900]   You mentioned tribes.
[01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:41.900]   This religious belief is evil.
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:42.980]   And so we have to fight it
[01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:45.380]   and we become certain and dogmatic about it.
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:48.900]   And then in so doing, commit evil onto the world.
[01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:53.660]   It seems like a life that accepts
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:56.680]   and responsibility for the norms we're in
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:00.860]   has to constantly be sort of questioning yourself
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:04.780]   and questioning, like listening to the world fully
[01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:09.260]   and richly without being weighed down
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:13.540]   by any one sort of realization.
[01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:15.620]   You just always constantly have to be thinking
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:16.460]   about the world.
[01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:17.280]   Am I wrong?
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.820]   Am I wrong in seeing the world this way?
[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:21.620]   - I mean, the very last thing you said,
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:23.700]   you've constantly gotta be thinking about the world.
[01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:25.220]   You've constantly gotta be listening.
[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.800]   You've constantly gotta be attending.
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:28.620]   And it's not simple.
[01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:30.140]   All that sounds exactly right to me.
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:32.780]   And the phrase that rings through my head
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:34.900]   is another one from the Brothers Karamazov,
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:36.980]   Dmitry, this passionate,
[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:39.460]   sort of sometimes violent brother,
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:44.460]   who is also sort of deeply cares.
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:46.940]   I mean, because he's passionate,
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:49.280]   he's sort of got care through and through,
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:51.140]   but it's breaking him apart.
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:53.060]   He says at one point,
[01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:56.300]   "God and the devil are fighting
[01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:58.580]   "in the battlefield is the heart of man."
[01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:00.180]   (both laughing)
[01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:02.540]   And I just think, yeah, it's not simple.
[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:05.540]   And the idea that there might be a purely good way
[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:08.260]   of doing things, it's just not our condition.
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:11.500]   That everything we do is gonna be sort of undermined
[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:12.900]   by some aspect of it.
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:15.620]   There's not gonna be a kind of pure good
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:18.100]   in human existence.
[01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:21.380]   And so it's sort of required
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:24.980]   that we're gonna have to be empathetic,
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:26.940]   that we're gonna have to recognize
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:31.180]   that others are dealing with that just as we are.
[01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:33.820]   - So I apologize for distracting us.
[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:35.260]   We were talking about Heidegger.
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:36.100]   - Okay.
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:38.940]   - And the reason we were distracted
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:41.500]   is he happened to also be a Nazi,
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:44.980]   but he nevertheless has a lot of powerful ideas.
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:47.340]   What are the ideas he's brought to the world?
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:49.700]   - Okay, so that's a big, huge question.
[01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:53.100]   So let me see how much of it I can get on the table.
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:54.300]   (Lex laughing)
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:57.980]   I mean, the big picture is that Heidegger thinks,
[01:40:57.980 --> 01:41:01.140]   and he's not really wrong to think this,
[01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:06.140]   that the whole history of philosophy from Plato forward,
[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:08.420]   maybe even from the pre-Socratics forward,
[01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:12.420]   from like the sixth century BC to now
[01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:16.380]   has been motivated by a certain kind,
[01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:19.580]   or has been grounded on a certain kind of assumption
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:21.980]   that it didn't have the right to make,
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:24.580]   and that it's led us astray,
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:27.900]   and that until we understand
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:29.820]   the way in which it's led us astray,
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:31.620]   we're not gonna be able to get to grips
[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:34.260]   with the condition we now find ourselves in.
[01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:35.980]   So let me start with what he thinks
[01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:38.900]   the condition we now find ourselves in is.
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:41.820]   Lots of periods to Heidegger's views.
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:44.100]   I'm just gonna sort of mush it all together
[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:45.900]   for the purposes of today.
[01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:49.340]   Heidegger thinks that one of the crucial things
[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:51.380]   that we need to contend with
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:56.180]   when we think about what it is to be us now
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:42:00.860]   is that the right name for our age is a technological age.
[01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:04.700]   And what does it mean for our age to be a technological age?
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:08.280]   Well, it means that we have an understanding
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:12.660]   of what it is for anything at all to be, at all,
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:16.660]   that we never really chose,
[01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:19.420]   that sort of animating the way we live our lives,
[01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:21.780]   that's animating our understanding of ourselves
[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:23.460]   and everything else,
[01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:26.300]   that is quite limited.
[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:29.780]   And it's organized around the idea
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:34.780]   that to be something is to be what's sitting there
[01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:40.260]   as an infinitely flexible reserve
[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:43.740]   to be optimized and made efficient.
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:50.100]   And Heidegger thinks that that's not just the way
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:56.080]   we think of silicon circuits or the river
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:00.600]   when we put a hydroelectric power plant on it,
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:02.800]   we're optimizing the flow of the river
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:05.280]   so that it makes energy which is infinitely flexible
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:07.620]   and we can use in any way at all.
[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:11.160]   It's the way we understand ourselves too.
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:16.160]   We think of ourselves as this reserve of potential
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:19.360]   that needs to be made efficient and optimized.
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:22.600]   And when I talk with my students about it,
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:26.800]   I ask them, "What's your calendar look like?
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:29.960]   What's the goal of your day?
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:32.920]   Is it to get as many things into it as possible?
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:36.360]   Is it to feel like I've failed
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:40.080]   unless I've made my life so efficient
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.520]   that I'm doing this and this and this and this and this
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:45.720]   that I can't let things go by?"
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:49.520]   The feeling that I think we all have
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:52.120]   that there's some pressure to do that,
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:55.160]   to relate to ourselves that way
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:57.600]   is a clue to what Heidegger thinks
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:00.100]   the technological age is about.
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:01.760]   And he thinks that's different
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:04.960]   from every other age in history.
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:07.680]   We used to think of ourselves in the 17th century
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:10.060]   at the beginning of the enlightenment
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:14.480]   as subjects who represent objects.
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:17.640]   Descartes thought that a subject is something,
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:20.660]   some mental sort of realm
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:23.360]   that represents the world in a certain way.
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:25.540]   And we are closed in on ourselves
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:28.400]   in the sense that we have a special relation
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.320]   to our representations.
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.920]   And that's what the realm of the subject is.
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:34.840]   But others, in the Middle Ages,
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:37.000]   we were created in the image and likeness of God.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.300]   And in the pre-Socratic age,
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:43.820]   to be was to be what whooshes up and lingers for a while
[01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:47.440]   and fades away the paradigm of what is,
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:51.880]   where thunderstorms and the anger of the gods,
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:53.640]   Achilles' battle fury,
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:57.200]   and it overtakes everything and stays for a while
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:00.920]   and then leaves, the flowers blooming in spring.
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:02.400]   And that's very different
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:04.640]   from the way we experience ourselves.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:07.200]   And so the question is,
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:09.640]   what are we supposed to do in the face of that?
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:13.760]   And Heidegger thinks that the presupposition
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:18.760]   that's motivated everything from the pre-Socratics forward
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:23.980]   is that there is some entity
[01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:29.460]   that's the ground of the way we understand everything to be.
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:31.380]   For the Middle Ages, it was God.
[01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:33.180]   That was the entity that made things
[01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:35.260]   be the things that they are.
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:40.260]   For the Enlightenment, it was us, maybe for a start, it's us.
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:43.880]   And Heidegger thinks whatever it is
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:46.160]   that stands at the ground of what we are,
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:49.400]   it's not another thing, it's not another entity.
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:51.760]   And we're relating to it in the wrong way
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:53.760]   if we think of it like that.
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:55.640]   There's some way, and this is partly why
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:57.920]   I was interested in Meister Eckhart.
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:01.560]   He says, what there is is there's giving going on
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:06.560]   in the world, and we're the grateful recipient of it.
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:10.560]   And the giving is like, whatever it is,
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:12.960]   it's the social norms that we're thrown into.
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:15.120]   We didn't choose them, they were given to us.
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:16.320]   And that's the ground.
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.000]   That is what makes it possible
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.160]   for anything to be intelligible at all.
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:22.180]   If we lived outside of communities,
[01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:25.120]   if we lived in a world where there were no social norms
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:27.960]   at all, nothing would mean anything.
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:29.680]   Nothing would have any significance.
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:31.840]   Nothing would be regular in the way
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:33.600]   that things need to be regular
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.520]   in order for there to be departures
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.920]   or manifestations of that regularity.
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:43.040]   So community norms are crucial,
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.840]   but they're also always updating.
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:50.760]   We have some responsibility for what they are
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:53.840]   and the way in which they're updating themselves.
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:57.200]   And yet we didn't ever choose it to be that way.
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:02.200]   So those norms are somehow giving significance to us
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:05.800]   in a way that we're implicated in,
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:07.960]   we have some relation to.
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:09.760]   And all that gets covered over
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:13.040]   if you think of us as efficient resources to be optimized.
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:14.880]   Is that a conflicting view
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:18.920]   that we are resources to be optimized?
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:21.440]   Is that somehow deeply conflicting
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:23.880]   with the fact that there's a ground that we stand on?
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:24.700]   Absolutely.
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:27.600]   So what Heidegger thinks is that this is the,
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:31.280]   he calls this the supreme danger of the technological age
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:33.640]   is that without ever having chosen it,
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:35.640]   without ever having decided it,
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:39.040]   this is the way we understand what it is to be us.
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:43.000]   But he thinks that it's also, he says,
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.640]   quoting Hölderlin, this 18th century German poet,
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:49.280]   he says, "In the supreme danger
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:51.160]   "lies the saving possibility."
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.920]   So what does that mean?
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:56.120]   It means that this is the understanding
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:58.240]   that we've been thrown into, that we've been given.
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:00.420]   It's the gift that was given to us.
[01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:01.760]   It's supremely dangerous.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:04.400]   If we let ourselves live that way,
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.280]   we'll destroy ourselves.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:08.680]   But it's also the saving possibility
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:13.680]   because if we recognize that we never chose that,
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:17.320]   that it was given to us,
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:19.680]   but also we were implicated in its being given
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:22.760]   and we could find a way to supersede it,
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:26.200]   that it's the ground, but it's also updatable.
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:28.920]   He calls the ground the groundless ground.
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:32.480]   It's not like an entity, which is there,
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:37.480]   solid, stable, like God, who's eternal and non-changing.
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:39.640]   It's always updating itself.
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:42.840]   And we're always involved in its being updated.
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:45.500]   But we're only involved in it in the right way
[01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:48.220]   if we listen, like Miles Davis.
[01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:54.280]   So optimization is not a good way to live life.
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:58.980]   If you thought that it was obviously clear
[01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:02.020]   that that was the relevant value,
[01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:04.240]   so obviously clear that it never even occurred to you
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:07.080]   to ask whether it was right to think that,
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:08.800]   then you would be in danger.
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:09.920]   Yeah. - Got it.
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:13.960]   So yeah, there is some in this modern technological age
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:16.280]   in the full meaning of the word technology
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:18.520]   that's updated to actual modern age
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:22.040]   with a lot more technology going on.
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:26.860]   It does feel like colleagues of mine in the tech space
[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:30.960]   actually are somehow drawn to that optimization
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:33.240]   as if that's going to save us,
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:35.980]   as if the thing that truly weighs us down
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:39.000]   is the inefficiencies.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:39.840]   - Exactly.
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:42.980]   And I think if you think about other contexts,
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:45.040]   like what are the moments when,
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:47.480]   I mean, we're unique in this respect.
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:50.680]   This period in history is unlike any previous period.
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:52.940]   No, nobody ever felt that way, right?
[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:55.280]   But think about, but it's also true that nobody,
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:58.420]   no previous period in history was nihilistic.
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:00.040]   So our condition is tied up.
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:03.320]   That sort of thing is meant to be a response
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:05.520]   to the felt lack of a ground.
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:10.520]   And so no previous epoch in history felt that way.
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:13.240]   They didn't have our problem.
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:17.240]   But think, so it was much more natural to them
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:22.240]   to experience moments in ways that feel unachievable for us,
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:25.980]   what we were calling moments of aliveness before.
[01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:28.600]   Think about the context in which they felt them.
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:31.760]   They weren't efficient, optimized contexts.
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:33.760]   Think about the Greeks.
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:37.480]   If you ever read Homer, it is a bizarre world back there.
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:39.920]   But one of the things that's bizarre
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:44.920]   is that they're so unmotivated by efficiency and optimizing
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:50.100]   that the only thing that seems to run through
[01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:53.440]   all of the different Greek cultures is the idea
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:56.700]   that if some stranger comes by,
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:59.420]   you better take care of them
[01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:03.600]   because Zeus is the God of strangers
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:04.680]   and Zeus will be angry.
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:05.800]   That's what they say, right?
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:08.220]   But how does it manifest itself?
[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:09.780]   Odysseus, he's trying to get home
[01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:12.020]   and he gets shipwrecked on an island.
[01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:14.820]   And he's trying to figure out,
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:16.660]   he's been at sea for 10 days.
[01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:18.600]   He's starving, he's bedraggled.
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:23.240]   And he sees now Sissa, the princess who's beautiful.
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:25.540]   And he's like, boy, I better, I don't know,
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:28.280]   get some clothes or something.
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:30.880]   I don't want them to beat me up and kill me.
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:34.520]   And so she takes him to the palace.
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:37.600]   They have three days of banquets and festivals
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:39.380]   before they even ask his name.
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:43.200]   It's like, here's a stranger.
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:47.000]   Our job is to celebrate the presence of a stranger
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.880]   because this is where significance lies.
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:52.120]   Now, we don't have to feel that way,
[01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:54.060]   but the idea that that's one of the places
[01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:57.420]   where significance could lie is pretty strongly at odds
[01:51:57.420 --> 01:52:00.080]   with the idea that our salvation is gonna come
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:01.840]   from optimization and efficiency.
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:04.720]   Now, maybe something about the way we live our lives
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:06.840]   will have that integrated into it.
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:12.040]   But it's at odds with other moments.
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:16.520]   - Let me ask you a question about Hubert "Bert" Dreyfus.
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:21.320]   He is a friend, a colleague, a mentor of yours,
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:24.000]   unfortunately no longer with us.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.660]   You wrote with him the book titled,
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:30.480]   "All Things Shining, Reading the Western Classics
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:33.680]   to Find Meaning in a Secular Age."
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:37.920]   First, can you maybe speak about who that man was,
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:39.880]   what you learned from him?
[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:41.980]   And then we can maybe ask,
[01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:44.900]   how do we find through the classics
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:46.580]   meaning in a secular age?
[01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:47.480]   - Okay.
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:53.500]   So Bert Dreyfus was a very important philosopher
[01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:58.220]   of the late 20th, early 21st century.
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:53:03.160]   He died in 2017, about a little over four years ago.
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:04.060]   He was my teacher.
[01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:08.380]   I met him in 1989 when I went away to graduate school
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:10.620]   in Berkeley, that's where he taught.
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:14.220]   He plays an interesting and important role
[01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:16.300]   in the history of philosophy in America
[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:21.300]   because in a period when most philosophers in America
[01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:25.780]   and in the English speaking world
[01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:28.380]   were not taking seriously 20th century
[01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:30.740]   French and German philosophy, he was.
[01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:34.660]   And he was really probably the most important
[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:37.100]   English speaking interpreter of Heidegger,
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:39.620]   the German philosopher that we're talking about,
[01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:41.060]   we've been talking about.
[01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:44.500]   He was an incredible teacher.
[01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:47.260]   A lot of his influence came through his teaching.
[01:53:47.260 --> 01:53:52.260]   And one of the amazing things about him as a teacher
[01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:57.620]   was his sort of mix of intellectual humility
[01:53:57.620 --> 01:54:04.980]   with sort of deep insightful authority.
[01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:09.580]   And he would stand up in front of a class of 300 students,
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:13.100]   he taught huge classes 'cause people love to go see him
[01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:14.980]   and I taught for him for many years,
[01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:20.220]   and say, "I've been reading this text for 40 years,
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:23.180]   "but the question you asked is one I've never asked."
[01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:24.660]   And it would be true.
[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:29.660]   He would find in what people said
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:31.980]   things that were surprising and new to him.
[01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:33.540]   And that's humility actually.
[01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:34.500]   That is.
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:36.020]   Listening to the world.
[01:54:36.020 --> 01:54:38.180]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:54:38.180 --> 01:54:41.260]   He was always ready to be surprised
[01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:43.940]   by something that someone said.
[01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:46.620]   And there's something astonishing about that.
[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:50.780]   So his influence was for people who didn't know him
[01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:52.980]   through his interpretations of these texts,
[01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:55.060]   he wrote about a huge range of stuff.
[01:54:55.060 --> 01:54:57.740]   But for people who did know him, it was through his presence.
[01:54:57.740 --> 01:55:01.860]   It was through the way he carried himself in his life.
[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:05.700]   And so in any case, that's who he was.
[01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:10.540]   I graduated after many years as a graduate student.
[01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:12.580]   I didn't start in philosophy, I started in math,
[01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:14.340]   math and computer science, actually.
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:16.580]   And then I did a lot of work in computational neuroscience
[01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:18.180]   for a few years.
[01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:19.460]   That's a fascinating journey.
[01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:22.860]   We'll get to it through our friendly conversation
[01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:25.940]   about artificial intelligence, I'm sure.
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:28.580]   'Cause you're basically fascinated
[01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:31.900]   with the philosophy of mind, of the human mind,
[01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:36.180]   but rooted in a curiosity of mind through the,
[01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:39.620]   it's artificial, through the engineering of mind.
[01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:41.300]   Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:44.780]   So Bert, I mean, the reason I was attracted to him actually
[01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:48.420]   is because of his, to begin with,
[01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:50.700]   was because of his criticisms of what was called
[01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:54.460]   traditional symbolic AI in the '70s and '80s.
[01:55:54.460 --> 01:55:57.340]   So I came to Berkeley as a graduate student
[01:55:57.340 --> 01:55:59.380]   who'd done a lot of math and a lot of computer science,
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:00.940]   a lot of computational neuroscience.
[01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:05.940]   I noticed that you had, you interview a lot of people
[01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:07.180]   in this world.
[01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:11.420]   And I had a teacher at Brown as an undergraduate,
[01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:13.900]   Jim Anderson, who wrote with Jeff Hinton,
[01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:16.100]   a big book on neural networks.
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:19.140]   So I was interested in that,
[01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:22.060]   not so interested in traditional AI,
[01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:24.260]   like sort of LISP programmings,
[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:26.140]   things that went on in the '80s,
[01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:29.220]   because it felt sort of,
[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:31.180]   when you made a system do something,
[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:34.020]   all of a sudden it was an interesting thing to have done.
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:36.740]   The fact that you'd solved the problem
[01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:37.940]   then made it clear that the problem
[01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:39.660]   wasn't an interesting one to solve.
[01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:40.620]   That's right.
[01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:43.780]   And I had that experience and Bert had criticisms
[01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:48.620]   of symbolic AI, what he called good old fashioned AI,
[01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:49.460]   go-fi.
[01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:52.820]   And I was attracted to those criticisms
[01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:56.940]   because it felt to me that there was something lacking
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:58.780]   in that project.
[01:56:58.780 --> 01:57:00.380]   And I didn't know what it was.
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:02.980]   I just felt its absence.
[01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:07.580]   And then I learned that all his arguments
[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:10.820]   came from his reading of this phenomenological
[01:57:10.820 --> 01:57:12.460]   and existential tradition.
[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:14.100]   And so I had to try to figure out
[01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:15.140]   what those folks were saying.
[01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:17.100]   And it was a long road, let me tell you.
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:19.020]   It took me a long time,
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:21.540]   but it was because of Bert that I was able to do that.
[01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:23.860]   So I own that huge debt of gratitude.
[01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:26.140]   And eventually we went on to write a book together,
[01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:28.180]   which was a great experience.
[01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:31.700]   And yes, we published "All Things Shining" in 2011.
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:34.060]   And that's a book that I definitely
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:37.500]   would not have had the chutzpah to try to write
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:38.540]   if it weren't for Bert,
[01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:42.620]   because it was really about great literature
[01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:43.780]   in the history of the West,
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:47.660]   from Homer and Virgil and Dante to Melville.
[01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:49.580]   There's a huge chapter on Melville,
[01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:52.500]   a big chapter on David Foster Wallace,
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:54.060]   who Bert didn't care about at all,
[01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:56.060]   but I was fascinated by.
[01:57:56.060 --> 01:57:58.740]   And so learning to think that way
[01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:00.620]   while writing that book with him
[01:58:00.620 --> 01:58:04.220]   was an amazing experience.
[01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:06.580]   - So I have to admit,
[01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:08.540]   it's one of my failings in life,
[01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:11.820]   one of many failings is I've never gotten through "Moby Dick"
[01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:15.180]   or any of Melville's works.
[01:58:15.180 --> 01:58:17.420]   So maybe can you comment on,
[01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:20.140]   before we talk about David Foster Wallace,
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:21.660]   who I have gotten through,
[01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:28.300]   what are some of the sources of meaning in these classics?
[01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:30.700]   - Good, so "Moby Dick" I think
[01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:33.780]   is the other great novel of the 19th century.
[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:36.180]   So the brothers Karamazov and Moby Dick,
[01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:38.180]   and they're diametrically opposed,
[01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:40.180]   which is one of the really interesting things.
[01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:42.460]   So Dostoevsky, the brothers Karamazov,
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:46.380]   is a kind of existential interpretation
[01:58:46.380 --> 01:58:48.540]   of Russian Orthodox Christianity.
[01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:52.020]   How do you live that way and find joy in your existence?
[01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:55.300]   "Moby Dick" is not at all about Christianity.
[01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:59.380]   It's about, it sort of starts with the observation
[01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:02.780]   that the form of Christianity
[01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:07.780]   that Ishmael is familiar with is broken.
[01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:11.260]   It's not gonna work in his living his life.
[01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:12.620]   He has to leave it.
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:17.620]   He has to go to sea in order to find what needs to happen.
[01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:20.780]   - And Ishmael is the boating captain,
[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:23.700]   the whaling boat captain.
[01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:26.020]   - So he's not the captain, that's Ahab.
[01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:27.020]   Ahab is the captain.
[01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:28.380]   Yeah, right, let me back up.
[01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:32.020]   The famous opening line to the book is, "Call me Ishmael."
[01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:35.420]   And Ishmael is the main character in the book.
[01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:36.780]   He's a nobody.
[01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:37.780]   He's you and me.
[01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:39.260]   He's the everyday guy.
[01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:41.140]   He's like a nobody on the ship.
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:44.900]   He's like, not the lowest, but certainly not the highest.
[01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:46.500]   He's right in the middle.
[01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:50.020]   And he's named Ishmael, which is interesting
[01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:53.460]   'cause Ishmael is the illegitimate son of Abraham
[01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:55.340]   in the Old Testament.
[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:58.820]   He is the, I think if I have it right,
[01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:00.420]   again, someone will correct me.
[02:00:00.420 --> 02:00:01.260]   (Luke laughs)
[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:06.260]   I think he's the one that Islam traces its genesis to.
[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:12.700]   And so Islam is an Abrahamic religion
[02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:14.780]   like Judaism and Christianity,
[02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:17.460]   but Judaism and Christianity trace their lineage
[02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:21.820]   through Isaac, the quote unquote legitimate son of Abraham,
[02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:24.660]   and Ishmael is the other son of Abraham
[02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:27.080]   who he had with a girlfriend.
[02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:32.860]   And so he's clearly outside of Christianity in some way.
[02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:37.740]   He's named after the non-Christian sort of son of Abraham.
[02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:43.740]   And the book starts out with this, what does he call it?
[02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:48.060]   Something like a dark and misty November mood.
[02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:49.900]   (both laugh)
[02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:53.580]   He's walking along the street and he's overcome by his,
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:56.340]   I can't remember what the word is, but his hypos.
[02:00:56.340 --> 02:00:57.700]   That's what he calls them.
[02:00:57.700 --> 02:01:01.380]   He's in a mood, he's depressed, he's down,
[02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:04.700]   things are not going well, and that's where he starts.
[02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:09.380]   And he signs up to go on this whaling voyage
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:14.380]   with this captain, Ahab, who is this incredibly charismatic,
[02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:20.380]   deeply disturbing character who is a captain
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:24.060]   who's got lots of history and wants to go whaling,
[02:01:24.060 --> 02:01:25.780]   wants to get whales.
[02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:27.820]   That's what they do, they harpoon these whales
[02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:29.460]   and bring them back and sell the blubber
[02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:30.860]   and the oil and so on.
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:35.860]   So he's kind of rich and he's famous and he's powerful.
[02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:37.620]   He's an authority figure.
[02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:41.380]   And he is megalomaniacally obsessed
[02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:43.340]   with getting one particular whale,
[02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:45.020]   which is called Moby Dick.
[02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:47.980]   And Moby Dick is like the largest, the whitest,
[02:01:47.980 --> 02:01:51.020]   the sort of most terrifying of all the whales.
[02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:52.620]   And Ahab wants to get him
[02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:55.580]   'cause a number of years earlier,
[02:01:55.580 --> 02:01:57.500]   he had an encounter with Moby Dick
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:02.500]   where Moby Dick bit off his leg and he survived,
[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:06.540]   but he had this deeply religious experience
[02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:08.180]   in the wake of it.
[02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:11.540]   And he needed to find out what the meaning of that was.
[02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:14.260]   Like, what is the meaning of my suffering?
[02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:17.700]   Who am I such that the world and Moby Dick,
[02:02:17.700 --> 02:02:20.260]   this Leviathan at the center of it,
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:22.500]   should treat me this way?
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:25.620]   And so his task is not just to go whaling,
[02:02:25.620 --> 02:02:27.940]   it's to figure out the meaning of the universe
[02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:32.380]   through going whaling and having a confrontation
[02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:36.060]   with his tormentor, this whale, Moby Dick.
[02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:37.860]   And the confrontation is so weird
[02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:40.700]   because Melville points out that whales,
[02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:45.700]   their faces are so huge, their foreheads are so huge,
[02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:49.260]   and their eyes are on the side of them
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:52.340]   that you can never actually look them in the eye.
[02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:54.820]   And it's kind of a metaphor for God.
[02:02:54.820 --> 02:02:57.580]   Like, you can't ever look God in the face.
[02:02:57.580 --> 02:03:00.060]   That's the sort of traditional thing to say about God.
[02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:02.820]   You can't find the ultimate meaning of the universe
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:04.460]   by looking God in the face.
[02:03:04.460 --> 02:03:07.380]   But Ahab wants to.
[02:03:07.380 --> 02:03:10.940]   He says he's got a pasteboard mask of a face,
[02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:15.100]   but I'll strike through the mask and find out what's behind.
[02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:18.380]   And so Ishmael is sort of caught up in this thing
[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:21.860]   and he's like going whaling 'cause he's in a bad mood.
[02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:23.740]   And maybe this will make things better.
[02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:27.940]   And he makes friends with this guy, Queequeg.
[02:03:27.940 --> 02:03:30.460]   And Queequeg is a pagan.
[02:03:30.460 --> 02:03:33.100]   He's from an island in the South Pacific.
[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:38.100]   And he's got tattoos all over his body, head to toe.
[02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:42.300]   He's party colored, like every different color,
[02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:45.300]   it says, Ishmael, is these tattoos.
[02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:50.300]   And they are the writing on his body, he says,
[02:03:51.340 --> 02:03:54.860]   of the immutable mysteries of the universe
[02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:56.620]   as understood through his culture.
[02:03:56.620 --> 02:04:02.260]   And so somehow Queequeg is this character
[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:05.000]   who is like not Christian at all.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.260]   And he's powerful in a very different way than Ahab is.
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:10.740]   He's supposed to be the king.
[02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:11.860]   He's the son of the king.
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:13.860]   And probably his father's died by now.
[02:04:13.860 --> 02:04:15.780]   And if he went home, he'd be the king.
[02:04:15.780 --> 02:04:17.420]   But he's off on a voyage too,
[02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:18.740]   trying to understand who he is
[02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:20.900]   before he goes back and leads his people.
[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:24.940]   And he's a harpooner, the bravest of the people on the ship.
[02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:28.780]   And he's got the mystery of the universe tattooed
[02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:32.220]   on his body, but nobody can understand it.
[02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:36.060]   And it's through his relation with Queequeg
[02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:39.360]   that Ishmael comes to get a different understanding
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:40.660]   of what we might be about.
[02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:43.740]   So that's Moby Dick, in a nutshell.
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:47.940]   - And connected to a book I have read,
[02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:50.420]   which is funny, there's probably echoes
[02:04:50.420 --> 02:04:53.220]   that represent the 20th century now
[02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:55.940]   in "Old Man and the Sea" by Hemingway
[02:04:55.940 --> 02:05:01.780]   that also has similar, I guess, themes,
[02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:06.820]   but more personal, more focused on the,
[02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:09.020]   I mean, I guess it's less about God.
[02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:11.660]   It's almost more like the existentialist version
[02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:12.820]   of Moby Dick.
[02:05:12.820 --> 02:05:13.660]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:14.860]   - And hence shorter.
[02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:15.820]   - A lot shorter, yeah.
[02:05:15.820 --> 02:05:18.020]   Well, Hemingway was brilliant that way.
[02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:19.260]   - Yeah.
[02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:20.340]   - But do you see echoes,
[02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:23.820]   and do you find "Old Man and the Sea" interesting?
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:25.780]   - It's been since ninth grade that I read
[02:05:25.780 --> 02:05:28.340]   "Old Man and the Sea" even longer ago
[02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:29.860]   than "The Fountainhead."
[02:05:29.860 --> 02:05:31.740]   So I didn't know we were gonna go there.
[02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:33.380]   I mean, I find Hemingway interesting,
[02:05:33.380 --> 02:05:37.440]   but Hemingway, my general sort of picture of him
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:42.440]   is that we have to confront the dangers
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:44.340]   and the difficulties of our life.
[02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:46.180]   We have to develop in ourselves
[02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:48.260]   a certain kind of courage and manliness.
[02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:50.500]   And I think there's something interesting about that.
[02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:53.940]   He's for risk in a certain way.
[02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:55.780]   And I think that's important.
[02:05:55.780 --> 02:06:00.620]   But I do, now I don't have any right to say this
[02:06:00.620 --> 02:06:02.860]   since it's been so long since I read it.
[02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:05.380]   I do feel like there's,
[02:06:05.380 --> 02:06:11.180]   I don't remember a sense for quite the tragedy of it.
[02:06:11.180 --> 02:06:12.860]   Maybe there is.
[02:06:12.860 --> 02:06:14.260]   Is it a melancholy novel?
[02:06:14.260 --> 02:06:15.380]   I don't even remember.
[02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:18.300]   - No, it's, I mean, it has a sense
[02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:20.540]   like "The Stranger" by Camus.
[02:06:20.540 --> 02:06:24.900]   It has a sense of like, this is how life is.
[02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:27.940]   And it like, it has more about old age
[02:06:27.940 --> 02:06:32.940]   and that you're not quite the man you used to be feeling
[02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:36.620]   of like, this is how time passes.
[02:06:36.620 --> 02:06:40.260]   And then the passing of time and how you get old
[02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:43.900]   and you get older, and this is one last fish.
[02:06:43.900 --> 02:06:46.420]   It's less about this is the fish.
[02:06:46.420 --> 02:06:48.860]   It's more like, this is one last fish.
[02:06:48.860 --> 02:06:53.420]   Like, and asking, who was I?
[02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:56.820]   Who was I as a man, as a human being in this world?
[02:06:56.820 --> 02:07:00.140]   And this one fish helps you ask that question fully.
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:01.420]   - Wonderful.
[02:07:01.420 --> 02:07:04.340]   But it's one fish, which is just sort of
[02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:06.220]   all the other fish too, right?
[02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:11.220]   And that is a big difference because for Ahab,
[02:07:11.220 --> 02:07:13.460]   no other fish will do than Moby Dick.
[02:07:13.460 --> 02:07:16.260]   It's gotta be the biggest, the most powerful,
[02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:18.060]   the most tormenting.
[02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:20.380]   It's gotta be the one that you've got history with
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:22.500]   that has defiled you.
[02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:27.020]   And it's a raucous ride, Moby Dick.
[02:07:27.020 --> 02:07:28.020]   - Yeah.
[02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:29.900]   What about David Foster Wallace?
[02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:34.500]   So why is he important to you in the search of meaning
[02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:35.980]   in a secular age?
[02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:39.700]   - Good, so I'll just, just to finish the Moby Dick thing,
[02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:42.020]   I think what's interesting about Melville
[02:07:42.020 --> 02:07:44.780]   is that he thinks our salvation comes
[02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:46.340]   not if we get in the right relation
[02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:48.140]   to monotheism or Christianity,
[02:07:48.140 --> 02:07:51.300]   but if we get in the right relation to polytheism,
[02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:54.860]   to the idea that there's not a unity to our existence,
[02:07:54.860 --> 02:07:56.980]   but there are lots of little meanings
[02:07:56.980 --> 02:07:58.700]   and they don't cohere.
[02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:03.540]   Sometimes, you know, like in Homer,
[02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:05.420]   sometimes you're in love.
[02:08:05.420 --> 02:08:09.180]   Helen's in love with Paris and they do crazy things.
[02:08:09.180 --> 02:08:12.220]   They go off and run away and the Trojan War begins.
[02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:14.860]   And sometimes you're in a battle fury.
[02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:17.820]   Love is Aphrodite's realm and the battle fury,
[02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:19.060]   that's Ares' realm.
[02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:20.580]   And that's a totally different world.
[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:22.820]   And they're not even, I mean, they're related.
[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:25.460]   There's a kind of family resemblance, but not much.
[02:08:25.460 --> 02:08:28.180]   Mostly, you're just in different
[02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:30.180]   sort of local meaningful worlds.
[02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:34.100]   And Melville seems to think that that's a thing
[02:08:34.100 --> 02:08:36.420]   that we could aim to bring back.
[02:08:36.420 --> 02:08:40.660]   He says, we have to lure back the merry May Day gods of old
[02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:45.980]   and lovingly enthrone them in the now egotistical sky,
[02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:47.860]   the now unhaunted hill.
[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:49.980]   That's what, we live in this world where hills
[02:08:49.980 --> 02:08:52.340]   aren't haunted with significance anymore.
[02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:54.700]   And the sky is just a bunch of stuff
[02:08:54.700 --> 02:08:58.460]   that we're studying with physics and astrophysics and stuff,
[02:08:58.460 --> 02:09:01.660]   but they used to be awe-inspiring.
[02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:04.220]   And we have to figure out how to get in that relation
[02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:07.660]   to them, but not by trying to give a unity to our existence
[02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:10.260]   through developing habits and practices
[02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:12.260]   that get written on our body.
[02:09:12.260 --> 02:09:16.140]   And so his is about the end of Judeo-Christianity
[02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:19.780]   and the sort of Roman appropriation of it.
[02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:23.180]   In Wallace, one of the things I think is so interesting
[02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:27.060]   about him is that I think he is a great observer
[02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:29.420]   of the contemporary world.
[02:09:29.420 --> 02:09:31.460]   And he's a very funny writer.
[02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:33.020]   He's really funny.
[02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:35.540]   But he's a great observer of the contemporary world.
[02:09:35.540 --> 02:09:38.580]   And what he thought was at the core
[02:09:38.580 --> 02:09:42.340]   of the contemporary world was this constant temptation
[02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:44.940]   to diversion through entertainment.
[02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:47.180]   That's a different story than Heidegger's story
[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:49.780]   about efficiency and optimization,
[02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:51.340]   but it's the other side of it.
[02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:55.660]   What is this temptation sort of diverting us from?
[02:09:55.660 --> 02:09:57.460]   The ability to be more efficient.
[02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:03.380]   So you're tempted to go watch some stupid film
[02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:06.220]   or television show or something that's dumb
[02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:08.220]   and not really very interesting,
[02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:10.940]   but you read that temptation as a temptation
[02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:13.080]   precisely in virtue of it's taking you away
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:15.900]   from your optimizing your existence.
[02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:18.100]   And so I think they're two sides of the same coin.
[02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:20.420]   I think he's brilliant at describing it.
[02:10:20.420 --> 02:10:23.860]   I think he thought it was a desperate position to be in,
[02:10:23.860 --> 02:10:27.780]   that it was something that we needed to confront
[02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:29.980]   and find a way out of.
[02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:32.940]   And his characters are trying to do that.
[02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:36.700]   And I think there's two different David Foster Wallace's.
[02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:40.700]   One, I mean, David Foster Wallace committed suicide.
[02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:42.700]   And when I, and it's very sad.
[02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:47.060]   And he clearly did have sort of,
[02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:49.620]   there was a physiological basis to his condition.
[02:10:49.620 --> 02:10:50.460]   He knew it.
[02:10:50.460 --> 02:10:53.300]   He was treating it for decades with medication.
[02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:56.780]   He had electroshock therapy a number of times.
[02:10:56.780 --> 02:11:00.100]   It's just very, very sad story.
[02:11:00.100 --> 02:11:01.660]   When I decided that we were gonna write
[02:11:01.660 --> 02:11:03.780]   about David Foster Wallace,
[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:06.420]   the first thing I was worried about is,
[02:11:06.420 --> 02:11:11.420]   can you, like obviously a motivating factor,
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:14.280]   maybe the motivating factor in his committing suicide
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:16.460]   was his physiological condition.
[02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:21.020]   But there was a question.
[02:11:21.020 --> 02:11:24.460]   Could you think, I mean, he's obsessed with the condition,
[02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:28.020]   with what we need to do to achieve our salvation,
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:31.940]   to live well, to make our lives worth living.
[02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:36.940]   And he clearly in the end felt like he couldn't do that.
[02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:39.260]   So in addition to the physiological thing,
[02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:41.380]   which probably most of it,
[02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:45.380]   the question for me was, could you find in his writing
[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:48.940]   what his, what he was identifying
[02:11:48.940 --> 02:11:51.540]   as the thing we needed to be doing
[02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:54.660]   that he nevertheless felt we couldn't be doing?
[02:11:54.660 --> 02:11:58.720]   And he talks as if that's the difficulty for him.
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:01.660]   So that's one side of him.
[02:12:01.660 --> 02:12:03.900]   And I did wanna find that.
[02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:06.100]   I think there's another side of him that's very different,
[02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:06.980]   but you were gonna ask.
[02:12:06.980 --> 02:12:08.900]   No, please, what's the other side?
[02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:13.820]   I mean, what I write about in the chapter mostly
[02:12:13.820 --> 02:12:18.820]   is what I think he's got as our saving possibility.
[02:12:20.940 --> 02:12:22.900]   He thinks our saving possibility,
[02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:26.000]   he says this in a graduation speech that he gave to Kenyon,
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:31.860]   is that we have the freedom to interpret situations
[02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:33.500]   however we like.
[02:12:33.500 --> 02:12:36.380]   So what's the problem case for him?
[02:12:36.380 --> 02:12:40.380]   He says, look, the problem case, we have it all the time.
[02:12:40.380 --> 02:12:42.600]   You get pissed off at the world.
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:47.660]   Some big SUV cuts you off on the highway
[02:12:47.660 --> 02:12:49.180]   and you're pissed off.
[02:12:49.180 --> 02:12:51.900]   And you might express your anger
[02:12:51.900 --> 02:12:54.740]   with one finger or another, right?
[02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:56.420]   Directed at that person.
[02:12:56.420 --> 02:12:58.660]   And he says, but actually,
[02:12:58.660 --> 02:13:02.820]   you're being pissed off as the result
[02:13:02.820 --> 02:13:05.100]   of your having made an assumption.
[02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:08.580]   And the assumption is that that action was directed at you.
[02:13:08.580 --> 02:13:10.260]   Like the assumption is that
[02:13:10.260 --> 02:13:12.580]   you're the center of the universe
[02:13:12.580 --> 02:13:14.860]   and you shouldn't assume that.
[02:13:14.860 --> 02:13:18.580]   And the way to talk yourself out of it, he says,
[02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:21.820]   is to recognize the possibility
[02:13:21.820 --> 02:13:25.060]   that maybe that wasn't an action directed at you.
[02:13:25.060 --> 02:13:29.580]   Like maybe that guy is racing to the hospital
[02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:33.700]   to take care of his dying spouse
[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:36.900]   who's been there suffering from cancer.
[02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:41.580]   Or maybe he's on the way to pick up a sick child.
[02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:44.860]   Or maybe he's, and it's not an action directed,
[02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:46.540]   that was your assumption,
[02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:49.220]   not something that was inherent in the situation.
[02:13:49.220 --> 02:13:52.220]   And I think there's something interesting about that.
[02:13:52.220 --> 02:13:54.940]   I think there's something right about that.
[02:13:54.940 --> 02:13:58.380]   At the same time, I don't think,
[02:13:58.380 --> 02:14:03.380]   he speaks as if we can just spin out these stories
[02:14:03.380 --> 02:14:06.860]   and whether they're true or not doesn't matter.
[02:14:06.860 --> 02:14:10.540]   What matters is that they free us from this assumption.
[02:14:10.540 --> 02:14:11.380]   Yes.
[02:14:11.380 --> 02:14:13.400]   And I think they only free us from this assumption
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:14.240]   if they're true.
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:15.460]   (laughs)
[02:14:15.940 --> 02:14:18.420]   Sometimes the guy really did direct it at you
[02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:20.060]   and that's part of the situation.
[02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:23.200]   And you can't pretend that it's not part of the situation.
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:24.100]   You have to find the right way
[02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:25.420]   of dealing with that situation.
[02:14:25.420 --> 02:14:29.160]   So you have to listen to what's actually happening
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:32.020]   and then you have to figure out how to make it right.
[02:14:32.020 --> 02:14:35.100]   And I think he thinks that we have too much freedom.
[02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:37.620]   He thinks that you don't have to listen to the situation.
[02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:40.860]   You can just tell whatever story you like about it.
[02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:43.820]   And I think that's actually too tough.
[02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:46.660]   I don't think we have that kind of freedom.
[02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:50.360]   And he writes these sort of incredibly moving letters
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:52.460]   when he's trying to write "The Pale King,"
[02:14:52.460 --> 02:14:55.340]   which is the unfinished novel
[02:14:55.340 --> 02:14:58.420]   that really sort of drove him to distraction.
[02:14:58.420 --> 02:15:01.980]   At the center of the novel is this character
[02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:04.420]   who, or one of the characters at the center of the novel
[02:15:04.420 --> 02:15:09.380]   is a guy who's doing the most boring thing
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:11.260]   you could possibly imagine.
[02:15:11.260 --> 02:15:14.180]   He is an IRS tax examiner.
[02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:17.540]   He's going over other people's tax returns,
[02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:20.540]   trying to figure out whether they followed the rules or not.
[02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:24.140]   And like just the idea of doing that for eight hours a day
[02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:26.880]   is just terrifying.
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:31.740]   And he puts this guy in a enormous warehouse
[02:15:31.740 --> 02:15:33.400]   that extends for miles,
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:36.300]   where person after person after person
[02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:39.900]   is in rows of desks, sort of nameless,
[02:15:39.900 --> 02:15:42.440]   each of them doing this task.
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:45.720]   So he's in nowhere doing nothing,
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:47.980]   and it's gotta be intensely boring.
[02:15:47.980 --> 02:15:51.740]   And now the main character's trying to teach himself
[02:15:51.740 --> 02:15:53.400]   to do that.
[02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:56.420]   And the question is, how do you put up with the boredom?
[02:15:56.420 --> 02:16:01.020]   How do you put up with this onslaught of meaninglessness?
[02:16:01.020 --> 02:16:06.020]   And the main character is able to confront that condition
[02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:12.500]   with such bliss that he literally levitates from happiness
[02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:17.180]   while he's going over other people's tax returns.
[02:16:17.180 --> 02:16:20.300]   And that's my metaphor for what I think
[02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:23.400]   Wallace must've imagined we have to try to aspire to.
[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:25.820]   And I think that's unlivable.
[02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:29.500]   I think that's not an ambition that we could achieve.
[02:16:29.500 --> 02:16:31.740]   I think there's something else we could achieve.
[02:16:31.740 --> 02:16:34.060]   And the other thing that we can achieve
[02:16:34.060 --> 02:16:38.340]   that I think is something that he also is onto,
[02:16:38.340 --> 02:16:40.780]   but doesn't write about as often,
[02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:45.780]   is something more like achieving peak moments of significance
[02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:50.820]   in a situation when something great happens.
[02:16:50.820 --> 02:16:54.180]   And he writes about this in an article about Roger Federer.
[02:16:54.180 --> 02:16:55.740]   He loved tennis.
[02:16:55.740 --> 02:16:57.580]   Are you a tennis lover?
[02:16:57.580 --> 02:16:58.780]   I'm not a lover of tennis,
[02:16:58.780 --> 02:17:01.260]   but I played tennis for 15 years and so on.
[02:17:01.260 --> 02:17:05.620]   I don't love it the way people love baseball, for example.
[02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:07.860]   I see the beauty in it, the artistry.
[02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:09.500]   I just liked it as a sport.
[02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:11.820]   Good, okay, well, I didn't play much tennis,
[02:17:11.820 --> 02:17:14.540]   but I hit a ball around every once in a while as a kid.
[02:17:14.540 --> 02:17:17.500]   And I always thought it was boring to watch.
[02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:20.780]   But reading David Foster Wallace on Roger Federer,
[02:17:20.780 --> 02:17:23.300]   you're like, wow, I've been missing something.
[02:17:23.300 --> 02:17:24.140]   And the article,
[02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:25.860]   which appeared in the New York Times Magazine,
[02:17:25.860 --> 02:17:28.620]   was called "Roger Federer as Religious Experience."
[02:17:28.620 --> 02:17:30.820]   Oh, wow, there you go.
[02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:33.740]   And he says, look, there's something astonishing
[02:17:33.740 --> 02:17:37.900]   about watching someone who's got a body like us.
[02:17:37.900 --> 02:17:40.460]   And having a body is a limitation.
[02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:44.220]   It's like the sight of sores and pains
[02:17:44.220 --> 02:17:46.740]   and agony and exhaustion.
[02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:50.580]   And it's the thing that dies in the end.
[02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:53.940]   And so it's what we have to confront.
[02:17:53.940 --> 02:17:56.820]   I mean, there's also joys that go along with having a body.
[02:17:56.820 --> 02:17:58.740]   Like if you didn't have a body, there'd be no sex.
[02:17:58.740 --> 02:17:59.580]   If you didn't have a body,
[02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:03.660]   there'd be no sort of physical excitement and so on.
[02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:08.660]   But somehow having a body is essentially a limitation.
[02:18:08.660 --> 02:18:09.540]   (laughing)
[02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:11.820]   That when you watch someone who's got one
[02:18:11.820 --> 02:18:14.860]   and is extraordinary at the way they use it,
[02:18:14.860 --> 02:18:17.420]   you can recognize how that limitation
[02:18:17.420 --> 02:18:20.380]   can be to some degree transcended.
[02:18:20.380 --> 02:18:24.020]   And that that's what we can get when we watch Federer
[02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:27.220]   or some other great athlete sort of doing these things
[02:18:27.220 --> 02:18:30.940]   that transcend the limitations of their bodies.
[02:18:30.940 --> 02:18:34.100]   And that that's the kind of peak experience
[02:18:34.100 --> 02:18:37.940]   that we're capable of that could be a kind of salvation.
[02:18:37.940 --> 02:18:40.060]   That's a very different story.
[02:18:40.060 --> 02:18:42.220]   And I think that's a livable story.
[02:18:42.220 --> 02:18:45.380]   And I don't know if it would have saved him,
[02:18:45.380 --> 02:18:48.340]   but I feel like I wish he'd developed
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:50.780]   that side of the story more.
[02:18:50.780 --> 02:18:52.180]   - Can we talk about, and first of all,
[02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:55.060]   let me just comment that I deeply appreciate
[02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:59.180]   that you said you were gonna say something.
[02:18:59.180 --> 02:19:01.500]   The fact that you're listening to me is amazing,
[02:19:01.500 --> 02:19:03.220]   like that you care about other humans.
[02:19:03.220 --> 02:19:05.700]   I really appreciate that.
[02:19:05.700 --> 02:19:08.100]   We should be in this way listening to the world.
[02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:12.780]   That's a meta comment about many of the things
[02:19:12.780 --> 02:19:13.940]   we're talking about.
[02:19:13.940 --> 02:19:16.220]   But you mentioned something about levitating
[02:19:16.220 --> 02:19:19.580]   and a task that is infinitely boring
[02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:23.740]   and contrasting that with essentially levitating
[02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:26.380]   on a task that is great,
[02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:31.380]   like the highest achievement of this physical limiting body
[02:19:31.380 --> 02:19:33.300]   in playing tennis.
[02:19:33.300 --> 02:19:34.860]   Now, I often say this,
[02:19:34.860 --> 02:19:38.460]   I don't know where I heard David Foster Wallace say this,
[02:19:38.460 --> 02:19:42.100]   but he said that the key to life is to be unboreable.
[02:19:42.100 --> 02:19:44.540]   That is the embodiment of this philosophy.
[02:19:44.540 --> 02:19:47.900]   And when people ask me for advice,
[02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:50.740]   like young students, you know,
[02:19:50.740 --> 02:19:51.700]   I don't find this interesting,
[02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:52.580]   I don't find this interesting.
[02:19:52.580 --> 02:19:55.500]   How do I find the thing I'm passionate for?
[02:19:55.500 --> 02:19:57.500]   This would be very interesting to explore
[02:19:57.500 --> 02:19:59.220]   because you kind of say that
[02:19:59.220 --> 02:20:02.860]   that may not be a realizable thing to do,
[02:20:02.860 --> 02:20:04.220]   which is to be unboreable.
[02:20:04.220 --> 02:20:07.340]   But my advice usually is life is amazing.
[02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:09.940]   Like you should be able to,
[02:20:09.940 --> 02:20:13.380]   you should strive to discover the joy,
[02:20:13.380 --> 02:20:17.220]   the levitation in everything.
[02:20:17.220 --> 02:20:21.380]   And the thing you get stuck on for a longer period of time,
[02:20:21.380 --> 02:20:23.380]   that might be the thing you should stick to,
[02:20:23.380 --> 02:20:26.460]   but everything should be full of joy.
[02:20:26.460 --> 02:20:31.460]   So that kind of cynicism of saying life is boring
[02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:35.740]   is a thing that will prevent you from discovering the thing
[02:20:35.740 --> 02:20:38.340]   that will give you deep meaning and joy.
[02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:42.140]   But you're saying being unboreable
[02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:45.580]   is not actionable for a human being.
[02:20:45.580 --> 02:20:48.860]   - So, okay, excellent question, deep question.
[02:20:48.860 --> 02:20:53.860]   And you might think, because of the title of the book
[02:20:53.860 --> 02:20:57.660]   that Bert and I wrote, "All Things Shining,"
[02:20:57.660 --> 02:20:59.300]   that I think all things are shining.
[02:20:59.300 --> 02:21:02.060]   (both laughing)
[02:21:02.060 --> 02:21:06.220]   But actually, I think it's an unachievable goal
[02:21:06.220 --> 02:21:07.580]   to be unboreable.
[02:21:07.580 --> 02:21:10.340]   I do believe that you're right,
[02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:14.380]   that a lot of times when people are bored with something,
[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:16.480]   it's 'cause they haven't tried hard enough.
[02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:20.780]   And I do think quite a lot of what makes people bored
[02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:22.580]   with something is that they haven't paid attention
[02:21:22.580 --> 02:21:25.380]   well enough, and that they haven't listened,
[02:21:25.380 --> 02:21:26.700]   as you were saying.
[02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:30.220]   So I do think there's something to that.
[02:21:30.220 --> 02:21:32.300]   I think that's a deep insight.
[02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:36.740]   On the other hand, the perfection of that insight
[02:21:36.740 --> 02:21:41.320]   is that nothing is ever anything less than joyful.
[02:21:42.260 --> 02:21:47.260]   And I actually think that Dostoevsky and Melville both agree,
[02:21:47.260 --> 02:21:50.880]   but in very different ways,
[02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:55.880]   that life involves a wide range of moods,
[02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:59.680]   and that all of them are important.
[02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:01.360]   It involves grief.
[02:22:01.360 --> 02:22:05.400]   I think when someone dies, it's appropriate to grieve.
[02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:09.640]   And it's not, in the first instance, joyful.
[02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:13.680]   It's related to joy, because it makes the joys you feel
[02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:17.280]   when you feel them more intense.
[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:20.760]   But it makes them more intense by putting you
[02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:23.880]   in the position of experiencing the opposite.
[02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:28.240]   And it's only because we're capable of a wide range
[02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:31.660]   of passionate responses to situations
[02:22:31.660 --> 02:22:33.820]   that I think the significances
[02:22:33.820 --> 02:22:36.480]   can be as meaningful as they are.
[02:22:36.480 --> 02:22:40.080]   So Melville, again, has this sort of interest.
[02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:43.760]   I mean, let's just say the guilt and the grief
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:45.480]   in the Brothers Karamazov.
[02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:48.880]   Alyosha loses his mentor, Father Zosima.
[02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:50.000]   He's grieving.
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.520]   It's super important that he's grieving.
[02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:55.880]   He has a religious conversion on the basis of grieving,
[02:22:55.880 --> 02:22:59.300]   where he sees the sort of deep sort of beauty
[02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:02.280]   of everything that is, but it comes through the grief,
[02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:04.360]   not by avoiding the grief.
[02:23:04.360 --> 02:23:06.880]   And Melville says something like,
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:08.640]   Ishmael says something like,
[02:23:08.640 --> 02:23:11.280]   he says, "I'm like a Catskill mountain eagle,"
[02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:14.000]   the Catskills mountains nearby, he says,
[02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:17.480]   "who's sort of flying high above the earth,
[02:23:17.480 --> 02:23:20.540]   "going over the peaks and down into the valleys.
[02:23:20.540 --> 02:23:23.040]   "I have these ups and these downs."
[02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:26.480]   But they're all invested with a kind of significance.
[02:23:26.480 --> 02:23:29.840]   They all happen at an enormously high height,
[02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:31.880]   'cause it's through the mountains that I'm flying.
[02:23:31.880 --> 02:23:35.080]   And even when I'm down, it's a way of being up.
[02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:36.340]   But it's really down.
[02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:38.720]   It's just that it's a way of being up
[02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:40.760]   'cause it makes the ups even upper.
[02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:43.440]   - Well, I guess then the perfectionism of that
[02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:44.720]   can be destructive.
[02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:50.520]   I mean, I tend to see, for example, grief,
[02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:55.520]   loss of love as part of love in that it's a celebration
[02:23:55.520 --> 02:24:01.660]   of the richness of feelings you had when you had the love.
[02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:04.220]   So it's all part of the same experience.
[02:24:04.220 --> 02:24:07.300]   But if you turn it into an optimization problem
[02:24:07.300 --> 02:24:09.820]   where everything can be unbearable,
[02:24:09.820 --> 02:24:11.900]   then that can in itself be destructive.
[02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:13.540]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:24:13.540 --> 02:24:16.540]   I heard this interview with David Foster Wallace
[02:24:16.540 --> 02:24:20.380]   on the internet, where it's a video of him
[02:24:20.380 --> 02:24:23.020]   and there is a foreign sounding reporter
[02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:24.300]   asking him questions.
[02:24:24.300 --> 02:24:27.740]   There's an accent of some sort, German, I think,
[02:24:27.740 --> 02:24:28.820]   something like that.
[02:24:28.820 --> 02:24:31.540]   And I don't know, it just painted a picture
[02:24:31.540 --> 02:24:33.260]   of such a human person.
[02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:35.060]   We were talking about listening.
[02:24:35.060 --> 02:24:37.020]   The interviewer, if I may say,
[02:24:37.020 --> 02:24:41.340]   wasn't a very good one in the beginning.
[02:24:41.340 --> 02:24:45.260]   So she kind of walked in doing the usual journalistic things
[02:24:45.260 --> 02:24:47.060]   of just kind of generic questions
[02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:50.700]   and just kind of asking very basic questions.
[02:24:50.700 --> 02:24:53.780]   But he brought out something in her over time.
[02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:56.980]   And he was so sensitive and so sensitive to her
[02:24:56.980 --> 02:25:00.700]   and also sensitive to being a thinking
[02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:02.700]   and acting human in this world.
[02:25:02.700 --> 02:25:04.580]   That's just painted such a beautiful picture
[02:25:04.580 --> 02:25:07.020]   that people should go definitely check out.
[02:25:07.020 --> 02:25:10.220]   It made me really sad that we don't get this kind of picture
[02:25:10.220 --> 02:25:15.620]   of other thinkers, all of the ones we've been talking about.
[02:25:15.620 --> 02:25:19.180]   Just that almost this little accidental view
[02:25:19.180 --> 02:25:20.740]   of this human being.
[02:25:20.740 --> 02:25:21.580]   I don't know.
[02:25:21.580 --> 02:25:23.960]   It was a beautiful one and I guess there's not many
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:25.700]   like that, even of him.
[02:25:25.700 --> 02:25:26.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:31.920]   No, I think he was more than his writing ability,
[02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:34.020]   which was extraordinary.
[02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:35.860]   He had developed a style that was, I think,
[02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:38.260]   unlike anyone else's style.
[02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:43.780]   Was his sensitivity to other people
[02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:48.780]   and to sort of what he was there to pay attention to.
[02:25:48.780 --> 02:25:55.700]   In one of his essays, I think it's the one called
[02:25:55.700 --> 02:25:58.080]   an incredibly fun thing I'll never do again.
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:00.720]   I didn't know that one about cruise ships.
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:04.440]   I think he describes himself as this sort of roving eyeball
[02:26:04.440 --> 02:26:09.440]   that just sort of walks around the ship, noticing things.
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:12.320]   And he was incredibly good at that.
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:18.160]   But I also worry that that reflects something
[02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:21.400]   that you find in Ivan in the Brothers Karamazov.
[02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:23.720]   Ivan, I don't know if you remember this part,
[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:27.420]   when he's away at school, at college, as a young boy,
[02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:32.420]   he makes money by going around town
[02:26:32.420 --> 02:26:35.140]   to where tragic events have occurred.
[02:26:35.140 --> 02:26:37.060]   Someone just got run over by a carriage
[02:26:37.060 --> 02:26:39.560]   or something just happened.
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:44.140]   And being the first one there, he always knows somehow
[02:26:44.140 --> 02:26:45.860]   where these things are gonna happen.
[02:26:45.860 --> 02:26:49.860]   And writing about it, giving this really good description
[02:26:49.860 --> 02:26:52.100]   and then signing it, "I witness."
[02:26:53.020 --> 02:26:58.020]   And it's as if Ivan's understanding of his life
[02:26:58.020 --> 02:27:02.020]   is that he was supposed to be a witness to it.
[02:27:02.020 --> 02:27:05.780]   He was supposed to see others but not get involved.
[02:27:05.780 --> 02:27:08.020]   He never is interested in trying to keep
[02:27:08.020 --> 02:27:09.340]   the bad things from happening.
[02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:12.420]   He just wants to report on them when he sees them.
[02:27:12.420 --> 02:27:16.420]   And I think that he's an incredibly isolated person,
[02:27:16.420 --> 02:27:21.140]   character, and it's his isolation from others,
[02:27:21.140 --> 02:27:24.100]   from the love of others, and his inability,
[02:27:24.100 --> 02:27:27.140]   his desire not to love others,
[02:27:27.140 --> 02:27:29.580]   'cause that attaches him to someone,
[02:27:29.580 --> 02:27:34.260]   that I think is really at the ground of his condition.
[02:27:34.260 --> 02:27:37.460]   And I think that aim to be isolated,
[02:27:37.460 --> 02:27:39.240]   which many people have nowadays.
[02:27:39.240 --> 02:27:40.860]   I mean, you see it in "The Underground Man" too,
[02:27:40.860 --> 02:27:44.140]   just sort of taking yourself out of the world
[02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:48.420]   because you don't wanna have to take responsibility
[02:27:48.420 --> 02:27:50.820]   for being involved with others.
[02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:52.380]   I think that's a bad move.
[02:27:52.380 --> 02:27:55.380]   And I do worry that maybe,
[02:27:55.380 --> 02:27:57.060]   I mean, I never knew David Foster Wallace.
[02:27:57.060 --> 02:28:00.940]   I have no right to comment on his life.
[02:28:00.940 --> 02:28:05.680]   But he portrays himself in that one episode
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:07.660]   as a person who does that.
[02:28:07.660 --> 02:28:09.260]   And I think that's dangerous.
[02:28:09.260 --> 02:28:11.340]   Yeah, there's some sense in which being sensitive
[02:28:11.340 --> 02:28:12.860]   to the world, like I find myself,
[02:28:12.860 --> 02:28:15.980]   the source of joy for me is just being really sensitive
[02:28:15.980 --> 02:28:19.100]   to the world, to experience.
[02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:21.460]   There's some way, it's quite brilliant
[02:28:21.460 --> 02:28:25.100]   what you're saying that that could be isolating.
[02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:30.100]   It's like Darwin studying a new kind of species
[02:28:30.100 --> 02:28:32.380]   on an island, you don't want to interfere with it.
[02:28:32.380 --> 02:28:34.120]   You find it so beautiful that you don't want
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:35.620]   to interfere with its beauty.
[02:28:35.620 --> 02:28:41.740]   So there is some sense in which that isolates you.
[02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:44.080]   And then you find yourself deeply alone,
[02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:48.060]   away from the experiences that bring you joy.
[02:28:48.380 --> 02:28:49.220]   - Yeah.
[02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:50.940]   - And that could be destructive.
[02:28:50.940 --> 02:28:54.780]   It's fascinating how that works.
[02:28:54.780 --> 02:28:59.780]   And in his case, of course, some of it is just chemicals
[02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:04.940]   in his brain, but some of it is the path,
[02:29:04.940 --> 02:29:09.060]   his philosophy of life led him down.
[02:29:09.060 --> 02:29:11.100]   And that's the danger with Nietzsche too,
[02:29:11.100 --> 02:29:12.600]   in gazing into the abyss.
[02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:17.820]   - Your job is a difficult one,
[02:29:17.820 --> 02:29:21.420]   'cause doing philosophy changes you.
[02:29:21.420 --> 02:29:22.620]   - Yeah.
[02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:26.740]   - And you may not know how it changes you
[02:29:26.740 --> 02:29:29.440]   until you're changed and you look in the mirror.
[02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:35.100]   You wrote a piece in MIT Tech Review
[02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:38.260]   saying that AI can't be an artist.
[02:29:38.260 --> 02:29:44.300]   Creativity is and always will be a human endeavor.
[02:29:44.420 --> 02:29:47.460]   You mentioned Bert and criticism of symbolic AI.
[02:29:47.460 --> 02:29:53.040]   Can you explain your view of criticizing the possible,
[02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:55.780]   the capacity for artistry and creativity
[02:29:55.780 --> 02:29:58.820]   in our robot friends?
[02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:00.940]   - Yeah, I can try.
[02:30:00.940 --> 02:30:07.460]   So to make the argument, you have to have in mind
[02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:14.860]   what counts as art, what counts as a creative artistic act.
[02:30:14.860 --> 02:30:22.180]   I take it that just doing something new isn't sufficient.
[02:30:22.180 --> 02:30:26.760]   I mean, we say that good art is original,
[02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:29.500]   but not everything that's never been done before
[02:30:29.500 --> 02:30:30.320]   is good art.
[02:30:30.320 --> 02:30:35.960]   So there has to be more than just doing something new.
[02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:39.560]   It has to be somehow doing something new
[02:30:39.560 --> 02:30:43.420]   in a way that speaks to the audience
[02:30:43.420 --> 02:30:47.820]   or speaks to some portion of the audience at least.
[02:30:47.820 --> 02:30:52.140]   It has to be doing something new in such a way
[02:30:52.140 --> 02:30:56.660]   that some people who see or interact with it
[02:30:56.660 --> 02:31:00.040]   can see themselves anew in it.
[02:31:00.040 --> 02:31:04.460]   So I think that art is inherently a creative act.
[02:31:04.460 --> 02:31:08.720]   Sorry, a kind of communicative act
[02:31:08.720 --> 02:31:13.340]   that it involves a relation with other people.
[02:31:13.340 --> 02:31:18.340]   So think about the conditions for that working.
[02:31:18.340 --> 02:31:22.260]   Someone, I talk in that article, I can't remember,
[02:31:22.260 --> 02:31:23.380]   something about new music.
[02:31:23.380 --> 02:31:24.900]   I think I don't talk about Stravinsky,
[02:31:24.900 --> 02:31:26.420]   but let's say Stravinsky.
[02:31:26.420 --> 02:31:31.860]   Stravinsky performs the "Rite of Spring"
[02:31:31.860 --> 02:31:34.740]   and there's riots.
[02:31:34.740 --> 02:31:39.520]   It is new and people hate it.
[02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:42.340]   People can't, it sounds like a cacophony.
[02:31:42.340 --> 02:31:43.620]   It sounds awful.
[02:31:43.620 --> 02:31:45.980]   It's written according to principles
[02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:48.700]   that are not like the principles of music composition
[02:31:48.700 --> 02:31:50.880]   that people are familiar with.
[02:31:50.880 --> 02:31:53.760]   So in some ways it's a failed communicative act.
[02:31:53.760 --> 02:31:58.060]   But as Nietzsche says about his own stuff,
[02:31:58.060 --> 02:32:00.620]   I mean, we now can recognize
[02:32:00.620 --> 02:32:03.300]   that it wasn't a failed communicative act.
[02:32:03.300 --> 02:32:06.940]   It just hadn't reached its time yet.
[02:32:06.940 --> 02:32:13.460]   And now that way of composing music is like,
[02:32:13.460 --> 02:32:15.660]   it's in Disney movies.
[02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:19.300]   It's so part of our musical palette
[02:32:19.300 --> 02:32:21.900]   that we don't have that response.
[02:32:21.900 --> 02:32:23.660]   It changed us.
[02:32:23.660 --> 02:32:27.500]   It changed the way we understand what counts as good music.
[02:32:27.500 --> 02:32:29.620]   So that's a deep communicative act.
[02:32:29.620 --> 02:32:34.620]   It didn't perform its communication in that opening moment,
[02:32:34.620 --> 02:32:40.260]   but it did ultimately establish a new understanding
[02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:42.300]   for all of us of what counts as good art.
[02:32:42.300 --> 02:32:45.140]   And that's the kind of deep communication
[02:32:45.140 --> 02:32:47.180]   that I think good art can do.
[02:32:47.180 --> 02:32:52.060]   It can change our understanding of ourselves
[02:32:52.060 --> 02:32:55.940]   and of what a good manifestation of something of ourselves
[02:32:55.940 --> 02:32:57.620]   in a certain domain is.
[02:32:57.620 --> 02:33:00.420]   - And you use the term socially embedded,
[02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:04.260]   that art is fundamentally socially embedded.
[02:33:04.260 --> 02:33:05.860]   And I really like that term
[02:33:05.860 --> 02:33:10.260]   because I see my love for artificial intelligence
[02:33:10.260 --> 02:33:12.460]   and the kind of system that we can bring to the world
[02:33:12.460 --> 02:33:17.460]   that could make for an interesting and more lively world
[02:33:17.460 --> 02:33:19.860]   and one that enriches human beings
[02:33:19.860 --> 02:33:24.060]   is one where the AI systems are deeply socially embedded.
[02:33:24.060 --> 02:33:25.140]   - Good, yeah.
[02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:27.540]   And that actually is in contrast
[02:33:27.540 --> 02:33:30.220]   to the way artificial intelligence
[02:33:30.220 --> 02:33:32.220]   have been talked about throughout its history
[02:33:32.220 --> 02:33:35.460]   and certainly now, both on the robotic side and the AI side,
[02:33:35.460 --> 02:33:38.580]   especially on the tech sector
[02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:41.740]   where the businesses around AI,
[02:33:41.740 --> 02:33:45.220]   they kind of want to create systems
[02:33:45.220 --> 02:33:48.380]   that are like servants to humans.
[02:33:48.380 --> 02:33:52.740]   And then humans do all the beautiful human messiness
[02:33:52.740 --> 02:33:55.500]   of where art would be part.
[02:33:55.500 --> 02:33:58.540]   I think that there is no reason
[02:33:58.540 --> 02:34:01.580]   why you can't integrate AI systems
[02:34:01.580 --> 02:34:04.800]   in the way you integrate new humans to the picture.
[02:34:04.800 --> 02:34:07.540]   There are just the full diversity and the flaws,
[02:34:07.540 --> 02:34:10.040]   all of that adds to the thing.
[02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:15.500]   Some people might say that AlphaZero
[02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:20.500]   is this system from DeepMind that was able to achieve,
[02:34:22.260 --> 02:34:24.180]   solve the game, it beat the best people in the world
[02:34:24.180 --> 02:34:27.980]   at the game of Go with no supervision from humans.
[02:34:27.980 --> 02:34:30.780]   But more interestingly to me, on the side of creativity,
[02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:34.380]   it was able to surprise a lot of grandmasters
[02:34:34.380 --> 02:34:36.580]   with the kind of moves they came up with.
[02:34:36.580 --> 02:34:40.380]   Now, to me, that's not the creativity,
[02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:42.180]   the magic that's socially embedded
[02:34:42.180 --> 02:34:43.460]   that we're talking about.
[02:34:43.460 --> 02:34:47.760]   That is merely revealing the limitations
[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:50.760]   of humans to discover.
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:55.040]   It's like to solve a particular aspect of a math problem.
[02:34:55.040 --> 02:35:00.940]   I think creativity is not just even socially embedded,
[02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:04.820]   it's the way you're saying,
[02:35:04.820 --> 02:35:07.460]   is this part of the communicative act.
[02:35:07.460 --> 02:35:11.140]   It's the interactive, it's the dance with the culture.
[02:35:11.140 --> 02:35:15.220]   And so it has to be like for AlphaZero
[02:35:15.220 --> 02:35:17.780]   to be creative, truly creative,
[02:35:17.780 --> 02:35:20.180]   it would have to be integrated in a way
[02:35:20.180 --> 02:35:22.200]   where it has a Twitter account
[02:35:22.200 --> 02:35:26.260]   and it becomes aware of the impact
[02:35:26.260 --> 02:35:28.100]   it has on the other grandmasters
[02:35:28.100 --> 02:35:30.100]   with the moves that's coming up.
[02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:33.440]   And one of the fascinating things about AlphaZero,
[02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:37.020]   which I just love so much,
[02:35:37.020 --> 02:35:39.020]   is I don't know if you're familiar with chess.
[02:35:39.020 --> 02:35:39.860]   - I am, yeah.
[02:35:39.860 --> 02:35:43.140]   - Okay, so it does certain things
[02:35:43.140 --> 02:35:45.880]   that most chess players, even at the highest level,
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:49.260]   don't do, which is it sacrifices pieces,
[02:35:49.260 --> 02:35:50.820]   it gives pieces away,
[02:35:50.820 --> 02:35:55.500]   and then waits like 10 moves before it pays you back.
[02:35:55.500 --> 02:35:57.800]   So to me, that's beautiful.
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:01.900]   That's art if only AlphaZero understood
[02:36:01.900 --> 02:36:03.360]   the artistry of that,
[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:07.140]   which is I'm going to mess with you psychologically
[02:36:07.140 --> 02:36:09.860]   because I'm going to do two things.
[02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:14.280]   One, make you feel overconfident that you're doing well,
[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:16.360]   but actually also once you realize
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:19.220]   you are playing AlphaZero that is much better than you,
[02:36:19.220 --> 02:36:22.420]   you're going to feel really nervous about what's on the way.
[02:36:22.420 --> 02:36:24.540]   Like this is the calm before the storm.
[02:36:24.540 --> 02:36:28.800]   And that creates a beautiful psychological masterpiece
[02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:29.960]   of this chess game.
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:33.620]   If only AlphaZero was then messing with you
[02:36:33.620 --> 02:36:34.980]   additionally to that,
[02:36:34.980 --> 02:36:37.480]   like was cognizant of this doing that,
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:38.940]   then it becomes art.
[02:36:38.940 --> 02:36:42.860]   And then it's integrated into society in that way.
[02:36:42.860 --> 02:36:45.780]   And I believe it doesn't have to actually have
[02:36:45.780 --> 02:36:50.780]   an understanding of the world in the way that humans have.
[02:36:50.780 --> 02:36:52.660]   It can have a different one.
[02:36:52.660 --> 02:36:55.620]   It can be like a child is as clueless
[02:36:55.620 --> 02:36:58.540]   about so many aspects of the world and it's okay.
[02:36:58.540 --> 02:37:00.720]   And that's part of the magic of it.
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:01.740]   Just being flawed,
[02:37:01.740 --> 02:37:05.420]   being lacking understanding all interesting kinds of ways,
[02:37:05.420 --> 02:37:06.620]   but interacting.
[02:37:06.620 --> 02:37:10.660]   And so to me, it's possible to create art for AI,
[02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:12.980]   but exactly as you're saying
[02:37:12.980 --> 02:37:16.300]   in a deeply socially embedded way.
[02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:17.140]   - Good.
[02:37:17.140 --> 02:37:18.780]   Well, I think we agree,
[02:37:18.780 --> 02:37:20.980]   but let me just highlight the thing
[02:37:20.980 --> 02:37:23.560]   that makes me think that we agree.
[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:26.820]   Which is that I think for people,
[02:37:26.820 --> 02:37:30.900]   for a community to allow themselves
[02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:35.900]   to recognize in a certain kind of creative act,
[02:37:35.900 --> 02:37:37.780]   I'm thinking of Stravinsky here,
[02:37:37.780 --> 02:37:40.260]   but we could think of a chess thing.
[02:37:40.260 --> 02:37:43.300]   To recognize in a certain kind of creative act,
[02:37:43.300 --> 02:37:47.380]   a new and admirable worthy way of thinking
[02:37:47.380 --> 02:37:50.020]   about what's significant in the situation.
[02:37:50.020 --> 02:37:54.300]   You have to believe that it wasn't random.
[02:37:54.300 --> 02:37:58.720]   You have to believe that Stravinsky wrote that way
[02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:03.720]   because he was receptive to what needed to be said now.
[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:06.420]   And so you said,
[02:38:06.420 --> 02:38:11.420]   if only AlphaZero could do all this
[02:38:11.420 --> 02:38:13.900]   by virtue of recognizing
[02:38:13.900 --> 02:38:16.420]   that this was the thing that needed to be done,
[02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:19.580]   then it would be socially embedded in the right way.
[02:38:19.580 --> 02:38:21.580]   And I think I agree with that.
[02:38:21.580 --> 02:38:26.100]   First of all, it's possible to do in a constrained domain,
[02:38:26.100 --> 02:38:29.100]   a game playing domain, Go or chess.
[02:38:29.100 --> 02:38:30.380]   Go is more complicated than chess,
[02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:32.480]   but either one of them,
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:34.900]   because there really are only a finite range
[02:38:34.900 --> 02:38:38.140]   of possibilities if you make the game end
[02:38:38.140 --> 02:38:39.060]   at a certain point.
[02:38:39.060 --> 02:38:43.500]   It's a combinatorial problem in the end.
[02:38:43.500 --> 02:38:48.500]   Now, obviously, AlphaZero doesn't solve the problem
[02:38:48.500 --> 02:38:50.220]   in a combinatorial way.
[02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:53.100]   That would be sort of take too much energy.
[02:38:53.100 --> 02:38:54.140]   You couldn't do it.
[02:38:54.140 --> 02:38:58.780]   It sort of explodes the problem.
[02:38:58.780 --> 02:39:00.900]   So it does it in this other way that's interesting,
[02:39:00.900 --> 02:39:03.420]   this pattern recognition way, roughly.
[02:39:03.420 --> 02:39:06.460]   And in that context, it may well be
[02:39:06.460 --> 02:39:11.460]   that it can see having had lots and lots of experience
[02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:14.580]   in the training stuff against itself
[02:39:14.580 --> 02:39:17.020]   or against another version of itself.
[02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:18.860]   It can see that the sacrifice here
[02:39:18.860 --> 02:39:20.960]   is gonna pay dividends down the road.
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:25.140]   See, I put that in quotation marks.
[02:39:25.140 --> 02:39:30.140]   That's to say it's got a high weight to this move here
[02:39:30.140 --> 02:39:33.060]   as a result of experience in the past
[02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:38.060]   where that move down the line led to this improvement.
[02:39:38.060 --> 02:39:42.260]   So in that finite context, I think,
[02:39:42.260 --> 02:39:44.780]   you know, the game players can trust it.
[02:39:44.780 --> 02:39:46.420]   And they talk that way.
[02:39:46.420 --> 02:39:48.320]   That it's got a kind of authority.
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:53.180]   They say, I've read some people who said about AlphaZero
[02:39:53.180 --> 02:39:58.180]   when it played Go, it's like it's playing from the future.
[02:39:58.420 --> 02:40:03.420]   It's making these moves that are just outlandish.
[02:40:03.420 --> 02:40:06.140]   And there's a kind of brilliance to them
[02:40:06.140 --> 02:40:07.740]   that we can't really understand.
[02:40:07.740 --> 02:40:09.820]   We'll be catching up to it forever.
[02:40:09.820 --> 02:40:13.580]   I think in that context, like it's mapped the domain
[02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:15.020]   and the domain is mappable
[02:40:15.020 --> 02:40:18.140]   'cause it's a combinatorial problem, roughly.
[02:40:18.140 --> 02:40:23.140]   But in something like music or art of a non-finite form,
[02:40:26.420 --> 02:40:31.060]   it feels to me like it's a little harder for me
[02:40:31.060 --> 02:40:34.620]   to understand what the analog of our trusting
[02:40:34.620 --> 02:40:38.780]   that Stravinsky has recognized something about us
[02:40:38.780 --> 02:40:41.180]   that demands that he write this way.
[02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:43.900]   That doesn't seem like a finite thing
[02:40:43.900 --> 02:40:45.220]   in quite the same way.
[02:40:45.220 --> 02:40:47.940]   Now we could ask, we could ask the system,
[02:40:47.940 --> 02:40:48.780]   why did you do it?
[02:40:48.780 --> 02:40:52.180]   We could ask Stravinsky, why did you do it?
[02:40:52.180 --> 02:40:55.360]   And maybe it will have answers.
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:40:59.040]   But then it's involved in a kind of communicative act.
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:02.740]   And I think lots of times artists will often say,
[02:41:02.740 --> 02:41:05.300]   look, I can't communicate better
[02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:07.500]   than what I've done in the piece of work.
[02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:08.700]   That is the statement.
[02:41:08.700 --> 02:41:09.540]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:41:09.540 --> 02:41:13.340]   So yeah, we humans aren't able to answer the why either.
[02:41:13.340 --> 02:41:16.480]   But I do think the question here is,
[02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:20.420]   well, first of all, language is finite.
[02:41:20.420 --> 02:41:23.100]   Certainly when expressed through a tweet.
[02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:25.640]   So it is also a combinatorial problem.
[02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:29.300]   The question is how much more difficult it is than chess.
[02:41:29.300 --> 02:41:34.300]   And I think all the same ways that we see the solutions
[02:41:34.300 --> 02:41:40.200]   to chess is deeply surprising when it was first addressed
[02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:44.240]   with IBM Deep Blue and then with AlphaGo
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:46.800]   and AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero.
[02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:51.360]   I think in that same way, language can be addressed
[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:53.380]   and communication can be addressed.
[02:41:53.380 --> 02:41:56.680]   I don't see, having done this podcast,
[02:41:56.680 --> 02:41:59.700]   many reasons why everything I'm doing,
[02:41:59.700 --> 02:42:02.740]   especially as a digital being on the internet,
[02:42:02.740 --> 02:42:05.360]   can't be done by an AI system eventually.
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:10.840]   So I think we're being very human-centric
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:11.980]   and thinking we're special.
[02:42:11.980 --> 02:42:14.920]   I think one of the hardest things is the physical space.
[02:42:14.920 --> 02:42:19.180]   Actually operating like touch and the magic
[02:42:19.180 --> 02:42:21.820]   of body language and the music of all of that
[02:42:21.820 --> 02:42:23.980]   because it's so deeply integrated
[02:42:23.980 --> 02:42:26.780]   through the long evolutionary process
[02:42:26.780 --> 02:42:29.300]   of what it's like to be on earth.
[02:42:29.300 --> 02:42:34.300]   What is fundamentally different and AI can catch up on
[02:42:34.300 --> 02:42:39.940]   is the way we apply our evolutionary history
[02:42:39.940 --> 02:42:42.340]   on the way we act on the internet,
[02:42:42.340 --> 02:42:43.940]   on the way we act online.
[02:42:43.940 --> 02:42:46.580]   And as more and more of the world becomes digital,
[02:42:46.580 --> 02:42:50.380]   you're now operating in a space where AI
[02:42:50.380 --> 02:42:53.340]   is behind much less so.
[02:42:53.340 --> 02:42:55.140]   Like we're both starting at zero.
[02:42:55.140 --> 02:42:57.660]   - I think that's super interesting.
[02:42:57.660 --> 02:43:01.260]   Do you know this author, Brian Christian?
[02:43:01.260 --> 02:43:02.820]   Is that someone you've ever heard of?
[02:43:02.820 --> 02:43:03.660]   - That sounds familiar.
[02:43:03.660 --> 02:43:07.620]   - He's a guy who competed in the,
[02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:09.420]   what is it called, the Loebner competition?
[02:43:09.420 --> 02:43:10.260]   - The Loebner Prize, yeah.
[02:43:10.260 --> 02:43:11.780]   - Yeah, the Turing test thing.
[02:43:11.780 --> 02:43:14.420]   And I'll just tell you the story,
[02:43:14.420 --> 02:43:17.460]   but I think it's directly related to the last thing you said
[02:43:17.460 --> 02:43:19.980]   about where we're starting in the same place.
[02:43:19.980 --> 02:43:24.300]   He competed in this competition,
[02:43:24.300 --> 02:43:27.300]   but he didn't enter a program
[02:43:27.300 --> 02:43:30.580]   that was supposed to try to pass the Turing test.
[02:43:30.580 --> 02:43:32.500]   The Turing test, there's three people.
[02:43:32.500 --> 02:43:34.500]   There's the judge, there's the program,
[02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:38.380]   and then there's someone who's a human the way they do it.
[02:43:38.380 --> 02:43:41.040]   And the judge has got to figure out by asking questions,
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:43.100]   which is the computer and which is the human.
[02:43:43.100 --> 02:43:45.020]   So little known fact,
[02:43:45.020 --> 02:43:47.340]   there's two prizes in that competition.
[02:43:47.340 --> 02:43:49.820]   There's the most human computer prize.
[02:43:49.820 --> 02:43:51.820]   That's the computer that wins the most.
[02:43:51.820 --> 02:43:54.780]   And then there's the most human human prize.
[02:43:54.780 --> 02:43:57.780]   And he competed for the most human human prize.
[02:43:57.780 --> 02:43:59.740]   And he won it, he kept winning it.
[02:43:59.740 --> 02:44:04.100]   And so he tried to think about what it is
[02:44:04.100 --> 02:44:07.380]   that you have to be able to do
[02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:08.780]   in order to convince judges
[02:44:08.780 --> 02:44:10.980]   that you're human instead of a computer.
[02:44:10.980 --> 02:44:13.500]   And that's an interesting question, I think.
[02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:16.580]   And when he came to,
[02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:19.660]   my takeaway from his version of this story
[02:44:19.660 --> 02:44:23.820]   is that it is true that computers
[02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:26.460]   are winning these contests more and more,
[02:44:26.460 --> 02:44:29.820]   as technology progresses.
[02:44:29.820 --> 02:44:32.620]   But there's two possible explanations for that.
[02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:35.120]   One is that the computers are becoming more human.
[02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:37.980]   And the other is that the humans
[02:44:37.980 --> 02:44:41.460]   are becoming more like computers.
[02:44:41.460 --> 02:44:43.460]   And he says, actually,
[02:44:43.460 --> 02:44:47.660]   the more we live our lives in this world
[02:44:47.660 --> 02:44:50.460]   where in this sort of technological world,
[02:44:50.460 --> 02:44:54.820]   where we have to moderate our behavior
[02:44:54.820 --> 02:44:58.060]   so that it's readable by something
[02:44:58.060 --> 02:45:02.060]   that's effectively a computer,
[02:45:02.060 --> 02:45:04.700]   the more we become like that.
[02:45:04.700 --> 02:45:07.780]   And he says, it happens even when you're
[02:45:07.780 --> 02:45:09.300]   not interacting with a computer.
[02:45:09.300 --> 02:45:11.140]   He says, have you ever been to the,
[02:45:11.140 --> 02:45:14.580]   on the phone with the call center?
[02:45:14.580 --> 02:45:16.380]   And they're going through their script.
[02:45:16.380 --> 02:45:17.940]   And that's what they've got to do.
[02:45:17.940 --> 02:45:19.620]   They've got to go through their script
[02:45:19.620 --> 02:45:21.580]   because that's how they keep their job.
[02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:22.860]   And they ask you this question,
[02:45:22.860 --> 02:45:24.180]   you've got to answer it.
[02:45:24.180 --> 02:45:27.260]   And it's as if you're no longer interacting with a person,
[02:45:27.260 --> 02:45:29.060]   even though it's a person.
[02:45:29.060 --> 02:45:30.820]   Because they've so given up
[02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:33.020]   everything that's involved normally
[02:45:33.020 --> 02:45:36.020]   with being able to make judgments and decisions
[02:45:36.020 --> 02:45:38.740]   and act in situations and take responsibility.
[02:45:38.740 --> 02:45:42.660]   And so I think that's the other side of it.
[02:45:42.660 --> 02:45:46.500]   It is true that technology is amazing
[02:45:46.500 --> 02:45:49.940]   and can solve huge ranges of problems
[02:45:49.940 --> 02:45:52.580]   and do fantastic things.
[02:45:52.580 --> 02:45:56.060]   But it's also true that we're changing ourselves
[02:45:56.060 --> 02:45:57.740]   in response to it.
[02:45:57.740 --> 02:45:59.500]   And the one thing I'm worried about
[02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:01.860]   is that we're changing ourselves
[02:46:01.860 --> 02:46:06.300]   in such a way that the norms for what we're aiming at
[02:46:06.300 --> 02:46:08.500]   are being changed.
[02:46:08.500 --> 02:46:11.420]   To move in the direction of this sort of efficiently
[02:46:11.420 --> 02:46:14.620]   and in an optimized way solving a problem
[02:46:14.620 --> 02:46:17.460]   and move away from this other kind of thing
[02:46:17.460 --> 02:46:21.620]   that we were calling aliveness or significance.
[02:46:21.620 --> 02:46:24.980]   And so that's the other side of the story.
[02:46:24.980 --> 02:46:25.940]   - And that's the worry.
[02:46:25.940 --> 02:46:28.000]   But it's very possible that there is,
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:31.340]   for you and I, the ancient dinosaurs,
[02:46:31.340 --> 02:46:35.820]   we may not see the aliveness in TikTok.
[02:46:35.820 --> 02:46:38.700]   The aliveness in the digital space.
[02:46:38.700 --> 02:46:41.020]   That you see it as us being dragged
[02:46:41.020 --> 02:46:43.700]   into this over-optimized world.
[02:46:43.700 --> 02:46:45.100]   But that may be,
[02:46:45.100 --> 02:46:51.840]   in fact, it is a world that opens up opportunities
[02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:54.780]   to truly experience life.
[02:46:54.780 --> 02:46:56.900]   And there's interesting to think about
[02:46:56.900 --> 02:46:58.940]   all the people growing up now
[02:46:58.940 --> 02:47:02.340]   who their early experience of life
[02:47:02.340 --> 02:47:05.020]   is always mediated through a digital device.
[02:47:05.020 --> 02:47:06.940]   Not always, but more and more often
[02:47:06.940 --> 02:47:08.580]   mediated through that device.
[02:47:08.580 --> 02:47:10.820]   And how we're both evolving.
[02:47:10.820 --> 02:47:13.620]   The technology is evolving, the humans are evolving.
[02:47:13.620 --> 02:47:16.440]   To then maybe open a door to a whole world
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:20.380]   where the humans and the technology or AI systems
[02:47:20.380 --> 02:47:22.780]   are interacting as equals.
[02:47:22.780 --> 02:47:24.060]   - So now I'm gonna agree with you.
[02:47:24.060 --> 02:47:26.660]   You might be surprised that I'm gonna agree with you.
[02:47:26.660 --> 02:47:28.260]   But I think that's exactly right.
[02:47:28.260 --> 02:47:30.980]   I don't wanna be the person who's saying
[02:47:30.980 --> 02:47:34.340]   our job is to resist all of this stuff.
[02:47:34.340 --> 02:47:37.140]   I don't wanna be a Luddite, that's not my goal.
[02:47:37.140 --> 02:47:40.420]   The goal is to point out
[02:47:40.420 --> 02:47:44.460]   that in the supreme danger lies the saving power.
[02:47:44.460 --> 02:47:46.780]   - Yes. (both laughing)
[02:47:46.780 --> 02:47:49.100]   - The point is to get in the right relation
[02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:51.200]   to that understanding of what we are.
[02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:54.420]   That allows us to find the joy in it.
[02:47:54.420 --> 02:47:56.940]   And I think that's a hard thing to do.
[02:47:56.940 --> 02:47:58.500]   It's hard to understand even what we're supposed
[02:47:58.500 --> 02:48:00.220]   to be doing when we do it.
[02:48:00.220 --> 02:48:02.140]   I'm maybe high more than you.
[02:48:02.140 --> 02:48:06.100]   I'm not of the right generation to be able to do that.
[02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:07.620]   But I do think that's gotta be the move.
[02:48:07.620 --> 02:48:09.260]   The move is not to resist it.
[02:48:09.260 --> 02:48:11.220]   It's not a nostalgic move.
[02:48:11.220 --> 02:48:15.920]   It's an attempt to push people to get in the relation to it.
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:18.740]   That's not the relation of it controlling you
[02:48:18.740 --> 02:48:20.500]   and depriving you of stuff.
[02:48:20.500 --> 02:48:22.960]   But of your recognizing some great joy
[02:48:22.960 --> 02:48:24.700]   that can be found in it.
[02:48:24.700 --> 02:48:27.580]   - When I interact with legged robots,
[02:48:27.580 --> 02:48:29.540]   I see there's magic there.
[02:48:29.540 --> 02:48:32.940]   And I just feel like the person who hears the music
[02:48:32.940 --> 02:48:34.020]   when others don't.
[02:48:34.020 --> 02:48:35.500]   And I don't know what that is.
[02:48:35.500 --> 02:48:37.100]   And I'd love to explore that.
[02:48:37.100 --> 02:48:37.940]   - Yeah.
[02:48:37.940 --> 02:48:39.780]   - And because it seems to,
[02:48:39.780 --> 02:48:42.820]   it's almost like the future talking.
[02:48:42.820 --> 02:48:45.180]   And I'm trying to hear what it's saying.
[02:48:45.180 --> 02:48:48.240]   Is this a dangerous world or is this a beautiful world?
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:50.500]   - Well, I can certainly understand
[02:48:50.500 --> 02:48:51.740]   your enthusiasm for that.
[02:48:51.740 --> 02:48:56.180]   Those used to be things that I found overwhelmingly exciting.
[02:48:56.180 --> 02:49:00.440]   And I'm not sort of closed off from that anymore.
[02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:03.900]   I mean, I'm not now closed off from that
[02:49:03.900 --> 02:49:06.000]   even though my views are changed
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:07.960]   and I don't work in that world.
[02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:11.180]   But I do think, I think it's interesting
[02:49:11.180 --> 02:49:14.260]   to figure out what's at the ground of that response.
[02:49:14.260 --> 02:49:15.300]   Yeah.
[02:49:15.300 --> 02:49:19.100]   - We talked about meaning quite a bit throughout
[02:49:19.100 --> 02:49:20.580]   in a secular age.
[02:49:20.580 --> 02:49:22.660]   But let me ask you the big ridiculous question,
[02:49:22.660 --> 02:49:23.860]   almost too big.
[02:49:23.860 --> 02:49:27.860]   What is the meaning of this thing we got going on?
[02:49:27.860 --> 02:49:29.320]   What is the meaning of life?
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:33.980]   - You're saving the softball for the end.
[02:49:33.980 --> 02:49:34.820]   - Easy one.
[02:49:34.820 --> 02:49:35.780]   Easy one.
[02:49:35.780 --> 02:49:37.940]   - I don't know what the meaning of life is.
[02:49:37.940 --> 02:49:41.600]   I think there's something that characterizes us
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:44.380]   that's not the thing that people normally think
[02:49:44.380 --> 02:49:46.540]   characterizes us.
[02:49:46.540 --> 02:49:48.020]   The traditional thing to say
[02:49:48.020 --> 02:49:49.500]   in the philosophical tradition,
[02:49:49.500 --> 02:49:51.260]   even in the AI tradition,
[02:49:51.260 --> 02:49:56.060]   which is a kind of manifestation of philosophy
[02:49:56.060 --> 02:49:57.300]   from Plato forward.
[02:49:57.300 --> 02:49:59.540]   The traditional thing to say is that what characterizes us
[02:49:59.540 --> 02:50:03.540]   is our rationality, that we're intelligent beings,
[02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:06.660]   that we're the ones that think.
[02:50:06.660 --> 02:50:11.060]   And I think that's certainly part of what characterizes us.
[02:50:11.060 --> 02:50:14.860]   But I think there's more to it too.
[02:50:14.860 --> 02:50:19.860]   I think we're capable of experiencing simultaneously
[02:50:19.860 --> 02:50:27.260]   the complete and utter ungroundedness of everything
[02:50:27.260 --> 02:50:29.980]   that's meaningful in our existence,
[02:50:29.980 --> 02:50:34.380]   and also the real significance of it.
[02:50:34.380 --> 02:50:37.900]   And that sounds like a contradiction.
[02:50:37.900 --> 02:50:39.860]   Like how could it really be significant
[02:50:39.860 --> 02:50:41.320]   and not be based on anything?
[02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:43.640]   But I think that's the contradiction
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:45.780]   that somehow characterizes us.
[02:50:45.780 --> 02:50:47.900]   And I think that we're the being
[02:50:47.900 --> 02:50:52.380]   that sort of has to hold that weird mystery before us
[02:50:52.380 --> 02:50:55.580]   and live in the light of it.
[02:50:55.580 --> 02:50:59.180]   That's the thing that I think is really at our core.
[02:50:59.180 --> 02:51:00.460]   And so how do we do that?
[02:51:00.460 --> 02:51:02.220]   I will say this one thing,
[02:51:02.220 --> 02:51:05.100]   and I learned it from a philosopher,
[02:51:05.100 --> 02:51:07.060]   from a guy named Albert Borgman,
[02:51:07.060 --> 02:51:08.900]   who's a German philosopher,
[02:51:08.900 --> 02:51:09.940]   lived in Montana now,
[02:51:09.940 --> 02:51:13.020]   taught in Montana for his whole career.
[02:51:13.020 --> 02:51:16.800]   And I say this to my students at Harvard now,
[02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:19.860]   he said, "This is the way that I think about my life,
[02:51:19.860 --> 02:51:22.700]   "and I hope you'll think about your life too."
[02:51:22.700 --> 02:51:24.860]   He said, "You should think about your life
[02:51:24.860 --> 02:51:31.200]   "hoping that there will be many moments in it
[02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:33.340]   "about which you can say,
[02:51:33.340 --> 02:51:36.020]   "there's no place I'd rather be,
[02:51:36.020 --> 02:51:40.300]   "there's no thing I'd rather be doing,
[02:51:41.540 --> 02:51:44.320]   "there's nobody I'd rather be with,
[02:51:44.320 --> 02:51:47.660]   "and this I will remember well."
[02:51:47.660 --> 02:51:52.160]   And I think if you can aim to fill your life
[02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:54.420]   with moments like that, it will be a meaningful one.
[02:51:54.420 --> 02:51:56.820]   I don't know if that's the meaning of life,
[02:51:56.820 --> 02:51:59.300]   but I think if you can hold that before you,
[02:51:59.300 --> 02:52:01.820]   it'll help to clarify this mystery
[02:52:01.820 --> 02:52:04.180]   and this sort of bizarre situation
[02:52:04.180 --> 02:52:05.540]   in which we find ourselves.
[02:52:05.540 --> 02:52:09.040]   - Sean, this conversation was incredible,
[02:52:09.040 --> 02:52:11.020]   and those four requirements
[02:52:11.020 --> 02:52:13.680]   have certainly been fulfilled for me.
[02:52:13.680 --> 02:52:17.420]   This was a magical moment in that way,
[02:52:17.420 --> 02:52:18.980]   and I will remember it well.
[02:52:18.980 --> 02:52:19.980]   Thank you so much.
[02:52:19.980 --> 02:52:22.780]   It's an honor that you spend your valuable time with me.
[02:52:22.780 --> 02:52:24.180]   This was great, thank you.
[02:52:24.180 --> 02:52:25.420]   - Thank you for having me, Lex.
[02:52:25.420 --> 02:52:27.560]   I really, really enjoyed it.
[02:52:27.560 --> 02:52:29.200]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:30.400]   with Sean Kelly.

[02:52:36.660 --> 02:52:38.060]   from Albert Camus.
[02:52:38.900 --> 02:52:40.460]   In the depth of winter,
[02:52:40.460 --> 02:52:43.140]   I finally learned that within me,
[02:52:43.140 --> 02:52:45.400]   there lay an invincible summer.
[02:52:45.400 --> 02:52:47.300]   Thank you for listening,
[02:52:47.300 --> 02:52:49.060]   and hope to see you next time.
