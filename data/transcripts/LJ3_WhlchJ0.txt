[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Welcome back on this new week. Starting today, we have a bundle of apologetics questions lined up on the person and work of Christ.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Next time, we look at several answers to the question, "Why did Jesus leave earth after Easter?"
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   I mean, imagine if Christ was still here with us. Well, He's not. Why not? That will be APJ 1978.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Then a week from now, the question, "Why didn't Jesus have to pay eternally for our sins? Isn't that the price? Eternal judgment.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   So why is His suffering done?" That will be APJ 1979 on the 25th of this month.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   And then comes the question, "Why don't we have more archaeological or historically written evidence for the death and resurrection of Christ?"
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   That will be APJ 1981, our first episode in October. A lot of ground to cover until then.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   We start with today's question because even if the Christian faith is untrue, if the cross and resurrection didn't happen,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   aren't Christians still happier than non-Christians in this life?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Don't our present life priorities make for a more fulfilling experience of this life than the non-Christians seeking their joy in this world, even if we are wrong?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   It's a question from Chip, a listener from Georgia.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Pastor John, hello to you.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Christian hedonism seems to say that our deepest longings in this life can only be satisfied in God, and it's only in Him that we can be truly happy.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   If God makes us happier than people who simply pursue the world, why does Paul say that we are to be pitied most of all men if there is no resurrection?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   He says that in 1 Corinthians 15, 19. Even if Christ was not resurrected, isn't our life now more satisfying than the life of the non-Christian?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I'm smiling real big. I love sharp, biblically-rooted questions.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Yes.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I've asked this. In fact, I've spoken on it. Years ago, I spoke to the Wycliffe folks in Cameroon on this very question.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   So I was trying to remember what I said.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   It is a really important and good question rooted in 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   So let me just bring Chip up and the rest of us to where I'm thinking today.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I don't know that I have the completely satisfying answer, but I have some answers that have helped me.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Just a clarification to start with about Christian joy in this painful life.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   A huge part of our joy as Christians is what Paul calls rejoicing in hope from Romans 5.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   In other words, joy is not complete in what we can know and have of God here now.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Our joy is in hope of what we will know and have of God in the future also.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Our joy here is a foretaste of the fullness of joy there.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And so it's not complete now.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   We see through a glass darkly and we know in parts.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Our joy is in part.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   It's strong now. It's deep now.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   It's enough to carry the day now, but it's nothing near like what it will be.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So Romans 5, 2 says, "Through him we have obtained access by faith into the grace in which we stand,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   That means that the joy we anticipate in the age to come flows back into this age in measure,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   but not in fullness, but in measure.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   "We rejoice in our sufferings," he says, "knowing that our suffering produces endurance,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   and endurance produces character, and character produces hope."
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   So we are people who have this strange emotional experience of rejoicing in what we don't yet have to make us happy.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   So I don't want to overstate the joy of the Christian hedonist in this age.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   It is not nearly what it will be in the age to come, and much of it is anticipatory now.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   So here are the key words that create the problem in 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   The context is Paul's talking about whether Christ has been raised from the dead or not.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   He says, "If Christ has not been raised from the dead," this is verse 14 following,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   "if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   We are even found to be misrepresenting," that is, we're false witnesses of God, liars about God,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   "because we have testified about God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   if it is true that the dead are not raised."
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And then verse 17, "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile, you are still in your sins,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished,"
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   we're going to come back to that, that's really crucial,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   "Christians have gone to hell, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   they've gone to hell, if in Christ we have hope only in this life,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   we are of all people most to be pitied."
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And the question is, how can Christians who have more joy than anybody else be most to be pitied?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   That's the question. And I'm asking, why'd you say that, Paul?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And here are the, I think I see four reasons for why Paul says this.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Number one, evidently Paul believes that delusion, a life of delusion is to be pitied,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   even if it's a happy delusion.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   It's not just that we are experiencing in this,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   what we're experiencing in this life proves to be more or less happy in the other,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   it proves to be non-existent in the other.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   If Christ is not raised from the dead, then my joy in the living Christ is not joy in the living Christ.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   There is no living Christ.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And therefore I am not experiencing joy in the living Christ.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I am an absolute idiot. I'm a fool.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Paul's first conviction, it seems to me, is that this is not true.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Christ is raised.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And his second conviction is that it's a delusion if he's not raised,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   and it's an enormous delusion, more pitiable than anything he could think of, evidently.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So that's the first reason.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   A delusory life, a life lived in absolute delusion is to be pitied.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Number two, Paul's life would be pitiable
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   because he willingly embraced so much suffering that he could have avoided.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Those sufferings were sustained by Paul's joy in Christ, not the other way around.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   The sufferings didn't create the joy in this life.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   So if there's no resurrection, those sufferings were absolutely pointless.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   That's the second one.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Number three, we deny ourselves many pleasures here
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   precisely for the sake of the reward of the age to come.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   So Jesus said, "Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Rejoice and be glad now, for your reward is great in heaven."
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   So we renounce retaliation and the joy of getting back at people.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   We renounce that.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   We renounce the comforts of fitting into the world
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   so that we don't ever have to be criticized or reviled.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   We renounce that. Why?
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Precisely because we believe it will be made up to us in heaven,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   which means we didn't just fail to maximize the pleasures we could have had here,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   but we bargained that the self-denial would be rewarded in the resurrection,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   and there is no resurrection, and the bargain failed.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And here's the fourth and last reason I think he said this.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   This one comes straight out of his words.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   If Christ and we are not raised from the dead,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   then Paul doesn't infer atheism.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   He infers hell, that we enter a worse punishment in hell than others
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   because we didn't just make a mistake.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   We actively misrepresented God.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Oftentimes I've read this chapter and this argument as though,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   "Well, if there's no resurrection from the dead,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   the whole biblical religion is false.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   There is no God.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Caesar, Osiris, he, June can be married."
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   That is not what Paul does.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   He didn't argue like that.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   He says, "If Christ has not been raised, God's going to send me to hell
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   because I've been telling everybody that this is his son,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   and he's been raised from the dead, and I am a false prophet.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   And therefore, I am, of all people, most to be pitied
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   for I'm going to get the worst punishment."
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   So in sum, I would sum it up.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Here they are.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   If there is no risen Christ, no resurrection of believers
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   unto eternal reward and joy,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   then number one, Christian life is a delusion.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Number two, voluntary suffering is painfully pointless.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Number three, hope in heaven is futile,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   and all of our basing our self-denials on it was ridiculous.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   And number four, any attempt to speak for the living Christ
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   would be a damnable scam and a false prophecy
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   which would deserve hell even more than others,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   and we would perish under that severe sentence.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   So we are, of all people, most to be pitied.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Man, sobering.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   A text that all assumes Paul's hypothetical here.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   What if God is real, but the resurrection isn't?
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   It's a fascinating way to see 1 Corinthians 15,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   not talking about atheism at all,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   but in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   That's the glory of 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   and he is our true joy now in any hope of eternal happiness.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   It all rides on Christ and his defeat of the grave and this fact.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   If you want to ask Pastor John, type out your question as briefly as possible
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   and email it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Speaking of Easter, next up, why did Jesus have to ascend and leave us?
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Couldn't he have just continued his ministry on earth even up until now?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   The answer? No.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Pastor John will explain why not next time.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I'm your host Tony Renke. We'll see you back here on Thursday.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   [end]
