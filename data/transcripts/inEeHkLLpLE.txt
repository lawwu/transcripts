[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   All right, let's do another call, Jesse.
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.240]   I like these.
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.240]   All right, we got a call about smartwatches.
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.240]   Hello, Cal.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.040]   My name is Connor Beck.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.000]   I am a copywriter and content marketing specialist from St. Paul, Minnesota.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.160]   And my question has to do with smartwatch technology.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.360]   So I think I know what your answer to this question might be, but I'll ask it anyways.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.240]   I just wanted to get your general thoughts on smartwatches.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.720]   I really try and not stay glued to my phone or get too distracted throughout the day,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.680]   but I thought maybe I could use a smartwatch in a very simplified way in order to screen
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.080]   out text messages that are not important versus those that are.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.720]   My partner occasionally texts me throughout the day, and sometimes it is very time-sensitive
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.120]   and important in terms of what she texts me about.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.280]   So again, I think I might know your answer, but I'm just wondering what you think of smartwatch
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.480]   technology and if that technology can be used in a very simplified way so that it actually
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.160]   helps you eliminate distraction rather than create more distraction, and if you can use
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:16.000]   that technology in a way that allows you to tune out distractions rather than be overcome
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   by them.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.240]   So thanks again for your insight and your wisdom.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.200]   It is very much appreciated.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.040]   Thank you to both you and Jesse for sharing the deep life, and keep up the good work.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.040]   Thank you.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.920]   >> Connor, with smartwatches, we should separate two different common uses.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.960]   So there's productivity.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.840]   That's the category where we'll put what you are talking about now.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.960]   So looking at text messages and emails, being able to communicate through your watch for
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.600]   productivity purposes.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.160]   Then there's fitness, which is a whole other world, which I'll put aside for now.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.280]   So in the productivity world, as you seem to be guessing, no, I'm not that impressed
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.460]   by the idea of needing a smartwatch to make you more productive.
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.360]   I think you should be spending less time with notifications, not more.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.480]   I don't buy the screening argument.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.340]   So there's two possible responses here.
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.040]   One is what would happen if, and this is the way I typically run things, I check my phone
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.100]   sometimes.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:29.320]   And so text messages that come in when I don't have my phone with me, I won't see for a while.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.680]   The right answer to that question is nothing bad will happen.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.200]   And you can come up with a lot of scenarios where, well, so my partner is literally on
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   fire.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.320]   And if I don't get the text message in time, I can't use this app I have set up to trigger
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.100]   a complex Rube Goldberg style watering system that will put out our flames.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.680]   You can come up with these scenarios, but here's the thing.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.340]   Well, just about a minute ago, we did not have the ability to contact people like that.
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.440]   And very few people burn to death because their partners couldn't access to Rube Goldberg
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.440]   watering system.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.840]   So we were fine without that before.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.320]   I think most people would be fine today.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.460]   It's easy to come up with those scenarios, but they just don't happen enough.
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.460]   They don't happen enough.
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:17.000]   And when they do happen, the cost is such that it's not worth months and months of consistent
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.280]   distraction because every four months, you missed a call that caused someone to get mad
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.280]   at you.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.280]   I say fair trade.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.640]   All right.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.840]   Number two, I would say about that is, okay, if you really are worried about it because
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.400]   your partner spends a lot of time around fire and you spent a long time building that Rube
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.360]   Goldberg apparatus, then just do the extra five minutes of work to set up the filter
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.440]   on your phone so that for calls, you have a white list and people on that list, their
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.200]   call comes through, put their number on it, put your ringer on.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   All right.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.600]   Call here if there's really an emergency.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.840]   Now, this comes up a lot.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.680]   I talked about this in my book, A World Without Email, where this was the context of business
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.400]   where you're making yourself less accessible.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.600]   And we called it the steam valve.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.800]   You have the emergency steam valve where you say, okay, I know I'm not going to be as accessible
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.360]   on email or Slack or whatever, whatever the plan is you're talking about, but don't worry.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.960]   We have an emergency backup.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.600]   Call this phone number.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.320]   So there's always a way you can reach me.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.720]   There is no actual period where you can't reach me.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.360]   And the whole point of those backup emergency steam valves, we called it, strategies, was
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.740]   not so that you could avert emergencies because they never happen.
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.200]   You talk to people who set up, like, okay, here's my special number.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.680]   Call me if you can't wait until, like, the next time I'm supposed to be online or my
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.100]   office hours or whatever.
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.520]   No one ever calls.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.080]   The emergencies don't happen.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.180]   They exist just so that people feel better.
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.920]   They know if they really had to reach you, they could.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.000]   And I always thought that was an interesting observation is that we're worried that all
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   these emergencies are happening.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.280]   They rarely do.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.880]   The potential existence of these specters should not be sufficient to get you to live
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.160]   all of your time in a much more distracted state.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.720]   So there's a question like, what watts do I use?
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.160]   As Jesse will attest, I actually hang off of my belt an old fashioned sand hourglass.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160]   That's true, Jesse?
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.160]   It's true.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.760]   And I, and I, so I have a sundial I consult.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.000]   And so when the shadow gets to the top of an hour, I flip over the hourglass.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.280]   It weighs about seven pounds.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.640]   It's about yay big, but you know, it's simple.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.040]   You don't run out of batteries with your sand.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.040]   Am I right, Jesse?
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:43.240]   No, actually I will say, um, the watch I use is, is like the, my favorite, my favorite
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.800]   physical object that I own.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.920]   So I'm not in the cars.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.280]   I don't dress very well or collect a lot of things, but I do.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.420]   My watch is like very symbolic to me.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.540]   It is something I really enjoy.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:02.840]   So I use a, uh, let's say down here and a mega speedmaster, early analog winded every
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.320]   day with a little, uh, mechanism.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.960]   It's mechanism is brilliantly engineered.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.600]   They updated this in 2021.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.200]   It loses, you know, a second in it per day or something.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.320]   So it's just like beautiful engineering inside of this thing.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.480]   No batteries, no electricity, no quartz crystals, no text messages being shown through.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.880]   And the backstory I like about this other than being like a nice, like well engineered
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.160]   piece of analog handicraft is that this was the watch that was approved by NASA for the
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.400]   Apollo missions.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.680]   Speedmaster went into space and you can get a lot of pictures of the astronauts.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.720]   They actually wore it on the moon.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.880]   They would, they got bigger straps that could go around the outside of the UVA suits.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.360]   But I liked it as a metaphor to this that I think is nice for the type of techno criticism
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:55.960]   I do, which is when Apollo 13 was having their famed troubles on the way to the moon, they
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.680]   had to shut down all the computers to save battery power, right?
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.920]   So they shut down all the computers.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.120]   So they're just, this thing was just flying analog and they had to do these burns of the
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:12.240]   engine to correct their trajectory so that they want to skip off the atmosphere of the
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.240]   earth.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.880]   They had to do these precise burns, but the computers were shut down.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.480]   And so how did they do them?
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:24.400]   Well, they had a reticule, like a little cross hairs, which they aimed at a very particular,
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.060]   you know, I think it was the horizon, the terminal horizon on the moon.
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.860]   And then a level timed it with the speed master.
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.820]   So this analog piece of beautifully engineered gears, when all the electricity had to be
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.500]   turned off, essentially it was this piece of analog handicraft that actually that plus
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:47.260]   a cross hairs plus fire is how the astronauts did what otherwise a computer would do.
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.120]   So this is a nice metaphor about the, you know, beauty and analog simplicity versus
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.940]   the complexities and distraction of the digital.
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:01.980]   So I can use that all to justify otherwise a sort of kind of absurdly expensive thing
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.700]   to wear on your wrist.
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:15.460]   [MUSIC]
