[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.760]   Today we talk real estate, more real estate.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.400]   We're going to have to rename radical personal finance to be radical real estate pretty soon
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.400]   here.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.560]   We also talk, however, life insurance, how to protect spouse and kids with group life
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:51.160]   insurance and we talk a little bit about, again, where and how to save money for long-term
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.160]   goals.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:10.360]   So we have some real gems in here today, I hope you enjoy.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.320]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.720]   This is the show where I work hard to equip you with the ideas and inspiration you need
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:27.160]   to live a rich life now and also to build a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.160]   less.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:42.440]   Today you're going to hear some ideas on how to do both of those things.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.960]   I've been switching our Friday Q&A calls to be a Live Friday Q&A call.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.120]   And a quick note about that here as I begin, I really am enjoying this.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.840]   I like the personal interaction.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.440]   I enjoyed it very much a few months ago when I did it and I like it.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.120]   I do warn you, I am still learning.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.360]   It's a completely new skill set to figure out how to balance the appropriate length
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.800]   of an answer and how to stay on point.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.200]   So frankly, I did my best but I was just thinking back a little bit after the fact about some
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.560]   of the answers and I did my best.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.840]   But I intentionally often leave my best here for you without going back and editing it
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.200]   tightly sometimes simply because I want to lead by example.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.160]   Anytime you're acquiring a new skill, you're going to find yourself in a situation probably
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.120]   where you're not very good for a while.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.000]   They talk about the stages of competence, right?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.860]   If memory is right, you start with unconscious incompetence and then you move to conscious
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.680]   incompetence.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.400]   Then you move on to conscious competence and then finally perhaps to unconscious competence.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.760]   But right now with these Friday Q&A shows, I feel like I'm in the stage of conscious
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.000]   incompetence at the moment.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   So bear with me.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Stick with it.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.400]   Feel free to use that forward button on your phone.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.520]   That's the beauty of podcasting.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.900]   If I run a little longer, I'm not able to do a perfect job.
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.600]   But I do try to leave these breadcrumbs here.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.820]   And again, those of you who've listened to the show from the beginning, I am confident
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.440]   that I have measurably improved and increased in ability over time.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.620]   And I've tried to leave those breadcrumbs here to encourage you in your endeavors.
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.960]   Don't expect to be good at things when you start.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.280]   I've heard it said anything worth doing is worth doing poorly at first.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.080]   You're not going to be good at things when you start even when I'm not good.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.200]   But what we can do is we can continue to get better as we focus on developing the skills.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.020]   So I think five or ten years from now, you tune into a Friday Q&A show if I'm still doing
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.180]   them in that format, and they'll be smooth.
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.180]   They'll be articulate.
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.220]   They'll be precise.
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.940]   But they're not totally there yet.
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.980]   But I'm working there.
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.220]   So as you're listening to today's show, my hope is you'll find some good ideas.
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.620]   But also watch what I'm doing and how I'm doing it because I believe it's a good model
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.700]   that all of us can apply.
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.980]   Before I hit play on the interview for you, a couple quick announcements.
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.700]   Number one, sponsor of today's show is YNAB.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.700]   You need a budget.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.340]   This is the personal budgeting software that I use.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.340]   And they've just recently made some measurable improvements.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.180]   If you have tried YNAB in the past and didn't like it, the biggest complaint that I've heard
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.220]   in the past about YNAB is in the past, they didn't automatically import transactions.
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.980]   Personally, I find that to be a benefit because then I'm forced to manually enter the transactions
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.140]   which raises my level of consciousness around my spending.
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.140]   But if you don't need that level of consciousness and if you have a lot of transactions, it
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.860]   can be a little bit annoying, totally recognize that.
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.620]   So in the latest version and update of YNAB, they have completely fixed that and now you
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.300]   can set up automatic import.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.380]   And I think that's the best way to do it because you can set up the automatic import or if
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.980]   you still want to have the pain of entering in your spending transactions, you can force
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.140]   that pain onto yourself by doing it manually.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.380]   YNAB is the budgeting software that I use to budget my business software and my personal
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.300]   software every single day.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.820]   I'm in the app multiple times a week.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.940]   So I commend it to you.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.820]   It's the best solution I found for budgeting my family's money.

[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.020]   Quick announcement as well, I have been participating in the online investing conference.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.980]   That conference, the early bird registration has now ended.
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.540]   Hopefully many of you took advantage of that.
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.860]   However, the late registration is still available and I would recommend to you if you have any
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.620]   interest in finding out about some of really the world's – some of the world's leading
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.340]   commentators on investment opportunities in 2016, if you have interest and want to hear
[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.940]   their insight on some of the major opportunities that might be available in this year for your
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:01.940]   investments, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/OIC which is an acronym for Online Investing Conference,
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.860]   Online Investing Conference.
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.100]   You get free access to introductory videos where you can find out the gist of what they're
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.620]   talking about and then if you decide the conference is right for you, feel free to sign up there.
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.380]   Finally, I'm about to play the Q&A but I intend to offer these Q&A calls just about
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.860]   weekly and they will be offered to patrons in the future.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.220]   At the end of this recording, you'll hear me kind of quibble a little bit and it's
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.220]   just very raw.
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.780]   I'm not editing it but you'll hear me just talk about the patron program.
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.180]   You'll hear my answers and I've made a few missteps on the patron program but I'm
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.920]   focused on trying to improve it consistently.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.140]   One of the ways that I do want to do that is I will be continuing to do these Q&A calls.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.500]   If you would like to have a question answered on the show in this format, I would recommend
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.820]   to you that you sign up to become a patron and that way you'll get access to the day
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.060]   and time and phone number for this call and you'll be able to join and access the call
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.060]   as a patron.
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.420]   I have a long queue of emails that I get from listeners and subscribers, plenty of questions
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.420]   that I could answer.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:08.440]   I just have too many to answer and so this is one way of me prioritizing the answers
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.440]   for the patrons of the show.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:16.160]   So if you'd like to participate with a question or a comment or on anything you like, please
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.860]   consider becoming a patron of the show.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:23.340]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron and you will then gain access to the Q&A show
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.340]   information.
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.740]   Great, welcome to the Q&A call today guys.
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.180]   I'm looking forward to speaking with you all.
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.460]   Just real quick, very simple, I'll let you kick us off with a question.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.460]   Feel free to talk about anything that you'd like to talk about.
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.140]   We'll talk and we'll have a little bit of back and forth if you have questions, comments,
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.340]   but I'm happy to hear your input.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.540]   So let's start with Scott in Indianapolis.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.740]   Scott, go ahead and ask your question.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.140]   Well, thanks a lot, Joshua.
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:57.180]   I have a question about, a two-part question about liability umbrella insurance.
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:03.260]   I think a lot of us radicals kind of have a handle on what type and how much life insurance
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:10.100]   or disability insurance, but in terms of umbrella insurance, I'm kind of in the dark.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.140]   There are two schools of thought that I've read about.
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:20.740]   One is yes, umbrella insurance is good in the event of damages that exceed your homeowner's
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:27.420]   and automobile insurance, but the flip side, completely 180 degree from that is no, you
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:33.380]   don't want umbrella insurance because that will make you an easier target for a damaged
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.380]   payout.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:40.580]   So my first part of the question is, is it good, bad, or does it depend on the individual
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.580]   situation?
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:48.380]   And the second part is how much umbrella liability insurance do you need if you determine that
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.060]   you do need some?
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.060]   This is a fun one.
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.020]   I've also read those different perspectives.
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.340]   It's an area where I'm weak on in terms of practical experience.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.740]   I've looked for, tried to find somebody who would be an expert on this area to bring on
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.740]   for an interview.
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:11.900]   And in fact, if there's anybody listening to this podcast who is an expert on this topic,
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.580]   who'd like to talk about it, I'd love to have you on the show.
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.260]   Just email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com, and I'd be happy to bring you on and discuss
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.260]   it.
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:25.300]   But I was taught – so I've never sold liability insurance nor have I worked extensively
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.660]   in that marketplace beyond just what I did to pass the CFP exam and beyond the basic
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.620]   certified financial planner recommendations.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:38.420]   So the basic rule I was taught though, my instructor in preparing for the CFP exam,
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:53.380]   he said, "If you ever see liability insurance as an option on the test, make sure that you
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:58.860]   go ahead and check that because it's going to be right."
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:04.140]   The rule that they taught was liability insurance, umbrella liability insurance is always a good
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.180]   idea.
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.580]   So I have no differing opinion to that.
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:18.480]   I think the whole easier target thing, I don't know.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.500]   It doesn't make sense to me that – I'm speechless because I just don't know the
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.500]   answer.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.180]   I don't think that prudent protection is going to make you a target.
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.100]   I think that probably more of the other things that you do in your life are going to make
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.100]   you a target.
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:38.580]   I think you can minimize that risk is to simply focus on living a less flashy lifestyle.
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:44.340]   So for me, I always have been into the concept of never let people know how much money you
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.980]   have, never let people know how much you're worth, and I think that most wealthy people
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.860]   live their lives that same way.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.120]   Now obviously, you live in a certain zip code, you live in a certain type of house.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.140]   People are going to make assumptions about that.
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:01.940]   I don't think that having insurance is going to make the difference.
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.100]   If someone can present to me evidence to the contrary, I'd love to see it and I'll
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.260]   change my opinion, but I've never seen evidence for that.
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:18.540]   As far as how much, it's generally so cheap, I don't see any reason not to protect – essentially,
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.260]   I don't see any reason not to protect most of your assets or especially at least not
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.540]   most of the assets that aren't protected by some other mechanism.
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.100]   I know that's kind of fuzzy, but that's just been – if I had $5 million net worth,
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:37.380]   having a $5 million umbrella liability policy to me just seems like a decent place to start.
[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:42.500]   I don't know anything more specific than that and rather than me go on and on, I'll
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.500]   just repeat what I said.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.620]   If there's an expert in this area, I have a few friends who deal here in Palm Beach
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.900]   and like the high net worth market that maybe I'll reach out to them personally and see
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.900]   if they'd like to come on and talk about it and I'll see if I can get you a better
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.020]   answer in the future, but that's all I got, Scott, unfortunately.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.100]   That's fine, Joshua.
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.020]   That's pretty much my assessment as well.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:09.660]   I picked up an extra $1 million umbrella insurance policy about a year and a half ago and it's
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.340]   only like $100 a year.
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:19.500]   It's really cheap and the extra $100 doesn't really move the needle in terms of our cash
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.500]   flow statement.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.500]   So yeah, thanks for your time.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.500]   That helps.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.700]   The only other thing I do know that you want to make sure of and most of the time the insurance
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:33.780]   agent will do this for you, but make sure that your coverages are lined up properly.
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:39.700]   So if on your homeowner's insurance you have a liability limit of let's just say $500,000,
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:46.180]   you want to make sure that your umbrella policy is picking up at $500,000 and it's going
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.620]   from $500,000 to $1.5 million.
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.940]   You want to make sure that it's not kicking in at a million dollars.
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.540]   You don't want there to be a gap between the coverages.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:03.180]   So if you line those things up properly, then there'll be a good interplay between the home
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.460]   and your car and the umbrella policies.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.060]   I think it's the big thing I've learned to look out for on liability insurance.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:15.580]   If you can find an expert liability insurance agent, I think it's really, really valuable
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:21.180]   to have because there can be a lot of little things that you want someone to go through.
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.820]   This is again where my friend who specializes in working with high net worth families here
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.660]   in Palm Beach, he'll talk about going through and recognizing, "Oh, okay, we've got the
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.660]   jet skis on the yacht."
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.620]   Well, you've got to make sure that those are covered because you don't want to have a loophole
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:39.140]   where one of the teenagers was riding the jet ski that was on the yacht, there was no
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:44.260]   insurance policy in force, and now there was an accident of some kind and you're found
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.260]   liable.
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.580]   You've got to make sure that everything is covered.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.320]   So I think in addition to the umbrella policy, it's important to have somebody just talk
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.340]   through all the little risks, make sure that all the vehicles, that the ATVs are covered,
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.540]   that the shed, the structures are covered, just all of the little things.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:02.340]   I think that's also important in approaching liability insurance.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.340]   So that's the best I got.
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.020]   Again, I welcome any readers or listeners who have better opinions.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.340]   Joshua at RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:14.340]   Let's go next and I'll let you guys choose who would like to go next.
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:20.480]   I wouldn't mind going next, Josh.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.480]   Go ahead.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:27.200]   Yes, I actually have a bunch more questions after listening to that answer about insurance,
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.200]   but I'll leave those for another day.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:37.840]   My question I was calling about was just about a simple life insurance purchase through my
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.120]   W-2 job.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:45.740]   My wife has recently decided to stay at home and leave her job and on the re-…
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:52.500]   You have to stay with our two kids at home, but when redoing my benefits, I kind of was
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:57.000]   looking through the different options I had again and I can elect to change some of those.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.680]   And one that I had never considered before was spouse life insurance or child life insurance.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.080]   I always just skipped over them thinking she was either covered or financially.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.440]   I didn't think there was a…
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.960]   If we lost a child, I didn't know financially how that would impact us.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.320]   So I always skipped over those ones, but I was looking at the prices of them and it seems
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.440]   to go up in $10,000 increments for about 37…
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.720]   Or I guess it's like 18 or 19 cents per week if you cost it out.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:33.480]   So that comes to about $480 a year for $500,000 of insurance or like the last caller said,
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.960]   it's just under $100 a year for $100,000 of insurance.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:42.040]   And hearing him makes me think, "Okay, that lines up price-wise with other things, which
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.040]   is good."
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.720]   But I'm just kind of curious about the overall thought process of how to decide whether I
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.360]   should go for this or not.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:54.720]   I'm more inclined to skip it still, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.720]   anything.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.720]   My answer to the question is it's going to depend on the numbers and there are a couple
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.940]   different steps to the thinking process.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.200]   The first thing you have to ask yourself and let's separate the question of spouse versus
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.820]   kids and answer them separately because they're very different approaches.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.920]   So the first question when you're thinking about, "Does my stay-at-home wife, does
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.760]   she need insurance coverage?"
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.700]   My answer is yes, she does.
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.000]   So hopefully most people will agree.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.840]   The only exception would be if you're financially independent and you don't need it and I'd
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.640]   still probably buy it.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:33.340]   If my wife is a stay-at-home mom and if she died, I mean, I don't know what I'd do.
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.580]   I don't know how I'd build.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:39.660]   I would have no possibility of continuing the plan going forward and being able to take
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.600]   care of our children in the way that we've dreamed.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:48.480]   So there's no question about my having as much life insurance on her as I can get.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.340]   So let's start with yes, she needs life insurance.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.060]   Next you got to figure out how much.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:17:02.020]   Now when you have somebody who is a wage earner, then you can calculate their economic contribution
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.860]   to the household and you can calculate the economic needs.
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.380]   It's relatively simple.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.660]   The best way is you do a needs analysis and you figure out how much money they're bringing
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.780]   into the household and you can figure out the appropriate amount of life insurance or
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.940]   you can just simply say, "I want to replace their salary."
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:24.860]   When you have a stay-at-home spouse, it's a lot more difficult because I can't prove
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:29.740]   in my family, I can't prove what the economic value is of my wife.
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.500]   I'll tell you, it is huge.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.100]   It's massive.
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.300]   She's far more valuable to our family than any amount of money that she could earn out
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.580]   in the workforce.
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.420]   So that's what I'm trying to protect.
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.460]   Now it gets a little bit fuzzy as to figure out what's an appropriate amount of life insurance
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:53.500]   and the only thing I've ever been able to figure out to do is to say, "Get at least
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:59.140]   half of what the wage-earning spouse has in insurance coverage."
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.540]   You could probably go through and figure out, "Well, how much would I need to buy these
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.040]   certain services?"
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.420]   But it's just such an unknown.
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:09.700]   Even though I like precision, I've never been able to get to that level of precision.
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:15.620]   And so when I used to sell insurance, if the husband was going to buy $2 million, I'd
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.180]   get at least $1 million for a stay-at-home spouse.
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:22.020]   If the husband needed $1.5 million, I'd try to get $750 or $1 million for the stay-at-home
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.020]   spouse.
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:28.000]   I have about $2.5 million of insurance on me and my wife has $1 million on her.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.860]   So it's similar ratios.
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.140]   That's the best I can get to with the amount.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.860]   Then you got to decide, "Well, what's the best way to do it?
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.660]   Is it best to do it through your job or is it best to do it independently?"
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:46.500]   The answer is it's always best to do it independently unless you can get just some crazy screaming
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.180]   deal through your job.
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:55.580]   You want it independently because you don't want her ability to have life insurance to
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.140]   be connected to your job.
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:03.180]   Imagine the scenario where you lose your job and you're staying at home now and she's caring
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.980]   for you and then all of a sudden she dies during that time.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.940]   Not only did you lose your life insurance, but you lost her life insurance as well.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:19.620]   I always want to have the appropriate amount of life insurance that we can get in an individually
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.860]   owned life insurance policy.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:25.860]   It's probably going to be a term life insurance policy, or at least for the majority of it,
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.940]   because you have a temporary need when your kids are younger and you have a temporary
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:35.860]   need, that 20-year time span, so that's a great fit for a term policy.
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:41.300]   You want to get it with that individual term policy so it's not connected to your job.
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:46.740]   Now, once you've got that in place, you go back and look at the insurance at your job
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.980]   and you say, "Is this a good deal?"
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.540]   Here's where it can be a little bit fuzzy.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:58.500]   Let's say that you've got $2 million of insurance on you and you got a million-dollar life insurance
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:05.380]   policy on your wife as a separate term policy that you own personally, and then you're looking
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:11.820]   at your group benefits and you can see that she can get $350,000 for just pennies.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:18.820]   Take that number that they quote you on the benefits statement and compare it to what
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.580]   you're paying for term insurance.
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.380]   Sometimes it'll be more, sometimes it'll be less.
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:30.740]   If it's substantially less, if it's cheap, maybe I'm biased because I'm formerly an insurance
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:36.160]   agent, but if it's super cheap, I would usually just add it on because I feel good having
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.700]   a little bit of extra money, especially knowing that sometimes with some insurance companies,
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.460]   you can't quite qualify for as much as you'd like.
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:47.700]   Frankly, I'd like to have a little bit more insurance on my wife and I haven't really
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.420]   applied for it, but I do know from having been an insurance agent that right now, if
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.540]   we were to go and apply for more life insurance for her, we couldn't economically justify
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.820]   it based upon the internal underwriting guidelines.
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:04.220]   So if I had the opportunity to pick up a few extra $100,000 at my job for a couple of bucks
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:08.700]   here and there and it's substantially below the open market rates, I would do it, but
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.180]   it's not a precise answer.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:15.700]   Now if you don't have the insurance in place individually, then definitely yes, get it
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:22.540]   at the job and also if you can't get a good rate on insurance individually, let's say
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:28.500]   your wife is sick or is unhealthy in some way and she's being quoted too high of a rate,
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:33.140]   well then it's very compelling to step in and get the insurance coverage at her job.
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:39.820]   So it's a matter of running the numbers and comparing what premiums you're quoted at your
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.580]   job versus the premiums in the open market.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.980]   Have you done any of that analysis yet?
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:49.100]   No, actually I haven't done anything at all.
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:56.100]   In fact, outside of just the free insurance, we get the hidden cost insurance that we don't
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:01.140]   pay for through my job and her job that are just some multiples of our salary that are
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.180]   paid for by the companies.
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:07.820]   We don't have really any life insurance at all and I know it's a big gaping hole for
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:11.060]   the whole avoid catastrophe part of it.
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:17.380]   We have been passing on it just because we keep thinking off the cuff, okay, if one of
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:23.060]   us dies, we can still get by, but obviously there's going to be impact and it was just
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.060]   a matter of is it a catastrophic impact?
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:32.100]   I mean, obviously beyond losing the spouse or whatever, but financially it's like, well,
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.940]   the answer was always, yeah, we see a way that we could get by without it, but obviously
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.540]   things would be a lot easier if we did have it.
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:44.020]   So we just, being ignorant, we just kind of pass on it rather than buy it without knowing
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:50.300]   what to buy or how to analyze it or even simple things like what's a screaming deal considered?
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:57.340]   I only had one data point, which was the deal from work and now after hearing what you said,
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:02.380]   maybe I should have got independent insurance while she was, or before she quits work even
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:07.060]   maybe, but they probably have rules about how long after that you can quit.
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.180]   Yeah, I haven't run the numbers on anything.
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.180]   Okay.
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.620]   So about what age is your wife?
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.460]   Sorry, I went back on mute.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.420]   She is 30, she's 34.
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.420]   Okay.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:26.100]   So a 34 year old female, healthy non-smoker, you could buy a million dollars of term life
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:31.580]   insurance, annual renewable term insurance, which probably gut instinct here, I would
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.220]   say probably in about the $35 to $40 a month range.
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:39.740]   So that's about $400 a year, something like that.
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.520]   So and you can run some numbers.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.420]   In fact, what I'm going to do, I'm going to hit pause just a moment here and I'm going
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.700]   to run a quick quote so we use real numbers.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:48.700]   Okay.
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:55.140]   So I just ran some rates here and to answer this question a little bit better and the
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.220]   website that I use, I won't link it in the show notes, I'll just simply say it here in
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:03.380]   the audio, but I use a website that I've mentioned on the show before called thestamagency.com.
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:08.820]   T-H-E-S-T-A-M-M-A-G-E-N-C-Y.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:12.260]   And the reason I'm not linking it in the show notes is because this is a website that's
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.260]   for brokers.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:19.300]   I've interviewed, it's my friend, Todd Simpson, he's been on the show before.
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:29.260]   This is the agency that he runs and they do, they have on this website term insurance rates
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.420]   that you can run if you want to run term insurance.
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.580]   And so there's no sales funnel.
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:37.660]   This isn't like all of the terminsurance.com and all the gazillion options that exist there.
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.620]   There's no sign up to contact agents.
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.940]   If you're just trying to get an idea of how much insurance is going to cost for you, you
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.940]   can use this.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.460]   There's no follow-up funnel for you.
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:54.100]   So a 10-year level term insurance policy for a million dollars for a 35-year-old female
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:25:00.220]   in the state of Florida, preferred best non-tobacco here, we're talking an annual premium of $230
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.740]   for 10 years level term.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:08.000]   That's with protective, MetLife 230, Banner Life 240, and Principal 250.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.260]   Now preferred best is a little bit tough to get, but let's just start with that.
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.940]   And that's why I say you got to actually get some real numbers.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.580]   Or if you wanted to stretch it out to, let's get 15-year, and let's just look at 20-year
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:23.900]   term here, level 20-year term insurance, protective life for a 35-year-old female, a million bucks
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.760]   is $371 a year level for 20 years.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:33.260]   So we're actually talking even for level term there, we're talking less.
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.680]   This website doesn't quote annual renewable terms, so it doesn't do it well anyway.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.700]   So I can't quote you those prices.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.360]   Let's just stick with level term.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:47.580]   So we're basically talking about $25 to $40 a month.
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:55.020]   You can get, again, 20-year level term insurance for $380 a year for 20 years.
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:59.020]   So when I look at those numbers and I compare them to the financial scale that most of us
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:03.940]   are dealing with, those numbers are insignificant.
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.060]   It's not going to make or break somebody.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:12.020]   You obviously have to, each individual listener, obviously have to check your budget and see
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.500]   is this $30 a month, is this going to make or break me?
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.500]   Is this going to make a big difference?
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:20.380]   And you might need a little bit less, you might need to figure something else out.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:24.340]   But when I look at that, I just say in the grand scheme of things, that's not a big deal,
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:31.180]   especially as compared to the peace of mind that I get knowing that I have a lot of insurance
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.180]   in place.
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:37.580]   Because I'll tell you what, if my wife passed away, my business would be closed down, it
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:41.580]   would take me a long time to figure out what to do.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.160]   And the insurance would make a big difference.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.380]   So you could compare those numbers, got a little off track there, but you could compare
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:53.620]   those numbers to what you're being offered at your job.
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:58.580]   Now it's not going to be a direct comparison because what you're offered at your job is
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:03.420]   actually a yearly renewable term policy bundled within a group contract.
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.420]   So it's not directly comparable.
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:11.100]   But if Protective Life is saying they'll offer you a contract for $230 a year for 10 years
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:17.140]   level for a million bucks and you go at your job and you find out that instead of $230
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:23.340]   a year, it's going to be $400 a year, well then there's no reason for ... I wouldn't
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.820]   get the group insurance in that place.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.940]   I'd go buy the level term contract out in the open market.
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.740]   Now if on the other hand, you get in there and you say, "Well, it's a hundred bucks a
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:34.540]   year," now you know you're getting a good deal and go ahead and buy it there at your
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.860]   group contract.
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:40.920]   So that's how I would answer the question of insurance for your wife who's a stay at
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.180]   home mom and do that.
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:48.140]   Now let's switch to the kids because it's a different conversation.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:52.980]   With regard to insurance for kids, there are a few different schools of thought.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:59.560]   One school of thought is make sure that you have just enough money to bury the kids.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.780]   Another school of thought, if something happens and you've got to pay for a funeral, that
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.020]   can be an unexpected expense, so therefore you want to make sure that you cover that
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.500]   with insurance.
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.500]   That's one school of thought.
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.960]   Another school of thought is just don't bother with insurance.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.320]   It's unlikely to happen.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.620]   It's not really going to be a big deal.
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.260]   Another school of thought is to buy a lot of life insurance because of the money that
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.260]   you're investing into your kids.
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:27.940]   And then there are other variations of it.
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:34.900]   Personally, I believe it's very valuable to have insurance for your kids.
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.420]   I own life insurance policies on both of my children.
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:43.700]   When it comes to how to do it, the challenge is that you cannot buy term life insurance
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:48.100]   for kids in the open market, or at least if you can, I've never found out where and how
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.100]   to do it.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.340]   If any listener can show me where and how, I'll be happy to spread that information.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:57.900]   I've never found a place to buy a term life insurance policy for my kids in the open market.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:03.220]   The only place I've seen those policies offered is as bundled with a group contract, just
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.100]   like you have the option there at your job.
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:10.020]   The cool thing about those term policies that are offered there as a group contract is they're
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.020]   really, really cheap.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:15.140]   Now, there's not going to be that much insurance, but they're pretty cheap.
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:20.660]   And so it's just a matter of saying, "Is it going to be 19 cents a month?
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.780]   Well, if so, then I'll go ahead and do it just in case.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:27.860]   If it's going to be five bucks a month, I don't know."
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:33.280]   You have to run the risk of it, and you could compare the amount of the insurance versus
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.860]   the amount of the benefit.
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.860]   I usually just told people sign up for it because usually those group contracts, they're
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.780]   very, very inexpensive.
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:46.340]   The statistical likelihood of your children dying at a young age is tiny, but you'd be
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.580]   glad to have it if it happened.
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:54.900]   What I have done is purchased small whole life insurance policies for my kids because
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:59.940]   to me, the biggest value of those is the ability to buy additional amounts of insurance in
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.140]   the future.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:07.180]   So I have $25,000 whole life policies on each of my kids, and the policies are carefully
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:13.260]   designed so that they have maximum growth and death benefit, minimum premium payments
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.800]   due with a good quality insurance company.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.100]   And then also they have a couple of riders on them, and they have two riders that to
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.100]   me are very important.
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.940]   They have one is a waiver of premium rider where if the child ever gets sick or disabled,
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.220]   the premiums are waived on the contract.
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:33.620]   And they also have an additional purchase benefit rider where those small $25,000 policies
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:38.040]   actually have a total of just under about a million bucks of additional purchases that
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.180]   are available.
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:45.500]   So if for some reason my kids got sick or hurt in the future, they would not be able
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:50.980]   to and they couldn't get more insurance, then at least in that situation, we could go ahead
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:55.880]   and buy more insurance under the contract that they have, even if they couldn't medically
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:00.500]   qualify for it or if they couldn't occupationally qualify for it because one of them has started
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.260]   racing cars in NASCAR or something like that.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.660]   So to me, that's important.
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.820]   Many people feel strongly differently about it.
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:11.460]   You buy them at age zero, they're about $20, $25 a month.
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:16.160]   And cash accumulation in kids' policies is very slow.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.060]   It's a really bad rate of return in the very beginning.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:24.000]   It's really, really bad because of the costs of insurance when you start that little.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.380]   But you will at some point recoup the money if you cash them out.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:31.880]   Their whole life policies, they'll go paid up in somewhere between 10 and 20 years.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.460]   So I just like them.
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:39.940]   I think it's flexible and I'm willing to – that small amount of money is small enough that
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:44.700]   it's not – I don't ever view it as something that is going to make my family rich, but
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.500]   I like having it as a backstop.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:50.980]   And it makes me feel good knowing that if something happened and one of my kids died,
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:56.120]   there would be enough money there to do – probably to do something in their honor.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:00.380]   And yes, we have other savings accounts and emergency funds and things like that that
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:04.660]   we wouldn't have to go to a life insurance policy, but I like having a life insurance
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:05.660]   policy.
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:10.540]   It's one of those where I can't give you a hard and fast rule, but that's how we've
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:11.540]   approached it.
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:13.780]   Any follow-up questions on that?
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:19.180]   No, that's really helpful to hear how you think through that and all the details on
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.980]   the policy for the kids.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:21.980]   Thank you very much.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:30.060]   The only limitation I might have on the spouse insurance through my work is I think – if
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:36.380]   I'm not mistaken, it does cap out at $500,000, so I may – I know you're talking on the
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:41.940]   orders of multiples of millions, one or above, so that might be the other factor that pushes
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:46.500]   me out into the open market even if it was a better deal than the open market.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.660]   So yeah, thank you very much.
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.660]   It's all very helpful.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.660]   You're welcome.
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.180]   I consider a million bucks to basically be the minimal insurance policy that I'd ever
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.740]   even bother with, and the reason for it is a couple of things.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:02.540]   For most people, the cost – and again, we're talking mass market, the majority of listeners
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:07.500]   listening to this show, middle market, median income, upper median income, a million bucks
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:12.460]   of insurance is on the range of 20 to 40 bucks a month for most people, and that's just
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.780]   not a lot of money.
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:20.260]   Saving – going to $13 a month instead of $19 a month in order to get 500,000 instead
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.480]   of a million, OK, fine.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.580]   You can do it, but I've never bothered with that little amounts.
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:32.060]   Number two is a million dollars of insurance today is really useful.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:36.060]   Twenty years from now, figure out what that million dollars would be worth.
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.140]   Let's do some quick math here.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:45.260]   Let's punch a million bucks into a calculator as a present value, and present value, let's
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:57.700]   say 20 years, let's run this in as a 3% annual inflation, no payments, and let's
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.060]   see what that'll be worth in 20 years.
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:06.380]   So in 20 years, a million dollars of insurance is going to be worth $543,794, the equivalent
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.780]   in today's dollars if we have a 3% inflation rate.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:15.460]   So when you're buying a term policy like this, a 20-year term policy, you got to factor
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.300]   that in as well.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:23.640]   So I just basically think a million bucks is the minimum unit, and if someone wants
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.060]   to get half a million, fine.
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:28.300]   It doesn't work in my head, but that's up to you.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:32.460]   Run the numbers, and what you'll see is – quick comment that might be interesting
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.140]   to some people.
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:40.220]   The way insurance is priced, it's generally with most companies, most insurance policies,
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:46.340]   there are exceptions, but it's completely linear, but there's a policy fee in the
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.340]   insurance.
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:48.340]   What I mean by it's linear.
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:53.780]   So if I'm looking at this 10-year term $100,000 contract that's on the screen in front
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.220]   of me, that's $230 a year.
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:35:03.100]   If we were to increase that to $2 million, it would basically be about double except
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.940]   for the policy fee.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.380]   So usually an insurance contract will have a policy fee.
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:13.320]   It could be anywhere from $50 to $100 a year, and that policy fee is how the insurance company
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:18.420]   calculates the cost of maintaining the contract, the cost of sending out the annual notices,
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.820]   the cost of all of those things.
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.800]   So let's say it's a $50 policy fee.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:29.780]   So what that means is if the contract is $230 minus a $50 policy fee, the cost of insurance
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:33.660]   is $180, and that number is linear.
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:37.020]   So if we wanted to figure out if those were the real numbers, if we wanted to figure out
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:42.660]   the exact additional cost, we would take the $230, pull out the $50 policy fee, which equals
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:48.900]   $180, and that's $180 for a million units, a million dollars of insurance.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:54.420]   Multiply that number times two, it would be 360, and then we would add the $50 back in.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.660]   So that would be $410.
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:01.260]   So the cost for a $2 million policy would be $410, and the cost for a $1 million policy
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.340]   would be $230.
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.020]   That's how insurance is priced.
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.300]   That's how it works.
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:11.740]   So when you get down to the very minimal numbers, $150, and you know you're going to have a
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:18.980]   built-in $50, $75, $100, $90 policy fee, and that's in every contract, there's no reason
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:24.740]   not to increase the amount of insurance to the point where the policy fee is a negligible
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.340]   amount of the premium.
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:31.340]   That's another reason why I just assume we're starting at a million bucks.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:35.940]   This other little tip I would say is I would always choose a higher amount of insurance
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:40.620]   in a shorter term if I had to.
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:45.140]   If I'm trying to figure out a budget, I'd rather have a $2 million – and you got to
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:49.200]   actually look at your situation, but in general, a good rule of thumb, have more insurance
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:55.360]   for a lesser amount of time so that you have more coverage in the beginning in case something
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.360]   happens then.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.460]   That's just a little thing that I lean towards as well.
[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.460]   All right.
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.460]   Last question.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.460]   Who wants to go next?
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.460]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.460]   Is it okay if I go?
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.460]   Go for it.
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.460]   I'm sorry, Brandon.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.460]   Thank you again, Joshua, for everything.
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.460]   I just wanted to say I love your podcast.
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:09.460]   I have a question.
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.460]   Basically, my wife, at her work, she's been contributing about $15,000 a year in our
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:13.460]   fourth review.
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:20.460]   Lately, I've been looking at our overall finances and I'm wondering if you could
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:31.460]   share with us what you're looking at right now.
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.140]   I'm looking at our overall finances and it just seems like the way we have it right
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:37.180]   now, we have about $450,000 in our combined retirement account.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.180]   Some of that is Roth.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.260]   Some of that is traditional IRA.
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:43.740]   Then we also have almost $100,000 in cash.
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:49.980]   Whenever I run the numbers, it just seems like that just will be very excessive in our
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:55.380]   moderate payments that we're basically living off of.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.580]   We live fairly frugally despite having three kids.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:03.220]   Probably our expenses are, without the mortgage, it's about $38,000 a year.
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:09.980]   It just seems like if I project out what we have already tied up in our retirement accounts,
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:15.900]   that it just, to keep squirreling away in there, just doesn't seem to make sense rather
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:20.820]   than we have other priorities like maybe buying an investment house to basically diversify
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:26.980]   a bit there or rather than putting 529 accounts that are just dedicated to our kids, having
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:32.980]   something more flexible and also maybe having some money as a dry cotter or just save for
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:37.180]   a potential business for me since I'm going to leave my work soon.
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:42.620]   With all that in mind, my wife tried to basically stop contributing as much into her fourth
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:47.500]   rebate, but the investment advisor at her work, because she's at a nonprofit, he was
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:51.700]   kind of trying to talk her out of it and saying that he's never heard of anybody regretting
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.140]   putting too much into their 403B.
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.380]   I don't think he's seen our finances yet, but I'm meeting with him tomorrow.
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:01.580]   I just want to know where he might be coming from.
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:04.700]   I just want to make sure my wife is comfortable with the whole conversation too.
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:11.340]   Even though I am, just your thoughts on that and what we need to consider and any other
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.660]   opinion on it.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:16.820]   Mad Fientist: Probably what would be the most helpful response is let me tell you what the
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.940]   job of most financial advisors is.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:25.940]   This is where people get frustrated with the term "financial advisor."
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:29.740]   In general, so she's working at a 403B, what type of nonprofit institution is she
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:30.740]   working at?
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:34.140]   David Keefer: She's a nurse, so she works at a hospital.
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:42.260]   I guess the banking advisors, they basically take care of the fund there.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.900]   Mad Fientist: Okay.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.940]   The type of conversation that most financial advisors have with people is really, really
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:54.800]   boring and it's primarily based around trying to encourage people to save money.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.620]   If you look at the statistics and look at the data, the majority of people simply don't
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:59.620]   save.
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.620]   They don't save much.
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:04.060]   They don't save much at all.
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:08.780]   We who are financial advisors, we've been trained to try to get people to save money
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:13.060]   and to try to get people to squirrel away as much as possible.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:17.440]   The entire industry lives and breathes that.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.620]   Is it for nefarious purposes?
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.580]   Well, there's a little bit of self-interest in it.
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:26.980]   The advisor is getting paid probably in a position like that where they're working
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:29.540]   with the nurses in a 403B program.
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:34.540]   They're partly probably getting paid maybe some salary or some base compensation and
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.900]   then partly some type of performance-based compensation.
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:41.080]   So there's a little bit of self-interest.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.420]   Maybe that has an influence.
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:48.940]   I mean I've certainly been under that influence where you want people to fund your accounts.
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.940]   This is often a criticism of financial advisors.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:56.120]   If you're managing money and you're getting paid based upon how much money is in the account,
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.300]   you want to manage as much money as possible.
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:02.760]   I think that is a legitimate potential conflict of interest.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.700]   But my guess is more than that.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:09.180]   It's just simply that we feel like it's the right thing to do.
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.660]   It's basically the crusade.
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:15.300]   It's the gospel that we preach to say you've got to save money because most people don't.
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:21.260]   So you've got an advisor who is spending all day every day meeting with people who are
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:29.060]   saving $5,000 into their accounts, who have account balances of $50,000 and they're accustomed
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.280]   to speaking to people in that circumstance.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.820]   The type of family who is a young family with three children who has a half a million dollar
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:43.980]   net worth who's putting $15,000 per year into a 403B, you are in the top few percent of
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:48.660]   people in the United States in terms of wealth accumulation, assets, and financial planning.
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:54.300]   So this is not a normal situation that that financial advisor is facing.
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:58.500]   The next thing that you've got to pay attention to is that most people who are advisors in
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:01.660]   that type of capacity are not financial planners.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:08.060]   They are, well, depending on how cynical you want to be, we'll just say they're financial
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.460]   advisors, they're account advisors.
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:15.900]   You could perhaps be so cynical as to say they're commissioned salespeople.
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.060]   That certainly can be the case.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:22.940]   Most of the people I've met personally, they're not bad people.
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.700]   They're not trying to do anything nefarious.
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.580]   It's just the job that they've taken.
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:30.820]   So you're not dealing with someone as a representative of an account like that.
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:34.980]   You're not dealing with somebody who is a comprehensive financial planner who specializes
[00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:39.340]   in going out and helping people build out their whole financial plan.
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:47.660]   Most people who are financial advisors, who are with various firms, who are even, well,
[00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:51.820]   if they at least have a CFP certification, they probably can do a financial plan because
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.020]   they're required to do one to do that.
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:56.860]   But most people whose business card says financial advisor, they can't run a financial calculator.
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.420]   They can't build a plan.
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:04.980]   So you can ask them some questions, but I guess all that we would say would be that
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:08.900]   your best way to work with somebody in that capacity is not to ask financial planning
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:13.140]   questions but to ask specific plan-related questions.
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:16.380]   They'll be an expert at answering, "Here are the investment options that we feature in
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.420]   this plan."
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:22.900]   They'll be an expert at sharing with you what the fees are in the plan or how the accounts
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.740]   work or the different options or the matching.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:30.420]   Those are the type of questions that that type of financial advisor can work with.
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:33.900]   So they really have never heard of anybody putting too much money into retirement because
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:39.820]   – I've never heard of anybody putting too much money into retirement really because
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:45.020]   we're not – the modern, I guess, financial independence culture that we're developing
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:50.220]   is not – this is not mainstream financial thought.
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:54.740]   So all that to say, I guess my answer to it is I wouldn't expect too much from that
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.980]   type of financial advisor.
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:01.620]   I've given presentations to rooms of financial advisors.
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.260]   I'll give the best example.
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:09.420]   In this little niche that I'm a part of, an 800-pound gorilla website like Mr. Money
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.220]   Mustache is very well known.
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:17.740]   I gave a presentation about savings rates to a room full of financial advisors, seasoned,
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:23.100]   experienced financial advisors, and I put Money Mustache's website up on the screen
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.940]   and I asked how many of them knew of it.
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:26.940]   Almost nobody had heard of it.
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:29.500]   I think there was one person in the room who had heard of it.
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:34.700]   So you've got to recognize there's a major disconnect in conversation between mainstream
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:39.200]   financial advice versus this niche, early retirement, aggressive savings, financial
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:44.140]   independence, people taking control of their lives and control of their financial futures,
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:45.940]   and they speak different languages.
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:51.380]   That's why I'm here to try to translate the two over.
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:54.820]   You want to ask a more specific question than that or is that, I guess, a place to start?
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.900]   No, that's a good place to start.
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:02.220]   I guess I'm coming from it too is that I think I've heard you talk about when you
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:07.620]   started your business, you had kind of – it was kind of hard to get some of that liquid
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:13.220]   capital and I perceive myself being in that situation maybe in a year or two.
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.180]   And so I think that's part of it.
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:19.580]   So I don't know if you wanted to speak to that or I don't remember if that was specifically
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:23.260]   with your down payment of your house only or whether that was also your retirement account
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:26.220]   that you were referring to or I don't know if you could speak to that.
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:27.220]   Sure.
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:32.500]   In hindsight, knowing what I now know, if I were to do it all over again, for me, and
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.740]   I'm emphasizing the for me because I have an entrepreneurial bent, because I know what
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:42.580]   I want because I'm moving in that direction, I probably would never have even contributed
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:47.300]   to tax-deferred accounts in the first place.
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.420]   I always contributed to Roth IRAs.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.380]   I did have some pension plans but I always contributed to Roth IRAs.
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:56.740]   I didn't spend a long time in the corporate environment where I was contributing to a
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:58.260]   401(k).
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.580]   And so would I have still funded the Roth IRAs?
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:01.580]   Maybe.
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:05.740]   But I guess in hindsight, I would have put a lot less money behind bars and I would have
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:09.260]   kept a lot more where I could touch it and where I could use it.
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.580]   So that's my answer.
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:17.140]   Now for you, I'll tell you, if you are planning on leaving a job, if you are planning on building
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:22.260]   up a side business or something like that, I don't believe you'll regret having cash
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:24.260]   available.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:28.180]   There's no reason to go crazy and start cashing out retirement accounts.
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:29.180]   I'm not there.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.180]   A lot of people are.
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.180]   I'm not there.
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:36.740]   But I do think that you'll find the capital much more useful when it's sitting in a bank
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:38.700]   account and you have access to it.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.140]   It'll bring you more safety in your business.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.660]   It'll bring you more cushion.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:48.060]   It'll bring you more peace and it'll give you more options and more ideas.
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:55.500]   And it was interesting in the patron, the regular Facebook group, there were several
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:47:01.700]   listeners who commented that after my sharing on last week's show about just the limitations
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:08.580]   of money and retirement accounts, that they had made similar choices.
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:13.340]   I try to speak very clearly and honestly and truthfully and transparently about what I
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:16.220]   believe and why and just leave things where they are.
[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:21.740]   I tell you, I even feel like it's hard because I go against the orthodox of most of the mainstream
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:23.440]   financial planning profession.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:28.340]   But after seeing it at this point, I kind of feel like I was – I guess I was – I
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:35.120]   feel like I – I don't know if I was misled or what, but I just feel like the whole mainstream
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.700]   financial advice industry is not working well for most people.
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.800]   Most people are not becoming wealthy.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.720]   When I look at who is wealthy, it has nothing to do with the 401(k)s.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:48.640]   And so I've made the steps and the decisions to walk away and to adjust things going forward.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.780]   Check back in 10 years and I'll tell you how things are going.
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:58.320]   But so far, they're going well and if you have a plan of starting a business, yes.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.080]   Diminish things at least just down to the match.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.340]   I'd take the matching dollars probably if they still offer the match.
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:04.440]   Diminish things down.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.260]   Do pay attention to your tax planning.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.260]   Run your tax brackets.
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:08.260]   I don't want to be foolish.
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:09.940]   I want to run some numbers.
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:13.120]   If you're in a situation where you have too high incomes and you can shelter some of the
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:17.500]   money there temporarily over the next couple of years, you need to take those things into
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:21.380]   account because you can save at your highest marginal tax bracket.
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:27.000]   If you're going to go to a low income situation in the future, so do some good planning.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:34.080]   But roundabout way of saying, I'm not too worried about diminishing retirement contributions.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:36.200]   Let's run a quick math just to see.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.240]   Ballpark, how old are you guys?
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.240]   37.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.240]   Okay.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:48.160]   So let's just say, is the money that's in the 401(k) and retirement accounts, is that
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.280]   money generally intended for traditional retirement age opportunities?
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:55.200]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.080]   I think because she's going to get a pension basically.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:04.360]   She has basically, you could consider her pension vested at like 7,000 right now.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.480]   She loves her job, so she's going to continue working for another, I don't know, it could
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.480]   be another 20 years.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:12.960]   And then if she does that, then she gets 20% of her salary.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.760]   So she could get like $23,000 a year from that if that continues, which seems likely
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.720]   to me, but you never know.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:23.360]   So the only thing guaranteed is I think we have about 7,000, well, it's not guaranteed,
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.560]   but 7,000 that she's vested in her pension.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:30.440]   And if I quit my job today, I think I've run the calculation on Social Security that I
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.720]   would get in about 11,000 a year.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.720]   And her, maybe about the same, but if she quit, but she's probably going to continue
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.980]   working, so probably closer to 30.
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:42.360]   And so that by itself could pay for our living expenses in retirement.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:49.080]   So it's kind of a fail-safe to even have the retirement account as it is now.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.040]   But yeah, so I don't know if that answered your question.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:57.080]   So let's punch this into a calculator, $450,000 present value.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.800]   Let's just say 25 years, that would take you up to 62.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:04.760]   So $450,000 present value, 25 years.
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:09.160]   Let's say you get, let's go with the, what rate of return would you feel comfortable
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.680]   using on this projection?
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:17.600]   I don't know, kind of a 5.9, I guess, you know, around there.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:22.640]   So let's use a 6% annual rate of return, net of taxes, net of fees.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:27.960]   That's $1.9 million would be the projected value of that account at 62.
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:34.640]   So you can project that and you can say, do I feel that that would be adequate given my
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.640]   other sources?
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:39.560]   Do I feel that that would be adequate where I'm not taking a huge risk by going ahead
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.960]   and diverting my attention elsewhere?
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:48.800]   I mean a $2 million account under relatively conservative assumptions there, $2 million
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.320]   account is nothing to sneeze at.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:55.320]   So you'll have to take it beyond that with your own individual personal financial planning.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.520]   It's more than I can do on the call here.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.520]   But I would look at that and I would say 37 years old, half a million bucks.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:04.200]   If you've got some other uses for the money, I say go for it.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.800]   That would be how I would handle it.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:06.800]   All right, next question.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   Hi.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.800]   It's Brandon.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   Let's go with Brandon.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.800]   Let's, yeah, Brandon, you go first and then the other one.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:12.800]   Okay.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:13.800]   I just have a quick question.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:26.040]   Going back to real estate a little bit, in your experience in going to that Schwab conference,
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:31.080]   what are the general terms that you get with someone when you're doing like a private financing
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.080]   deal?
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:35.480]   Like you're going to finance a house that you're going to buy or vice versa.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:37.760]   What sort of terms do you see with that?
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:40.400]   You mean specific numbers or dollar amounts?
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.400]   Yeah, like, yeah, specific like rates of interest and specific time limit.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:48.240]   Do you see like people doing 30 year loans or 10 year loans?
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.040]   I don't know what the industry average is.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:56.560]   What would be a good starting point to negotiate?
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:59.660]   I can't answer the generalized question.
[00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:04.760]   One thing that Schwab makes a point of, and he has replaced this rule, but in the past
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:09.600]   talked about don't pay anything more than 10% interest rate.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:13.920]   And so the only place that you could get a real general answer to that question would
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.940]   be if you were working with somebody like a professional hard money lender.
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:22.800]   And I think like here in my local area, I got a friend of mine who is lending money
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.080]   out right now in that capacity.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:30.240]   I think he said he's lending money at 12% right now.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:35.280]   So that tend to – I would guess if you were to do a survey of hard money lenders there
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:40.840]   in your area, you're probably in that 9, 10, 11, 12% range is what they're looking
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.440]   for to lend you money under those terms.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:53.360]   My guess would be that if Schwab were answering that question, he would – the answer would
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:57.080]   not be to focus on the general number, but it would be to put together the deal that
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:58.080]   works.
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:03.200]   So what he makes a point of and I think is good is you find the solution – you find
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:06.960]   what somebody wants and needs and you put together a deal that works.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:12.880]   So let's say that we were talking – he gave a few examples that he's done.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:18.520]   But let's say that you have somebody who's working as a dentist or a doctor or some other
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:24.400]   high-income profession and you go to them with a deal and they would like to buy real
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.400]   estate but they don't have the time to buy real estate.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.400]   They're busy.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:30.120]   They don't have the time to be out knocking on doors.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.600]   So you can go to somebody like that and you can write up a partnership agreement if you
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.600]   find the deal and you find the property and they may fund the whole thing and you just
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.320]   simply split the profits on the back end.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:44.840]   You don't have to pay any stated interest rate currently.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:49.440]   Or there would be a number of different ways to put a deal together.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:53.040]   So I think the better answer to the question rather than focusing on general terms is to
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.720]   say, "What is the interest that somebody has?
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.000]   Does somebody need current income?"
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.240]   If you have somebody like a hard money lender, they're usually focused on the current return
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:10.720]   from that asset and they're going to be looking for a current rate of return, a current
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.720]   income.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:16.200]   But if you can finance it with somebody who doesn't necessarily need that current income,
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.640]   you can maybe work out a different type of deal.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:23.680]   So I could go to people here in my area and if I wanted to put together deals and have
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:28.320]   people use their 401(k) money to invest in my real estate company and I could put together
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:32.340]   some contracts that to them, they would lend me money and let's say I offer – if I were
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:38.920]   to go out today and offer a guaranteed seven, six or seven percent rate of return to somebody
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:44.360]   for money in their 401(k), current income payment secured by local real estate, there
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:48.680]   would be a lot of people who after the frustrations of a volatile stock market, there would be
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.840]   a lot of people who would take that deal.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:55.120]   So I would say it's more a matter of looking as with any negotiation, trying to figure
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:59.320]   out what are the interests of the other person and how can I put together a deal that's
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:03.760]   going to solve their interests in a way that's best for all of us, not about what are the
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:04.760]   exact terms.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.760]   Right.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:06.760]   So maybe I was confused.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:12.120]   So if I wanted to buy a house as a rental that someone's selling, instead of going
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:16.600]   to the person that's selling the house and kind of coming up with a deal with them and
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:20.040]   saying, "Hey, I'll give you 10 percent down if you'll finance the rest on these
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:27.160]   terms," you're actually using someone else's money like portfolio as a middleman
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:28.160]   in that process.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.160]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:32.560]   There would be a number of different ways and probably what would be the best is maybe
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:38.960]   I should get Shah back on and maybe collect some real estate questions and talk him through.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:43.120]   But it's all going to depend on the individual scenario.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:47.800]   What you're looking for when you're looking for owner financing is usually trying to solve
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.840]   somebody's problem for them.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:53.360]   And so many times what you're looking for is a house that's empty but that has debt
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.280]   on it would be ideal.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:00.240]   And what you're trying to do is to take the house off of their hands and maybe just assume
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.760]   their mortgage.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.840]   That would be one scenario that can work really well.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:09.640]   Now some mortgages have a clause in them that they're not assumable, but even though that's
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:14.580]   the case, at least Shah taught in the class and we talked about, practically you can still
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:19.640]   do it even knowing that that's a risk because practically the banks are not going to cause
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:20.880]   any problems.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:28.120]   So if you have a seller who is just underwater and they need some relief on their payments,
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:34.240]   then you can take over the house subject to their existing loans.
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:38.680]   So it's not about all doing it with investors.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:44.000]   It's a matter of finding a situation where you can solve somebody's problem based upon
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.080]   whatever debt is on the house.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.080]   Probably – go ahead.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:53.760]   Well, I guess from a seller's point of view, I own two properties and just thinking about
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:57.680]   it for our own personal situation, it makes sense that we're ever going to sell either
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:03.240]   of those properties as long as we don't need the capital for any other business venture
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:08.440]   to own or finance it to whoever buys it and collect the payment plus the interest for
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:10.120]   the next 20 or 30 years.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.120]   Does that make sense?
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:12.120]   Exactly.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:17.560]   And that's one of the primary areas that John Schaub encouraged the students to look for
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:24.640]   is if you're looking for a property, one great place for you to find houses is to buy
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.480]   them from a retiring investor.
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:31.280]   And the retiring investor, that deal will work exactly.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:35.920]   I know a couple of local real estate investors here in my area, mid-60s, same type of thing.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.040]   They're wanting to slow down and pull back and they just want to get rid of some of their
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:45.160]   properties and they are very comfortable selling their properties on terms to you or to me.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:48.720]   They would be very comfortable doing that because they know if something happens, they
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.040]   can just go ahead and either renegotiate the deal or take the house back.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.240]   It solves a problem for them.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.840]   It gives them income for retirement.
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.440]   It solves a problem for me.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.840]   It's a win-win across the board.
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:01.240]   Yeah, and it takes their liability away from having to do maintenance on the house.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:05.680]   They essentially get to keep renting it for a certain amount of time for a certain profit.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:06.680]   Exactly.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:07.680]   Okay, thanks.
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.520]   My other question was, what are your plans with the Patreon campaign?
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.480]   Are you ready to disclose that yet?
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:17.560]   Yeah, I'll go ahead and I'll just talk about it here.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.960]   I've been struggling with it.
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:20.960]   This show is going out on Friday.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:25.120]   I've only released two shows this week and it's been a difficult last couple of weeks
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.200]   for me to try to figure out what's the next step?
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:37.160]   How do I take things forward with radical personal finance?
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:42.120]   Things have worked well, but I've reached the limits of my capacity and I've got to
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:49.120]   build the organization behind me, but knowing how to do that is a challenge in this space.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:54.000]   I really want to build more value in the Patreon campaign, but what I've discovered is that
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:00.940]   even just basically managing additional things, I keep dropping the ball as far as managing
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:02.240]   the things that I want to manage.
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:06.920]   The only thing I've successfully been able to continually do is keep the shows coming
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:10.920]   out, but what's happened is I haven't been able to build the time behind the scenes for
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:15.060]   me to build the other products and services.
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:19.600]   What I intend to do for the Patreon campaign is I think I'm going to lower the prices for
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:23.880]   – the feedback that I've gotten is the most valuable thing that people really appreciate
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:25.400]   is the Facebook group.
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:29.440]   There's just an awesome community of men and women there in the Facebook group answering
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:31.880]   questions, interacting with each other.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:35.280]   I think it would be beneficial to have more people there, and so I think I'm going to
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.680]   lower the price of that level.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:44.920]   I'm removing the top tier mastermind option because – well, I'm removing that top tier
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:48.160]   and I'm probably going to lower down the $25 level.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:53.680]   What I haven't figured out how to do is what bonus or benefit to offer to people above
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:58.760]   – if I lower the price on the Facebook group, I haven't figured out what bonus or benefit
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:03.800]   to offer people at a higher level that I can deliver on.
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.200]   That's why I haven't quite made the changes on the website.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.280]   I'm about ready to do it, but that's what I'm thinking.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:13.080]   I've struggled with regard to the advertising.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:16.760]   Advertising has helped me to bring in more income, but I just don't really like doing
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:22.820]   it and I don't – I try to do a good job with the ads and I've chosen the advertisers
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:23.820]   very carefully.
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:29.720]   They've all been companies and services that I really feel are very valuable for people,
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.800]   but at the end of the day, my best profit potential is for me to create more products
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:42.000]   or courses that are carefully – very, very rich with content and concise.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.200]   That's what I need to spend my time doing.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:48.880]   I'm going to pull back on the frequency of the shows a little bit so that I can create
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.400]   more products and courses.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:56.280]   I'm going to try to get more energy behind the Patreon campaign somehow, especially with
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.920]   the Facebook group.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.200]   I think these calls are going to – my hope is that these calls will help people to participate.
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.480]   I intend to offer these only for patrons.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.600]   Right now, I've opened it up to all patrons, but I think I'm going to open it up to $5
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.240]   and $10 patrons just to ask questions on these Q&A calls.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.560]   Then I'm going to pull back a little bit on the amount of content that I'm creating
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.680]   on the podcast so that I can do more – so I can get some products and some things to
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.160]   sell because that's where my highest profit margins are going to come from and I need
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:30.520]   to help the show be more profitable so I can expand and hire the help that I need to manage
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.320]   more and more of the things behind the scenes.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.000]   I wasn't really quite prepared to answer the question, but hey, that is where it is
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.160]   off the cuff as of 2 p.m. on February the 11th.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:43.160]   That's where I'm at.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.280]   All right.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.280]   Let's go on.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.280]   Next question.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.280]   Hi.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.280]   I'm going to stick with real estate on this question.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:55.200]   I currently have six houses and they're all in my name.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.680]   I was curious what you're going to do with your properties, if you're going to put
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:03.160]   them in an LLC or in a corporation or keep them in your name?
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.800]   I'm not qualified to answer the question professionally.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.800]   Again, it's interesting how much interest there's been in real estate and I'm a
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.440]   total novice on this area.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:20.060]   In the beginning, I will keep them all in my name because I think there are some benefits
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:26.080]   to that and I think the risk of doing that is generally overstated.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.240]   For the initial deals, as I learn how to put together the deals here in my area, I will
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:34.440]   put them in my name.
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:41.800]   As I grow and as my portfolio becomes larger, then I will start to establish some different
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.240]   entities.
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:55.520]   Also, depending on the deal, it's possible that I'll put something into a qualified
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.600]   account of some kind.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:04.120]   I don't mind owning some real estate inside a Roth IRA if I do that appropriately.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.700]   It's also possible that if I do some deals with investors that we would put those into
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:12.360]   an entity of some kind.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:20.560]   My best opinion is that there are advantages and disadvantages to every structure.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.380]   The advantage and disadvantage is going to change depending on where you go.
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:29.880]   The best example I could give that I am actually knowledgeable about would be with regard to
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.560]   business entity selection.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:37.240]   I run Radical Personal Finance currently as a sole proprietorship and I do it intentionally
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:41.560]   because I get a lot of benefits from a sole proprietorship that I wouldn't get if I put
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:44.960]   it into an LLC or into an S corporation.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.200]   A lot of times people say, "Well, you should always just put a business into an S corporation."
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.040]   There are advantages but there are also disadvantages to an S corporation.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:59.440]   If I built Radical Personal Finance first as a sole proprietorship, I will transition
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.060]   it very soon into a business entity.
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:08.960]   When I do that, I'll lose one set of advantages but gain another set of advantages.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.240]   I believe it's the same with real estate.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:18.680]   Each thing that you do has benefits and each thing that you do has disadvantages and restrictions.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:23.320]   Is that helpful?
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.320]   Sure.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:27.120]   Good luck in your purchases.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:31.600]   I think, and this is for me, just the ease of buying and selling when you're trying to
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.880]   close quickly and just write a check.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:40.600]   At this point, I don't want to get involved with establishing an entity in the initial
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.360]   stages, but I think it makes sense down the road.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:44.360]   Best I got.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:48.040]   Mine's a little tricky because I have six houses but they're in three different states.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:52.800]   If I did LLCs, I think I'd have to have one in each state.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:58.000]   That's a specialty area where I have no idea how that works beyond me at this point.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   All right, next question.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   I'll take one more question here on today's call.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.400]   I want to go, Mohamed, are you still on the show?
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.400]   You wanted to ask a question.
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.760]   Yeah, I would love to ask a question.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:14.200]   My question is, is it worthwhile for me to pick up any extra shifts for extra income?
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.840]   My background is I'm 37.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:16.840]   I have no student loans.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:17.840]   I paid those all off.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:21.040]   I have a small condo that I paid off.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:27.120]   I'm planning to be financially independent in about three years.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:32.600]   What would you be giving up by picking up extra shifts?
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:37.280]   Free time, whatever it is that I do with my free time, either go to the gym or hang out
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.280]   at a coffee shop, library, bookstore.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:42.320]   I don't have a family, so I'm single.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.920]   Pretty much just be social time or relaxing time.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:50.720]   Would you feel greatly hindered or hurt or feel like you've given up something very important
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:55.440]   if you were to have less free time in exchange for more money?
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.440]   Probably not.
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:00.440]   I mean, I think I could shuffle things around a little bit, try to have a better regimen
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:05.760]   to prep food on time and have a little bit more time early in the day maybe to go to
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:10.040]   the gym.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:15.640]   I guess for me, the question of once you reach a certain point, what you're always trying
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.920]   to figure out is what is the opportunity cost of this decision?
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.360]   What am I giving up by doing this?
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.640]   So if there's something that were very important to you, and I'll just give my example.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.000]   We're in different situations.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.880]   But for me, if I were working a lot of hours as a physician, I'm away from the home, and
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:36.680]   now I'm going to say I'm going to pick up extra shifts, if that took me away from something
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:41.640]   that were very important, time with my kids, being able to put them in bed, well, I would
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:46.680]   be slow to pay that cost because at this stage of my life, those things are more important
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.680]   to me.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.520]   If you're just comparing it, however, to free time, I don't personally – me personally,
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:54.480]   I don't take or create a lot of free time.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.320]   Most of my time is pretty given to things.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:59.360]   So if it's just, "Well, I'm going to sit around or do something that's not so important
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.160]   to me," then I don't see any reason not to put the work in.
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:07.880]   It could help you potentially to get closer to financial independence in – maybe it's
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:09.240]   there in two years.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.440]   And then what are you going to do at that point in time?
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.840]   So if there's something really compelling and you can shorten out the process to two
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:20.080]   years – I like to work hard and work hard in shifts.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.560]   It works well for my personality.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:25.440]   I can really pour myself into something for a short period of time.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.200]   So you obviously have to be careful to avoid burning yourself out.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.280]   Pay attention to your health.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.640]   Pay attention to how you're feeling and those things.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:36.520]   But as long as you value the money more than what you value what you're giving up, I don't
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:40.920]   see any reason not to, but that's a very subjective decision.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:41.920]   Any more comments?
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:42.920]   Is that helpful, Mohamed?
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:45.360]   Yeah, that's actually pretty helpful.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.080]   Thank you.
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:54.800]   Opportunity cost is the greatest undiscussed – it's the biggest undiscussed thing that
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.600]   we have in our – we don't consider it.
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:02.440]   And so we need to constantly be thinking about opportunity cost.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:03.440]   What am I giving up?
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.440]   And that opportunity cost will change at different points in time.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:11.200]   And so it's okay for one phase to say I'm working right now.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.760]   I'm working like crazy and this is important to me.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:21.360]   And it's okay at another phase to say I'm not ready to work at this point in time.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.080]   There's no external scorecard.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:26.680]   It's got to be based upon our own internal values.
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:30.640]   And I find that challenging a lot of times because I look at other people who do more
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:35.040]   than I do or who make more money than I do or who have other things and I often find
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.200]   it easy to compare myself to other people.
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:40.360]   I have to constantly remind myself, "Joshua, they share different values.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.240]   They have a different vision for their life.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.640]   They have different goals.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:48.060]   Stay focused on your values and your goals."
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:52.940]   So if we consider that, I think we can make better choices.
[01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:55.880]   Thank you all for calling in on the call today.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:59.960]   I hope that these answers have been useful and I hope that you'll check back next week

[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.400]   I really enjoy interacting with you guys.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:11.000]   I just want to say, however, I do my best to give you an answer, but don't take what
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.200]   I have to say as gospel truth.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:16.680]   You got to take it and test it, weigh it out, research it.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:21.360]   If you found any area in which I've been wrong today or I've said something that wasn't
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.760]   correct, I'm happy to learn about that.
