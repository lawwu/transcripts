[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   Well, it's a blunt question and it's a personal question.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.440]   And it's a question from the UK from a listener named Tim who asks this, "Pastor John, my
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.080]   question is simply this.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.920]   Is John Piper happy?
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.720]   You're clearly convinced biblically by Christian hedonism and have shown so helpfully over
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.320]   the many years how pursuing enjoyment in God brings him great glory.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.320]   But how has this worked out in your life experience?
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.800]   How much of your Christian hedonism rests on the hope of the future and being glorified
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.800]   with Christ?
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.840]   Bottom line, are you happy right now?"
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.160]   I have asked this question to myself many, many times.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.320]   Not only because I have written so much about the importance, indeed, indispensability of
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:58.040]   being happy in God, but also because the Bible simply says to John Piper, "Rejoice in the
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.040]   Lord, John Piper."
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.640]   And again, I say, "Rejoice."
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.960]   It's not a matter of mere personality, as Tim points out.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.120]   It is a command of Scripture.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.440]   So I take up the question, not because I feel any external constraint coming from one of
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.160]   our listeners, but because I live with the question all the time, because I live with
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.240]   the Bible all the time.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.280]   So before I answer—and I will give a straight-out answer to the question, "Is John Piper happy
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.920]   now, ever?"—before I answer the question specifically, let me mention the biblical
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.400]   factors that make the question more complex than a simple yes or no would indicate, even
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.560]   though I'll try to give one.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.120]   First, there is the biblical reality that Christians are not only obligated to rejoice,
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.120]   but obligated to be sad.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.660]   Obligated to be sad.
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.980]   We are commanded to weep with those who weep, and I presume we're not supposed to be hypocrites
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.920]   when we do it.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.920]   According to Romans 12, "Weep with those who weep.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.360]   Rejoice with those who rejoice."
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.960]   For Paul says in Romans 9, at the beginning of that chapter, that he has constant anguish,
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.840]   that he's weeping all the time, in some sense, in his heart, because of the lostness
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.840]   of his fellow Jews.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.920]   And Peter says in 1 Peter 1.6 that we are to rejoice even while being grieved through
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.040]   various trials.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.480]   Not just threatened by trials, but really grieved, feeling them as grievous, yet rejoicing.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:50.520]   And 2 Corinthians 6.10 says Christians are "sorrowful, yet always rejoicing."
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.120]   So, the first thing to be said about being happy in God is that in the Christian heart
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.960]   that is sensitive to the sorrows of the world, happiness will always be intermingled with
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.960]   sorrow.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:15.800]   How this looks will probably vary from personality to personality, but in this fallen world,
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:26.600]   true spiritual happiness, that is, Holy Spirit-given happiness, will always be experienced as conflicted
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.680]   and not perfectly harmonious.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.280]   That's certainly true for me, anyway.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.680]   Here's the second thing that I need to say before I give my answer.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:49.360]   This tension between sorrow and joy is not merely a tension, but a design by God to make
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.640]   our happiness deeper and purer.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.200]   It's not like they're just in competition, but one of them is serving the other.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:06.240]   Paul makes that so plain in Romans 5, 3-4, that tribulation is serving our hope and our
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.240]   joy.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.480]   It doesn't just combat our joy, though it does that.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.760]   It deepens it and strengthens it.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.320]   And the third thing to say is that Paul talks about a fight of faith.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:31.320]   And since joy and faith are interwoven inextricably, the fight for faith is always a fight for
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.400]   joy.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.440]   And that means for the apostle and all the rest of us, there will be ups and downs as
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.080]   the warfare advances and recedes.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.600]   Fourth, Paul teaches us that the ministry of the apostles, and I think by implication
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.960]   then the ministry of pastors and the ministry of churches, is to, he says, "We work with
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:04.080]   you for your joy," 2 Corinthians 1:24, or Philippians 1:25, "I know that I will remain
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.840]   and continue behind for your progress and joy of faith."
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.800]   In other words, joy is a dynamic thing that not only requires our personal encounter with
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.840]   hope-giving promises in the Bible, but also requires our involvement with the church and
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.760]   with the ministry of the Word that is designed by God to help us fight the fight for joy.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.800]   And that goes up and down.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.080]   So here's my answer to the question, "Is John Piper happy?"
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.320]   Yes, I am happy.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:50.400]   And yes, a huge component of this happiness is what Paul calls in Romans 5 to rejoicing
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.360]   in hope.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.480]   In other words, looking beyond the present reasons for sadness, and they are sometimes
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.840]   overwhelming, which is why we have to do this, looking beyond the reasons for sadness now
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.540]   to the future reasons for joy when all the sad things will be set right.
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:15.880]   God intends for the promises of that future joy to penetrate back into the present and
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:22.500]   sustain us with measures of joy now in the midst of sorrow.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:34.000]   But I would say also that all the failures of my life, I think, can probably be laid
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.720]   at the feet of failures to be happy in God.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.360]   I think all my failures of fear, like when I have copped out on not bearing witness the
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.420]   way I should, all the failures of fear are owing to a failure to rejoice in the promises
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.360]   of God and His care for me and His promise to work with me and through me.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:01.940]   All my failures of anger, which have probably cost me more than I know, are owing to failures
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:07.920]   to rejoice in the providence and grace and goodness of God.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:16.460]   And all my failures of lust are owing to failures of joy that come through pure-eyed sight of
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.500]   God's all-satisfying glory.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.380]   And of course, the list could just go on and on.
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.840]   So yes, I am happy.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:34.000]   I am happy in God, both because of what I experience of Him in His Word and in His world,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.800]   all of it by the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.920]   God is the lodestar of my sky.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.940]   He's the true north of my life compass.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:54.560]   He is the blazing sun at the center of my emotional solar system, and He is the unerasable
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:04.440]   home setting on the GPS of my life, which means that by His grace, when my heart begins
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:14.280]   to wander toward another competing satisfaction besides God, God has always, it's been 70
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.920]   years, I pray that He will be faithful.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.200]   I believe He will be faithful.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:29.560]   He has always exerted a Holy Spirit gravitational pull on me that has brought the planets of
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:37.120]   my life back into their God-treasuring orbits around His glory.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:43.760]   So I very much look forward to the day when I will be free, the day when I'm with Jesus,
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.920]   and I will be free from warfare and free from sinning.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:57.760]   And I think if you ask me the same question in 50 years, I will answer from heaven a simple
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.760]   yes.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.760]   Beautiful.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.760]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.760]   That's a great question, Tim.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.560]   Thank you for sending it in to us.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.200]   And no need to be timid when you ask the questions.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.280]   Make them sharp and pointed, just like Tim did today.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.280]   The more pointed, the better.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.600]   Well, we are going to break for the weekend now, and this is my chance to remind you that
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.400]   you can subscribe to our audio feeds and search our episode archive and even reach us by email
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.400]   with your questions.

[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.160]   And Monday, a listener wants to know what Paul means when he says that all of our works
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.620]   will be tested by fire.
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:38.320]   And how can we work now to ensure eternal gain in the end?
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.320]   Another great question.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.680]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.040]   Have a great weekend, and we will see you on Monday.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.040]   [END]
