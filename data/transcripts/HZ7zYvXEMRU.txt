[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100]   - This may seem like a divergence,
[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.540]   but I and many other people are very curious
[00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.620]   about a recent decision that you made,
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.580]   which was to close your account on Twitter.
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.160]   You still have an Instagram account, I noticed.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.900]   - But I never, I mean, my team manages that.
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.740]   I've never.
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.220]   - It's a lot friendlier over at Instagram.
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.060]   I've been there a lot longer.
[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.700]   - I've never even seen it, so.
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.740]   - Oh, it's pretty good, actually,
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.580]   considering, imagine what would happen if you did de-page it.
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.980]   They're doing a good job with it.
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.140]   But your decision to close your account on Twitter,
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.980]   I think, grabbed a lot of eyes and ears,
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.460]   and there's a lot of questions about why.
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.940]   It was a very large account.
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.580]   It correlated with a number of things
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.800]   that, for the outsider, people might be wondering about,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.300]   new leadership, new people who had been booted off,
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.140]   brought back on, or at least invited back on,
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.420]   and so on.
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.900]   You are certainly not obligated to explain your behavior
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.060]   to me or anybody else, for that matter.
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.100]   But I'm curious if you might share with us
[00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.820]   what the motivation was for taking the account down,
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.740]   and how you feel in the absence of,
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.860]   I mean, your thumbs presumably are freed up
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.700]   to do other things.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.460]   - Yeah, I was getting like an arthritic right thumb,
[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.900]   I think, and I think it's.
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.980]   - If you don't mind sharing,
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.740]   I think there's a lot of curiosity about you
[00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.980]   and your routines.
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.960]   You've been very generous in sharing that, your knowledge,
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.980]   but also kind of like what makes you tick,
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.660]   what motivates pretty big decisions like that.
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.740]   It wasn't a major platform for you.
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.700]   - Right, yeah.
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.200]   Yeah, it was the only social media platform
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.700]   I've ever engaged.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.100]   Like you said, I have an Instagram,
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.340]   I have a Facebook account,
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.540]   but I never use those as platforms, right?
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.380]   I was never on them, I've never followed people,
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.740]   and I've never, and all the posting has just come from,
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.940]   it's just marketing, you know, from my team.
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.220]   But Twitter was me, I mean, you know, for better or worse.
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.940]   And I began to feel more and more for worse.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.540]   And it was interesting because it was very,
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.500]   you know, I've talked about it a lot on my podcast
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.780]   about just my love-hate relationship
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.140]   with Twitter over the years.
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.920]   Many good things came to me from Twitter,
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.420]   and I was following a lot of smart people,
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.820]   and it had become my newsfeed
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.580]   and my first point of contact with information each day.
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.900]   And I was really attached to it just for that reason,
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.480]   just as a consumer of content.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.860]   And then it was also a place where I was,
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.980]   I genuinely wanted to communicate with people
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.060]   and react to things.
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.220]   And, you know, I would see some article
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.180]   that I thought was great, and I would signal boost it,
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.640]   you know, to my, the people following me on Twitter.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.560]   And that was rewarding.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.900]   And I was, I could literally help people on Twitter.
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.640]   Like, I mean, there was a, there were, you know,
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.960]   there are people who I've raised lots of money for
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.720]   on Twitter just by, you know, signal boosting their GoFundMes.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.360]   And so I was engaged in a way that seemed productive.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.960]   But I was always worried
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.960]   that it was producing needless conflict for me
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.880]   and was giving me a signal in my life
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.380]   that I was being lured into responding to
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.540]   and taken seriously that was out of proportion
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.940]   to its representation of any opinion or set of opinions
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.620]   that I should be taken seriously.
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.020]   So I was noticing that, and again, this evolved over years.
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.660]   I mean, this long before,
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.660]   long predated recent changes to Twitter.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.880]   But I was noticing that many of the worst things
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.360]   that had happened for me professionally
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.200]   were first born on Twitter.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.040]   I mean, just like, you know,
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.400]   some conflict I got into with somebody
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.840]   or something that I felt like I needed to podcast about
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.240]   in response to on Twitter, it's just so much of it.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.480]   It's either, it's Genesis was Twitter
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.480]   or it's the further spin of it
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.260]   that became truly unpleasant and dysfunctional
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.100]   happened on Twitter.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.980]   Like it was just, Twitter was part of the story
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.420]   when it was got really bad.
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.620]   And I've had, you know, vacations that have gone sideways
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.460]   just because I got on Twitter and said something
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.260]   and then I had to produce a controversy
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.140]   that I had to respond to.
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.180]   And then I had to do a podcast about that and blah.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.420]   It just, and it was just, okay, this is a mess, right?
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.660]   And so at that point, you know, I have friends
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.520]   who, you know, also had big Twitter platforms
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.880]   who would say, you know, why are you, you know,
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.600]   why are you responding to anything on Twitter?
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.280]   Just tweet and ghost, you know, just due to heaven.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.760]   Joe Rogan sat me down and tried to get, you know,
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   give me a talking to, as did Bill Maher.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.120]   And both of them engaged Twitter in that way.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.880]   I mean, I think they basically never look
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.040]   at their ad mentions.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.360]   They never see what's coming back at them.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.560]   They just, you know, they use it effectively
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.440]   the way I use or don't even use Instagram or Facebook.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.720]   I don't even see what's going out there in my name.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.980]   And so I could essentially do that
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.060]   for myself on Twitter, presumably.
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.300]   And I did that for some periods of time,
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.220]   but then I would continually decide, okay,
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.700]   now it's all balanced again.
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.020]   Maybe I can just communicate here.
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.980]   'Cause it was very tempting
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.340]   for me to communicate with people
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.060]   because I would see somebody, you know,
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.980]   clearly misunderstanding something I had said on my podcast.
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.480]   And I think it's like,
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.520]   why not clarify this misunderstanding, right?
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.520]   And my efforts to do that almost invariably produced a,
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.800]   this, I mean, sometimes it was a kind
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.680]   of a meandering process of discovery,
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.160]   but often it was just kind of a stark confrontation
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.040]   with what appeared to me to be just lunacy
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.840]   and malevolence on a scale
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.200]   that I never encounter elsewhere in my life.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.660]   Like I never meet these people in life, right?
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.100]   And yet I was meeting these people
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.300]   by the tens of thousands on Twitter.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.580]   And so the thing that began to worry me about it,
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.580]   and again, I understand that people
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.260]   have the opposite experience.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.100]   I mean, depending on what you're putting out
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.940]   and what's your, you know,
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.900]   the kinds of topics you're touching,
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.900]   you could have just nothing
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.900]   but love coming back at you on Twitter, right?
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.600]   But because I'm very essentially in the center politically,
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.480]   and because I'm, you know, this is now on my podcast,
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.020]   this is not in the Waking Up app,
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.920]   I'm often criticizing the far left
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.320]   and criticizing the far right.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.400]   I'm basically pissing off everyone some of the time, right?
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.240]   And it's very different.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.420]   If you're only criticizing the left,
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.360]   no doubt you get hate from the left,
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.280]   but you have all the people on the right
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.780]   who just reflexively and tribally
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.180]   are expressing their solidarity for you, right?
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.820]   And who are dunking on your enemies for you,
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.340]   and you know, when your enemies come out of the woodwork.
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.660]   And if you're only criticizing the right,
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.420]   I'm sure you get a lot of pain from the right,
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.900]   but you've got the people on the left
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.780]   who are tribally identified with the left
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.140]   who are just going to reflexively defend you.
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.220]   If you're in the center, criticizing the left
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.900]   as hard as anyone on the right ever criticizes the left,
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.200]   and you're also criticizing the right
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.500]   as hard as anyone on the left criticizes the right,
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.880]   you're getting hate from both sides all the time.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.180]   And no one is reflexively and tribally defending you
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.260]   because you pissed them off last time.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.180]   You're like, you might be getting hate from the left now,
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.160]   and the people on the right agree with you,
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.260]   but they can't forget the thing you said about Trump
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.720]   on that podcast, you know, two podcasts ago.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.380]   So they're not going to defend you.
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.700]   And so I basically created hell for myself on Twitter
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.740]   because it was just a theater of--
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.820]   it was just pure cacophony most of the time.
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.660]   And what I was seeing was--
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.140]   I mean, there's no way there's this many psychopaths
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.400]   in the world, but I was seeing psychopaths everywhere.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.700]   I was seeing the most malicious dishonesty and, you know,
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.580]   just goalposts moving and hypocrisy.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.460]   And I mean, it was just--
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.060]   I mean, some of it's trolling, and some of it's real confusion,
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.300]   and some of it is psychopathy.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:37.900]   But it's like, it was so dark that I
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.900]   worried that it was actually giving me
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:50.060]   a very negative and sticky view of humanity that was--
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.420]   I mean, one, it was--
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.900]   I think it is inaccurate.
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.820]   But two, it was something I was returning to so much.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.420]   Because again, I was checking Twitter, you know,
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.820]   at least a dozen times a day.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:03.900]   And I'm sure there were some days where
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.100]   I checked it 100 times a day.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.700]   I mean, it was-- again, it was my main source of information.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.380]   I was constantly reading articles
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.580]   and then putting my own stuff out.
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.380]   That it became this kind of funhouse mirror
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:20.780]   in which I was looking at the most grotesque side of humanity
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:26.100]   and feeling, you know, implicated in ways
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.660]   that were important because it was just--
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.940]   it was reputationally important or seemed to be important.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.660]   I know a lot of these people.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.420]   These weren't just faceless trolls.
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.020]   These are people with whom I have had relationships,
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.460]   and in some cases, friendships, who because of what, you know,
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.660]   largely Trump and COVID did to our political landscape
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.020]   in the last, you know, half a dozen years,
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.020]   were beginning to act in ways that seemed, you know,
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.740]   starkly dishonest and, you know, crazy-making to me.
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.380]   So I was just noticing that I was
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.900]   forming a view of people who I actually
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.380]   have had dinner with that was way more
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.700]   negative based on their Twitter behavior
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.340]   than I think would ever be justified by any way
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.020]   they would behave in life with me, you know?
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.420]   I mean, that's like--
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.860]   I was never going to have a face-to-face encounter
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.740]   with any of these people that was
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:25.780]   this malicious and dishonest and gaslighting and weird, right,
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.180]   as was what was happening hourly on Twitter, right?
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:35.980]   And so I just began to become more sensitive to what
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.100]   this was, you know, just the residue of all
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:45.660]   of this in my life and just how often the worst thing about me
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.500]   in my relationship with the people in my life,
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.980]   you know, just talking to my wife or my kids,
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.060]   was just the fact that I had been on Twitter at some point
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.980]   in the-- you know, previously, in the previous hour,
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.700]   and there was some residue of that, you know,
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.020]   in my interaction with them.
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.900]   You know, I was like, what are you stressed out about?
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.060]   What are you annoyed about?
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.540]   What are you pissed off about?
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.780]   What can't you get out of your head?
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.340]   What is the thing that you now feel
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.020]   like you need to spend the next week of your life focused on
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.340]   because it went so sideways for you?
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.940]   All of that was Twitter, you know?
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.820]   I mean, literally 100% of that was Twitter.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.980]   And so I just-- at one point, it was actually on Thanksgiving
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.020]   day, I just looked at this, and I just--
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.380]   I mean, there was very little thought went into it.
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.460]   I mean, literally, I mean, you know,
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.100]   there was more thought involved in, you know,
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.380]   whether I wanted coffee when you asked me when I showed up here.
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.900]   I mean, it was just like, at a certain point, I just saw it,
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.580]   and I just ripped the Band-Aid off.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.540]   And yeah, so--
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.940]   and to answer your other question,
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.260]   it's been almost wholly positive,
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.180]   as you might expect, given the litany of pain and discomfort
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.180]   I just ran through.
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.420]   But I mean, it's also--
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.820]   it's surprising to recognize how much of a presence
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:08.060]   it was in my life, given the sense of what is now missing.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.220]   I mean, it's like, there's--
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.380]   it was-- there's no question there was--
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.340]   there's kind of an addictive component to it.
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.260]   And when you see--
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.580]   like, when I look at what Elon's doing on Twitter,
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.100]   forget about his ownership of it.
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.740]   And I'm not-- you know, I've got a lot
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.580]   to say about the choices he's making for the platform.
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:29.260]   But just his personal use of it is just so obviously
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.620]   an expression of--
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.380]   I mean, I don't know if addiction is the clinically
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:41.020]   appropriate term, but his dysfunctional attachment
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.140]   to tweet to using the platform.
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.900]   Forget-- again, forget about changing it and owning it.
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:50.180]   But just the degree to which it is pointlessly
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.380]   disrupting the life of one of the most productive people
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.620]   in any generation.
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.140]   I-- that was also instructive to me.
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.140]   Because I know Elon, and I just--
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:11.100]   you know, he's from a friend's eye view of the situation.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.500]   It's so obviously not good for him
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.620]   that he's spending this much time on Twitter.
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.020]   That I just brought that back to me.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.340]   It's like, well, if it's not--
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.900]   if this is what it's doing to Elon,
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.140]   and he's got all these other things he could be doing
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.140]   with his attention, how much of my use of Twitter
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.220]   is actually a good idea and optimized to my well-being
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.660]   and the well-being of the people around me.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.980]   So anyway, it was--
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.420]   there was an addictive component to it, I think.
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.940]   And so when that got stripped off,
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.220]   I do notice that there's--
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.860]   I mean, there are times I pick up my phone,
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.980]   and I realize this is like the old me picking up
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.540]   my phone for a reason that no longer exists.
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.180]   Because it's not that much--
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.660]   I have a Slack channel with my team,
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.100]   and I've got email, obviously.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.380]   But it's like that is not much of what
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.420]   I was doing with my phone, really, in the end.
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.780]   And so it's just my phone is much less
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.820]   of a presence in my life.
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.340]   And so it's almost wholly good.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:15.340]   But yeah, I think there is some danger in--
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.340]   or some possible danger in losing touch
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.900]   with certain aspects of culture.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.220]   Which again, I'm not even sure--
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.860]   I mean, there's this question of how much is Twitter real life,
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.540]   and how much is it just a mass delusion?
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.820]   I don't know.
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.900]   But insofar as it actually matters
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:35.980]   what happens on Twitter, or insofar as I was actually
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.780]   getting a news diet, which I'm not
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.060]   going to be able to recapitulate for myself,
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.500]   or I'm just not, in fact, going to recapitulate for myself,
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.980]   even if I could, if any of that matters,
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.540]   I haven't discovered that yet.
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.340]   But it's-- yeah, I mean, there's--
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.340]   it was taking up an immense amount of bandwidth,
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.420]   and it's impressive.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.740]   I mean, I think I said I--
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.420]   it was like I amputated a phantom limb, right?
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.180]   Like, it was not a real limb, but it
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:06.780]   was this continuous presence in my life that--
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.020]   that-- it's weird.
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.820]   It actually relates to the concept of self
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.900]   in surprising ways.
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.420]   Because I felt there was a part of myself
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.500]   that existed on Twitter.
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.220]   And I just performed a suicide of that self, right?
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.580]   Like, that's-- this is ending right now.
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.840]   You know, there's no residue.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.380]   There's nothing to go back and check.
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.940]   There's just-- it's gone.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.740]   And I didn't even--
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.300]   I didn't go back and look at my--
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.540]   like, what's interesting to consider is that, you know,
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.980]   I'd been on Twitter for 12 years.
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.020]   I don't keep a journal.
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.020]   I mean, Twitter-- my timeline would
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.140]   have been a kind of journal.
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.860]   I could have gone back to a specific hour
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.180]   and a specific day and looked at what
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.060]   I was paying attention to.
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.640]   I mean, that could have been an interesting record of just who
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.020]   I've been for a decade, and probably a pretty humbling
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.420]   record of who I've been for a decade in terms
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.220]   of the kinds of things that captivated my attention.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.620]   But I didn't even--
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.020]   you know, I didn't even think to go, you know, nostalgically
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.940]   just look at any of that or see if any of it
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.180]   was worth saving or archiving or thinking--
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.780]   I just-- just delete, you know?
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:15.160]   And it was-- and so my actual sense of who I am
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:20.160]   and my engagement with my audience, my--
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.400]   you know, the world of people who could potentially know me,
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.600]   like, what does it mean to be-- to have a platform?
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.240]   You know, where do I exist digitally?
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:34.840]   My sense of all of that got truncated in a--
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.680]   in a way that is much less noisy.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.560]   I mean, it's amazing how much can't get
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.560]   fucked up now in my life.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:50.040]   Like, it's like, with Twitter, almost anything could happen.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:50.520]   Right?
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.960]   Like, the next tweet was always an opportunity
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.400]   to massively complicate my life.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.040]   There is no analogous space for me now.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.400]   And, you know, so what I'm going to say on your podcast,
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.080]   what I'm going to say on my own podcast,
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:09.980]   what I'm going to write next, that's much more, you know,
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.940]   deliberative and the opportunities
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.740]   to take my foot out of my mouth or to reconsider all--
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.620]   you know, whether any of this is worth it.
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.260]   Is it worth-- is this the hill I really want to die on now?
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.140]   It's much more--
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.540]   can be much more considered.
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.780]   And I mean, I think all of that's to the good.
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.740]   But even more important than that is there's not--
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.500]   I'm not getting this continuous signal that is always
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.700]   inviting a response, whether on Twitter or on my own podcast
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.340]   or, you know, anywhere else.
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.620]   And it's just much less noisy.
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.380]   I mean, life is much less noisy and cluttered.
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.140]   And that's-- you know, that is--
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.940]   it definitely feels better.
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.860]   It just-- it's 100% better.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.580]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.160]   (upbeat music)
