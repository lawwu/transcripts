[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.460]   Pastor John, here's today's question. Hello Pastor John, my name is Jennifer and I live on a Long Island. I have a question about complementarianism
[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.980]   It is something I've struggled with for a long time and it is something I need to have worked out before even considering a relationship
[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.120]   Or marriage in the future
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.160]   I know the Bible clearly states that men and women are equal in their standing before God as far as salvation
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.820]   But in all other areas of life, I still struggle with the feelings of inferiority because of certain comparisons used in the Bible
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.960]   for example regarding submission
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.840]   The Bible says that the servant is not greater than his master and wives are called to submit to their husbands as the church submits
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.500]   to Christ
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.760]   However, servants are not equal to their masters and the church is not equal in worth to Christ in almost every area of life
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.840]   Those in positions of authority are considered more valuable than those under that authority
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.240]   Just like the president is more valuable than the secret servicemen and in businesses
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.900]   Managers are more valued than the workers under them and throughout history women have always been treated as less valuable than men
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.120]   In light of these things, I greatly struggle with feeling inferior in worth to men
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.660]   Is there something that you might be able to see that I am missing as I read through Scripture? Thank you.
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.240]   I want to tackle the two
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.980]   particular kinds of texts that trouble Jennifer in just a moment, but first
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.900]   Let me venture a general statement about female superiority and inferiority and male
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.780]   superiority and
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.360]   inferiority in relationship to each other. I
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:43.180]   think most of the time we are so eager to say the appropriate thing about equality
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.240]   that we overlook the obvious
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.780]   inequalities that exist between men and women. So how should we speak about these?
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.380]   I'm thinking of things like
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:03.540]   In general men are physically stronger so that in the Olympics in most events men and women don't compete with each other
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:12.500]   or things like women being superior at singing soprano or bearing children or nursing children and my guess is if
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.780]   objectivity were possible in the research, which in our politically correct day
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.720]   I don't think it is, but if objectivity were possible in the research
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.740]   there would be countless studies about nuanced
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.900]   psychological, verbal, analytical, synthetic, emotional
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.180]   differences between men and women in general that in some areas would give
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.960]   woman the edge and in other areas would give man the edge. I think those those studies probably have been done and buried because
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.500]   they would be offensive perhaps. I don't know, but that's my opinion. So here's my theological
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.060]   bottom line on this matter. If God were to make a
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.020]   list of female
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.620]   superiorities and
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.620]   inferiorities and a list of male
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:14.620]   superiorities and inferiorities, and if God were to attach to each of these a relative value in
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.940]   his whole scheme of things
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:25.580]   the sum of the pluses and minuses at the bottom of each column would be equal.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:33.380]   Now I can't prove that and I don't think anybody can disprove that. I infer it
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.260]   from one, male and female are both created in the image of God. Two,
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.660]   both are fellow heirs of the grace of life. Three, both are given an
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.940]   indispensable role in the achievement of God's ultimate purposes. Four,
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:57.420]   Paul seems to be thinking this way in 1st Corinthians 11, 11, and 12 when he says, "In the Lord woman is not
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.260]   independent of man
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.620]   nor
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.180]   man of woman. For as woman was made from man,
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.780]   so man is now born of woman, and all things are from God." So he seems to be bent on
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.100]   affirming
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.060]   difference and
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.220]   affirming that with every difference there is a kind of counterpoint of
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.300]   indispensability.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.980]   Now I hope that one of the effects all those thoughts have on
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.380]   Jennifer and others who struggle with the same thing she's feeling is that
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.140]   she wouldn't have to be
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:50.700]   artificial in her thinking about male and female differences in order to believe in profound, ultimate, overall, God-designed
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.020]   equality. It's not a simple thing like
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:04.100]   insisting that women are as good at everything as men are or men are as good at everything as women are. They're not.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.860]   Neither man is nor woman is.
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:15.180]   Jennifer mentions two texts that have really troubled her, and I think I get it, and so let me try to help.
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:23.540]   Two times, this is one kind of text, but two instances, Jesus says, John 13, 16 and John 15, 20, "A
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:30.540]   servant is not greater than his master." And since servants are to be submissive
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:37.140]   to masters and wives to husbands, this makes Jennifer feel inferior or less
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:44.820]   great. A servant is not as great as the master. But notice two things. One,
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.740]   servants may indeed be greater than their masters in many ways.
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.740]   They may be stronger, more intelligent, wiser,
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:02.260]   kinder, more industrious. And Jesus knew that as well as we do.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.300]   The other thing to notice is that in the context,
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:14.900]   Jesus's point in both those passages is not to comment on the absence of a servant's
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.820]   equality, but the absence of the servant's superiority.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:28.180]   In the first case, he did this. He emphasizes this to stress that the servant
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:36.780]   should do the same kind of foot washing that Jesus did. And in the second case, to stress that the servant should expect the same
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.980]   persecution that Jesus did. So the point,
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.620]   surprisingly, is to stress the
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:53.540]   equality of the service to be rendered and the equality of the persecution to be experienced. Not that slaves are in every way,
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:59.380]   or in some overall way, inferior to masters. The second text that troubles
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:07.020]   Jennifer is the comparison between marriage and the relationship between Christ and the church. Wives are to submit to husbands as
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:14.820]   the church does to Christ, Ephesians 5. But, she observes rightly, the church is not equal
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.580]   in worth to Christ.
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.900]   Now,
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:27.740]   what I would ask Jennifer to consider here is whether the point of comparison
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.700]   between Christ and the church, on the one hand, and
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.900]   husband and wife, on the other hand, whether the point of comparison is
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.220]   the degree of
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.740]   inferiority or superiority. Is that the point?
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.420]   Clearly, Christ is sinless, and
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:54.660]   the church is sinful. Is that the point of comparison? Husband sinless, wife sinful?
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.020]   Clearly, Christ is
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:04.020]   infinite and eternal, and the husband is finite, and I mean the church is finite and temporal. Is that the point of comparison?
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.300]   Husband's infinite,
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:14.740]   wife's finite. We have to be so careful with analogies or comparisons, lest we assume a
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:20.780]   point of comparison that is not the point of comparison that is being shown.
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:29.380]   Now, I would say—this is my venture to try to understand—I would say that the point of the
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:34.900]   comparison between Christ and the church here, and husband and wife here, is
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.780]   that owing to creation and
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.740]   God's design for it—
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.020]   Genesis 2:24 is cited right here in Ephesians 5:31—
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:51.580]   owing to God's design in creation, the point of comparison is that
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.620]   godly,
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:58.420]   mature manhood and womanhood are of such a nature
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:03.340]   that they both experience a sense of fitness and
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.140]   suitableness and appropriateness in the roles of
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:13.540]   manhood as humble leadership and protection and provision, and womanhood as
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:19.260]   gladly affirming that leadership and partnering with a man in the use of her gifts to carry it through. And
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.500]   whether that fitness—whether that fitness
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.740]   lies in some overall superiority or inferiority
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:34.820]   need not be implied in this text about husbands and wives, I don't think it is
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:43.620]   implied. So, I pray that God would give to Jennifer and many, I'm sure, who feel
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.060]   what she feels—a
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:53.220]   wonderful sense of peace in who she is in Christ, with all the glorious things that
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:58.820]   in Christ implies for his care and her value and her
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:06.660]   inheritance, and I pray that she would find the teaching of the Bible on manhood and womanhood
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.140]   liberating and
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.020]   satisfying rather than
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:11.980]   troubling.
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.260]   Yes, amen. Thank you, Pastor John, for this answer and for explaining
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:23.180]   complementarity for decades, and now to a new generation of young Christians who are now thinking through these issues with an eye towards marriage
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.580]   compatibility and
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:31.460]   who want to know how we can honor God in our homes and churches without simply following the intuition so often cultivated by the
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:38.980]   prevailing winds of the age in which we live. I appreciate that, Pastor John. And with that, the week has come to a close on
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:44.300]   Monday. We're gonna look at Romans 8. Specifically, what does it mean that God will glorify us?
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.420]   What in the world does that mean?
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.740]   You've been listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast, longtime author and pastor John Piper.
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:57.460]   You can find our audio feeds and you can find our archive of old episodes all at our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:02.940]   I'm your host Tony Ranke. Have a great weekend.
