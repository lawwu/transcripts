[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.280]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.340]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.240]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.040]   Today, my guest is Dr. Emily Balchetes.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.240]   Dr. Balchetes is a professor of psychology
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.880]   at New York University.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.920]   Her laboratory studies motivation, goal setting,
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.240]   and tools for successful goal completion.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.840]   I learned about Dr. Balchetes' work
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.060]   some years ago because I'm a vision scientist.
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.880]   That is, I study the visual system.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.100]   And I heard about this incredible psychologist
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.880]   at New York University who was studying how vision,
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.800]   that is how we visualize problems,
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.120]   can predict whether or not we will successfully
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.640]   overcome challenges and how we strategize
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.120]   in order to set and meet goals.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.240]   And in 2020, I learned of Dr. Balchetes' book,
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.000]   which was written for the general public,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.100]   entitled "Clearer, Closer, Better,
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.320]   How Successful People See the World."
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.600]   And I read both the hard copy of the book
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.560]   and listened to the audio book.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.900]   And I absolutely loved the material.
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.040]   As you'll learn directly from Dr. Balchetes today,
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.260]   how people visualize a problem,
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.280]   that is whether or not they think of a goal or a problem
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.980]   as residing at the top of a very steep hill
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.560]   or on the top of a shallower hill,
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.540]   or whether or not they visualize a goal or a problem
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.000]   as far off in the distance
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.500]   or closer to them in the distance,
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.680]   visually in their mind,
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.420]   strongly dictates whether or not they will arrive
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.360]   at the challenge of meeting a goal
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.620]   or overcoming a problem with more energy or less energy.
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.180]   Indeed, it dictates whether or not
[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.920]   they can push to immediate milestones
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.900]   or whether or not they will think they have to overcome
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.800]   the entire task all at once.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.920]   Basically, Dr. Balchetes' work has discovered
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.320]   that how we visualize a problem or a goal in our mind
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.200]   has everything to do with how we lean into that goal,
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.440]   whether or not we think of it as overwhelming or tractable,
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.740]   whether or not we think that we can overcome that goal
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.080]   and then it will lead to yet more possible rewards and goals
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.520]   or whether or not we feel that we're going to arrive
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.580]   at the finish line and then just be overwhelmed with fatigue.
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.160]   In other words, how you visualize things in your mind,
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.080]   and when I say visualize, I mean, literally,
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.480]   how you visualize them as a visual problem or a visual goal
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.720]   has everything to do with whether or not
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.480]   you will be able to meet those goals
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.080]   and whether or not they will lead to still greater goals
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.000]   that you will be able to achieve.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.400]   Today's episode is an especially important one, I believe,
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.280]   because you're going to learn about
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.160]   quality peer-reviewed science from the expert in this field
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.040]   of goal setting, motivation, and pursuit.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.440]   And you're also going to learn an immense number
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.600]   of practical tools that you can apply
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.940]   toward your educational goals, your career goals,
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.800]   relationship goals, goals of any sort.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.200]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.480]   you will be better equipped to set and achieve your goals.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.840]   Dr. Balchetes also shares with us her own experiences
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.640]   of how to set, visualize, and achieve goals.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.520]   And she does that within the context of her role as a parent,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.080]   as somebody navigating relationships of various kinds
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.520]   and a demanding career.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.160]   So again, I think that you'll find the information today
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.840]   to be both extremely academically grounded
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.320]   in terms of research, extremely practical, and realistic
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.780]   in terms of how you might apply it in your own life.
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.680]   I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.000]   is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.220]   We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.920]   First of all, they ship internationally
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.840]   because we know that many of you are located
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.680]   outside of the United States, that's valuable.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.720]   Second of all, and perhaps most important,
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.240]   the quality of their supplements is second to none,
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.920]   both in terms of purity and precision
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.880]   of the amounts of the ingredients.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.500]   Third, we've really emphasized supplements
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.680]   that are single ingredient supplements
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.760]   and that are supplied in dosages
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.720]   that allow you to build a supplementation protocol
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.560]   that's optimized for cost,
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.440]   that's optimized for effectiveness,
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.600]   and that you can add things and remove things
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.920]   from your protocol in a way
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.620]   that's really systematic and scientific.
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.960]   This is really hard to do
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.840]   if you're taking blends of different supplements
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.580]   or if the dosages are such that you can't titrate,
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.960]   or that is adjust the dosages of a given supplement.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.600]   So by using single ingredient supplements,
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.280]   you can really build out the supplement kit
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.400]   that's ideal for you and your specific needs.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.560]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.880]   that we partner with Momentus on,
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.000]   you can go to livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.120]   There you'll see those supplements,
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.600]   and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.280]   the library of supplements available through Momentus
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.240]   on a regular basis.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.920]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.560]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.420]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.440]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.940]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.740]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.800]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.640]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.680]   Our first sponsor is Thesus.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.960]   Thesus makes custom nootropics.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.920]   And as some of you have probably heard me say before,
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.700]   I'm not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.720]   because nootropics means smart drugs.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.120]   And frankly, as a neuroscientist,
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.940]   the notion of a smart drug is somewhat ridiculous.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.780]   Why?
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.180]   Well, it turns out that we have neural circuits in our brain
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.320]   that get engaged for creativity,
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.960]   and yet other neural circuits that are engaged for focus,
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.180]   and still other neural circuits
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.540]   that are engaged for task switching.
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.000]   So the notion of a smart drug,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   or a drug that can induce smartness, if you will,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.320]   is simply not grounded in science.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.040]   Well, Thesus understands this
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.380]   and has developed custom nootropics
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.720]   that are tailored to the specific types of cognitive demands
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.340]   or physical demands that you might be facing.
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.880]   If you go to Thesus's website,
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.300]   you can take a quiz, and from that,
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.400]   they'll give you a sample of different nootropics
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.300]   that you can try so that you can create
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.420]   a customized kit of nootropics for your specific needs.
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.700]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.700]   just go online to takethesis.com/huberman,
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.740]   take that three-minute quiz,
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.780]   and Thesus will send you four different formulas
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.120]   to try in your first month.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.320]   That's takethesis.com/huberman,
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.220]   and use the code HUBERMAN at checkout
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.520]   to get 10% off your first box.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.740]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.300]   Levels is what's called a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.080]   Some of you may have heard of these before,
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.140]   others of you perhaps have not.
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.120]   Basically, it's a small device
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.220]   that you wear on the back of your arm.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.980]   It's an app that you install on your phone,
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.980]   and whether or not you are fasting or you just ate
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.700]   or you ate several hours ago,
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.340]   you can get a real-time measurement of your blood glucose,
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.860]   which turns out to be extremely informative.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.560]   I first started using the Levels continuous glucose monitor
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.020]   about a year ago, and it's taught me so much
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.980]   about how I respond to specific foods
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.740]   in terms of blood sugar spikes,
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.220]   how I respond to exercise.
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.420]   Even the sauna, it turns out,
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.740]   can modulate my blood glucose levels
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.740]   and your blood glucose levels in very interesting ways.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.220]   So all of that is translated into a huge number
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.220]   of very directed changes that I've made
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.020]   in terms of what I eat, when I eat,
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.860]   and how I schedule exercise relative
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.260]   to eating and sleep, et cetera.
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.380]   If you're interested in trying
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.580]   the Levels continuous glucose monitor yourself,
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.620]   you can simply go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.060]   That's levels.link/huberman.
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.260]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.540]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.360]   that are of the absolute highest quality,
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.820]   and they also have some unique characteristics.
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.980]   The company was founded by two All-American swimmers
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.400]   from Stanford, and everything about Roca eyeglasses
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.520]   and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.620]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses can be worn
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.260]   while running or cycling.
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.540]   If you get sweaty, they won't fall off your face,
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.860]   and they're extremely lightweight.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.300]   In fact, most of the time I can't even remember
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.340]   that I'm wearing them.
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.620]   I wear Roca eyeglasses when I read at night,
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.940]   so I wear their readers, and I wear sunglasses
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.520]   at various times throughout the day.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.560]   The great thing about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.920]   is that even though they were designed
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.860]   for athletic performance, they have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.420]   So unlike a lot of so-called performance glasses
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.260]   that make people look like cyborgs, in my opinion,
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.020]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are the sort
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.080]   that you could wear out to dinner,
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.260]   that you could wear to work.
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.700]   They have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.880]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.280]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.740]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.580]   your first order.
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.660]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A dot com, and enter the code
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.080]   Huberman at checkout.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.580]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Emily Belchettis.
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.740]   - Well, thanks for being here.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.700]   - That's my pleasure.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.880]   - Yeah, I've been looking forward to this for a long time
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.900]   because as a vision scientist who is also very interested
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.020]   in real life tools and goal setting and motivation,
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.560]   your work lands squarely in the middle of those interests.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.100]   So just to kick things off, you could tell us
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.780]   just a little bit about the relationship between perception
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.820]   and in particular, how we see the world,
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.540]   and goal setting and goal retrieval.
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.340]   It's a vast landscape, but you're the expert.
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.060]   So I'll turn that over to you.
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.600]   And then as time goes on, I may have some additional
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.540]   questions as it relates to different kinds of vision,
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.980]   but what's the deal with vision and motivation?
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.340]   How do those two things link up?
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.020]   - Totally, I mean, when psychologists ask people,
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.540]   what are you doing to help make progress on your goals?
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.580]   They say all kinds of things.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.380]   A couple of things always pop to the top,
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.140]   which is try to shock myself in encouraging ways,
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:09.160]   self pep talks, or I remind myself of how important it is
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.680]   to do this job, or I'll put up post-it notes around
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.560]   to constantly be nagging me about what I need to do.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.360]   So those are common tactics that people use.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.660]   And what we'll notice is that those are really effortful,
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.180]   having to constantly remind yourself,
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.620]   having to constantly talk to yourself,
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.060]   having to create those post-it notes,
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:25.980]   remember to look at them.
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.260]   All of that takes a lot of time and effort and commitment.
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.140]   And so what a surprise that people burn out, right?
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.100]   It's exciting to work on a goal when you first set it,
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.620]   you might make some initial progress,
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.820]   but then eventually we get, you know,
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.900]   not even to the halfway point, but before things get real,
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.380]   things are challenging and we fall by the wayside.
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.580]   And that's, I think, because those tactics
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.980]   that are our go-to strategies
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.000]   are themselves a goal to maintain.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.140]   So it's like, you know, double-sided,
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.920]   we're putting so much on ourselves to try to advance
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.780]   the thing that we originally set out to accomplish.
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.200]   So then I, you know, with my team,
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.280]   I was trying to think of like, well,
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.340]   what are strategies that don't require as much effort
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.200]   that we can automate, that we can take advantage
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.160]   of what's already happening within ourselves,
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.120]   within our body, within our mind,
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.100]   that might overcome one of those challenges
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.180]   that'll be easier, more automated.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.860]   And that's when we started to land on the idea of vision.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.580]   We look at the world without even thinking of it
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.740]   for those of us that are excited.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.260]   And we thought, you know what?
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.060]   There are strategies that we can use
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.080]   to look at the world in a different way
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.480]   and that we can automate that might help us
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.700]   to overcome some obstacles, to make progress on our goals,
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.100]   to maybe literally see opportunities
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.260]   that we hadn't been able to see before.
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.980]   So we started playing around with the idea
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.820]   of visual illusions to see, like, do people even know
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.060]   that there's other ways of seeing things around them?
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.660]   Can we tweak that, or is there room for intervention?
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.500]   Can we encourage people to take a new way
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.460]   of looking to see things that they hadn't seen before?
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.460]   And that's what really opened us up to trying to look
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.260]   at that intersection between vision science
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.860]   and motivation science.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.700]   - It's great.
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.860]   And I always say, and here I'm strongly biased
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.540]   as a vision scientist, that vision is the dominant sense
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.660]   by which we navigate the world and survive.
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.160]   I love this idea of real-world, real-time access to vision.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.500]   And I'm certainly familiar with how goal setting
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.640]   or post-its and magnets on refrigerators
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.700]   can have an immediate impact, but then over time,
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.880]   they become so part of the visual landscape
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.720]   that you overlook them.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.980]   And we know as vision scientists,
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.340]   if something is stably in your environment,
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.260]   eventually you're blind to it.
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.780]   So that makes good sense.
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.020]   So you've published a number of studies in this area,
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.800]   but maybe you could highlight some of the more,
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.460]   what you would consider important findings
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.340]   in the area of how people can adjust their vision
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.700]   in order to meet goals more quickly and more efficiently.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:56.460]   And perhaps also how we all arrive at goals
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.580]   with different visual perceptions.
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:03.060]   And that in some way may divide us into highly motivated
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.100]   and less motivated people.
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.240]   In other words, what's the link between vision and motivation
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.380]   and how can we leverage that
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.500]   in order to better reach our goals?
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.340]   - Totally.
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.320]   So, we started thinking about what are the goals
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.580]   that are most important to people
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.400]   that they struggle with the most?
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.400]   So we asked hundreds, thousands of people
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.800]   what their new year's resolutions are.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.280]   We looked to all the other polls
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.300]   that do the same kind of work.
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.420]   And regardless of where you look or who you ask
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.400]   or when you ask it, people's number one goal
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.480]   is something related to their health, right?
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.660]   To lose weight, to exercise more,
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.700]   to get out, get more steps for mental wellbeing,
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.200]   physical wellbeing.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.060]   And that's like the number one goal every January 1st.
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.600]   So if we were able to accomplish that goal,
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.720]   you'd think it would drop a little bit in the rankings,
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.040]   but it doesn't because it's really hard.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.020]   So we thought, I wonder if there's a way for us
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.600]   to make some progress on that,
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.100]   on helping people to exercise better, more often,
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.380]   stick to it longer and make some progress there.
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.980]   We know diets don't work.
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.160]   Why don't diets work?
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.940]   For the same reason that that self-talk doesn't work
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.220]   is that we go in it full bore, hardcore,
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.780]   and it requires a major commitment
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.800]   and effort to a lifestyle change.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.260]   So again, we were looking for something
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.060]   that might be easier than that,
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.520]   that could produce big, big payoff, right?
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.300]   That's the golden ticket,
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.740]   something that requires less effort for a bigger payoff.
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.340]   So one of the first things that I did
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:28.140]   was go over to Brooklyn to this old armory building.
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.100]   It used to be a military armory space.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.140]   - Yeah, I think I know that building.
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.580]   - Yeah. - It's a beautiful building
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.320]   now that houses a lot of businesses, right?
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.420]   With plants on the walls, is that the one?
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.300]   - Yeah, there's businesses.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.500]   There's a couple of armories all around the boroughs here,
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.760]   around New York City.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.680]   And the one in Brooklyn in particular is now YMCA, right?
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.960]   So it's a family YMCA that's within
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.800]   this beautiful old red brick building
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.160]   that used to be a military establishment long, long ago.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.400]   And what's really cool is that one winter after afternoon,
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.140]   somebody had invited me, a physical therapist,
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:00.980]   said, "Hey, you should come out
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.060]   "and check out what's happening here
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.460]   "with your interest in exercise
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.740]   "and trying to find new ways of helping people,
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.360]   "new tactics that they can add to their tool belt.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.820]   "I think you're gonna find some interesting people
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.140]   "that are working out there."
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.860]   So I showed up, I look around,
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.780]   there's families, there's new moms,
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.020]   there's kids that are,
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.620]   moms trying to get kids to burn off
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.340]   some winter energy that they have.
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.180]   There's people that look like
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.860]   they're just there for their,
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.580]   every couple of days going out for a run.
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.460]   There's some people that look like
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.860]   they're training with a team.
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.900]   And that's who this physical therapist introduced me to,
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.100]   is the coach of this team.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.340]   There's a bunch of people that were sitting down
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.000]   on the ground, and I would be hard pressed to know
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.980]   who's the high school student that's in this group,
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.740]   and then who, as it turns out,
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.820]   are some of the fastest runners in the world.
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.020]   Like, one of the people that was in the last Olympics
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.460]   before I showed up won the gold medal for the 400 meter.
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.460]   And from the looks of them, I mean, of course,
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.920]   their bodies are in better shape than mine,
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.220]   but there's nothing so pretentious,
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.380]   of course they're not wearing their medals.
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.420]   There's nothing pretentious about how they're walking around
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.780]   or anything like that that would lead me to know,
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.100]   like, this person's amazing.
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.740]   And they probably have some insight that I don't have.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.220]   So once I got introduced to them
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.560]   and knew who are these people that were part of this
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.460]   pretty elite training team that happened to work out
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.780]   at this family gym, I had the chance to talk with them
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.900]   about what strategies do you use?
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.940]   Now, I am not an elite runner,
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.980]   and having recently had a baby,
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.740]   I'm not really a runner right now at all.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.420]   But I thought, when these people are running,
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.220]   I bet they are, like, hyper aware
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.340]   of everything that's going on in their surroundings.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.780]   Where are they relative to the competition?
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.740]   What's happening in their peripheral vision?
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.880]   What's going on on the side?
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.720]   Who's behind them?
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.100]   Who's in front of them?
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.060]   They probably have this, like, master sense,
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.680]   this master visual plan at any point in time,
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.160]   and that's what probably makes them elite.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.860]   So when I started asking them, is that the case?
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.520]   Do you really pay attention to what's in your surroundings?
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.360]   What's behind you?
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.180]   What's on the side?
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.020]   They said no.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.740]   Like, all of them said no.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.820]   And sometimes when I do do that, it's a mistake.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.100]   It doesn't work for me.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:15:59.940]   So that was surprising.
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.200]   I totally went against my intuition about what they do
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.860]   that likely contributes to their success.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.740]   What they said instead was that they are hyper focused.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.020]   They assume this narrowed focus of attention,
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.860]   almost like a spotlight is shining on a target.
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.140]   Now, when they're running a short distance,
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.020]   that target might literally be the finish line,
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.540]   the line that they're trying to cross.
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.780]   If it's a longer distance, they set sub goals,
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.100]   like, you know, the person, the shorts on the person
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.420]   up ahead that they're trying to beat,
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.060]   or they choose some sort of stable landmark,
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.980]   like a sign that they would pass by.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.140]   And, like, a spotlight is shining just on that,
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.260]   or, like, they have blinders on the sides of their face.
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.540]   That's all they're paying attention to.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.220]   It's really narrowed scope of attention.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:44.260]   And that was a strategy that all of these elite athletes
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.060]   said that they used, and those that were better
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:50.340]   rather than slower were ones that used it more.
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.620]   And I thought, oh, that's something we can play with, right?
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.300]   Like, they are elite and they are accomplished,
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.780]   but that visual strategy isn't necessarily something
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.980]   that you have to be in the perfect physical condition
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.240]   to be able to adopt.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.460]   And so I wonder, can that help the rest of us
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.740]   who aren't competing for an Olympic gold
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.220]   and who have no chance of ever getting one,
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.220]   who want to exercise better,
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.860]   have a better time doing it and maintain a commitment
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.360]   to that exercise goal that they might have
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.180]   that they might otherwise, by February or March,
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.620]   be giving up on if they had set it
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.620]   at the beginning of January.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.420]   So that's really where the work started,
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.260]   was what you might call focus groups
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.100]   or case studies of these incredible athletes.
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.700]   And then we did other studies looking at people
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.460]   who aren't Olympic athletes but who are competitive
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.260]   and New York Road runners,
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.100]   and how are they running in races.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.180]   And what we found is that those people
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.340]   who have better pace, faster pace, better time,
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.740]   they use that narrowed strategy more often
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:51.420]   than this more expansive or open scope of attention.
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.700]   And there seemed to be a correlation
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.800]   between that better performance among a wider swath
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.340]   of hundreds of runners who are doing it competitively
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.140]   but still could be like the person
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.860]   that you're sitting next to in the office or yourself, right?
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.100]   And the more often that they did it
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.220]   and the more consistently they had adopted that,
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.300]   that technique of the narrowed focus of attention,
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.860]   it seemed that they were doing better in their runs.
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:18.220]   So then we started thinking like, okay,
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.180]   what about people who aren't competitive runners?
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.260]   What about like my mom, can she do that?
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.900]   Or me when I'm trying to get back
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.180]   on the bandwagon and exercise more.
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.100]   Is this a tactic we can teach people?
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.660]   The answer is yes.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.940]   You can tell people about
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.500]   what these Olympic athletes are doing.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.340]   You can tell them about
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.580]   what the New York Road Runners are doing.
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.780]   And just using the same language
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.940]   that I just used with you, right?
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.500]   Imagine that there's a spotlight shining just on a target.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.240]   Choose something up ahead,
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.180]   the stop sign two blocks up that you can just see.
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.800]   And imagine that you have blinders on
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.180]   so that you're not really paying attention
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.360]   to the people that are passing by
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.980]   or the buildings or the garbage cans
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.740]   or the trucks that are on the road.
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.940]   Tune those out and focus in on that target
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.040]   until you hit it and then choose another one, right?
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.140]   Sort of recalibrate, choose the next goal.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.480]   And so we would test like, can people do that?
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.740]   I mean, if you're listening right now,
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.940]   you probably are imagining that experience too.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:13.820]   And the answer is yes.
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:14.840]   Like I can imagine that.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.120]   I know what those words mean and I can do that.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.260]   And our work found that too, if people can do that,
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.400]   we have them say out loud,
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.600]   what is it that's captured your attention?
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.420]   And of course, sometimes something in the periphery,
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.180]   like movement captures our gaze
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.580]   and we're pulled there for an instant,
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.540]   but then we can refocus up again
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.820]   and adopt that narrowed attention.
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.440]   One of the first studies that we did
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.280]   was teach that strategy and juxtapose or compare it
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.460]   against a group that we said, just look around naturally.
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.440]   You might see that finish line up ahead
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.760]   and there's things on the periphery,
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.040]   whatever your eyes want to do,
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.300]   whatever you think is gonna work best,
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.940]   feel free to do that and tell us what you're looking at.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.060]   Then we gave them a finish line.
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.340]   We created sort of an exercise
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.100]   that's moderately challenging, but possible.
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.260]   We put ankle weights on that accounted
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.940]   for about 15% of their body weight,
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.220]   told them to lift their knees up,
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.580]   sort of high stepping to a finish line.
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:07.020]   So this would be challenging for them to do,
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.340]   but we said it's an indicator of overall health and fitness.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.360]   Some of these people had narrowed their focus of attention
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.740]   and some were just looking more expansively or naturally.
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.580]   And what we found is that those people that we trained,
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.260]   just everyday normal people
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.300]   doing this moderately challenging exercise,
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.600]   they were able to move 27% faster.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.260]   They could do the exercise more quickly
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.700]   and they said it hurt 17% less.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.760]   The exercise was exactly the same for all the people.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.780]   We set the weight and we set the distance.
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.420]   It was in our lab space,
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.620]   so it was a constrained environment.
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.380]   Everybody was in the same sort of circumstance,
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.580]   but yet their experience was really different.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.380]   We helped them to move faster,
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.620]   burn calories at a higher rate, exercise more efficiently.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.700]   The amount of time they put in
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.760]   is gonna produce a better physical outcome.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.340]   And also it didn't hurt them.
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.380]   They're saying it doesn't hurt as much.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.540]   So we were really excited about that, right?
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.860]   Because it meant that this strategy,
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.940]   we could use it on people who are not elite athletes.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.460]   It could be easily adopted.
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.980]   A quick training session can teach people
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.060]   to look at the world in a different way.
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.360]   Again, this narrowed attention was different
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.920]   than whatever they do naturally, the comparison group,
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.340]   but it had a big outcome.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.860]   It had a big difference on the way
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.140]   that they were engaged in the exercise.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.900]   It was like some of the first work that we did
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.860]   and then since then we've done dozens more studies
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.340]   to look at, well, what happens with that
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.380]   and what else can we do with playing around with this?
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.700]   - Yeah, those are impressive differences
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.340]   as a consequence of narrowing visual attention.
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.060]   A couple of questions about the actual practice
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.420]   of narrowing attention.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:44.220]   Is there any indication of whether or not subjects
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.400]   are constantly updating their visual attention?
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.020]   So for instance, if let's say the goal line is in view,
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.420]   literally from the beginning,
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.220]   I could imagine just holding visual attention
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:00.220]   on the goal line, but if it's a oval track
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.940]   or it's a trajectory along a trail or through a city,
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.200]   how often do you think they are updating
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:11.140]   their visual aperture and setting a visual goal?
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:15.500]   And I could imagine that there's some energetic expense
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:20.300]   to that, meaning you wouldn't want to do every crack
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.320]   on the sidewalk unless those cracks on the sidewalk
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.680]   were very far apart, because I think at some point
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.660]   that itself would be exhausting.
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:32.660]   So is there an optimal strategy or a semi-optimal strategy?
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.400]   - Yeah, so those Olympic athletes
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.180]   that we started by interviewing, they tended to be sprinters.
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.640]   They were more often sprinters, short distance sprinters.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.700]   So when they said like, yes, I narrow in
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.440]   more than I assume an expansive focus,
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.740]   that's because they're not going that far, right?
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.800]   They have to do it as fast as humanly possible,
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.420]   but they're not going that far.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.580]   And so we started asking that question too about like,
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.160]   well, wouldn't that be tiring?
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.420]   And the answer is yes.
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.120]   So when we start to look at, well, people who aren't
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.940]   sprinters, who are accomplished, but who are more
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.140]   long distance runners, that's what we find that they do,
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:07.240]   is that they're using that narrowed attention strategy
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.800]   strategically and it increases in use.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.360]   They use it more often as the race progresses.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.060]   And they really start to do this major switch
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.780]   about the halfway point of say like a 10 kilometer run.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.260]   So people who are seasoned runners,
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.980]   they really start making a switch
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.700]   with what they're looking at about halfway through.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.100]   And that's where they more often, more frequently,
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.200]   and are more intentionally adopting a narrowed focus
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.220]   of attention when they're in the last couple miles of a run.
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.140]   When maybe their resources are starting to get more thin,
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.620]   maybe their motivation is starting to fade.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.180]   That tipping point in the middle is with any kind of goal
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.420]   where people struggle the most.
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.860]   And that's when they're like doubling down on a strategy
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.840]   that they know to be effective.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.520]   So, you know, at first, longer distance runners
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.860]   are not using that narrowed strategy.
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:59.620]   They're looking more expansively because I think that,
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.740]   well, first of all, distraction is a thing.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:02.580]   It's useful.
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.480]   Not necessarily that they're distracting themselves
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.580]   because people are still trying to hold pace
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.260]   and jostle among probably a more concentrated
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.660]   group of runners, but it is a strategy that they use
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.680]   and then sort of wean off of as the race goes through.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.540]   And it's particularly effective when we're looking
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.940]   for that last push, right?
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.560]   The last push to get over the finish line
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.240]   when like you might be literally neck and neck with somebody
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.180]   that you're trying to just beat out.
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.520]   Or when you're most tired, but you know,
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.420]   like that last push, you don't want to drop off.
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.200]   And you want to push through hard through that finish line.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.540]   That's when people are using it
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.080]   at its peak level of intensity.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:41.920]   - I see.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.120]   Yeah, to me, this makes total sense why it would work
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.400]   without going down the rabbit hole of visual neuroscience
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.040]   of something for another time.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.120]   When we do these vergence eye movements,
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.980]   when we bring our eyes to a visual target,
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.960]   it's clear that some of the brainstem circuitry
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.960]   for alertness gets engaged to a greater degree.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.960]   The other thing is that we know that when we focus
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.720]   on an object that the optics of the eye change
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.680]   and narrow the visual field.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.440]   So that brings about, this is a very detailed question,
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.760]   but I'm sure the audience is wondering.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.480]   Let's say I'm focused on a goal line
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.040]   or an intermediate goal.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.980]   Are they focusing on a specific point
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.540]   or is it kind of the entire horizon of that goal?
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.400]   Because the finish line is indeed a line.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.800]   So, and of course this is, it's impossible to know
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.480]   what someone is actually doing in their mind's eye,
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.740]   but how do people report this?
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.200]   Do they see it literally as a spotlight?
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.440]   And if so, how broad is that spot?
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.120]   - Yeah, so, you know, what is the length of their aperture
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:49.120]   rather than maybe the diameter or the sphere size of it?
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.600]   You know, in our interviews with people,
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.640]   our sort of focus group studies,
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.640]   it seems like it's more like a circular point.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.080]   And that's in fact what we're teaching people,
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.400]   what we're training them to do.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.680]   So rather than going broadly looking across a line
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.360]   from left to right, we are encouraging them
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.880]   to like imagine a circle of light
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.400]   that's shining on some target.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.240]   Now, of course the finish line is a line,
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.440]   but if they're staying in their lane,
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.480]   if they're on a track, right,
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.100]   you can imagine that there is a circle shining just on
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.020]   where in their lane they'll cross that finish line.
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.200]   Or if it's a stop sign,
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.960]   you could imagine a circle of light illuminating that.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.600]   So that's what we're teaching people to use.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.440]   And that's what seems to be effective
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:32.300]   to maintain that focus rather than sort of being pulled
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.960]   to engage with peripheral vision.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.920]   And there's some amazing people,
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.440]   some runners in history, like Joan Benoit Samuelson.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.320]   She's one of the first female marathon competitors
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.000]   who has won multiple marathons.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:46.840]   She's Canadian.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.320]   I think she's won, feel free to correct me,
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.340]   like 10 marathons in her life.
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:56.320]   And she talks about sort of not assuming this wide,
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:01.320]   but narrow, wide but not deep or tall attentional focus.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.240]   She talks about like finding the shorts
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.180]   on somebody ahead of me and focusing on those shorts
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.680]   until she passes them and then resetting that goal.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.240]   So in her interviews that she's done with runners magazines,
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.340]   she talks about it in terms of this circle of attention.
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:21.320]   - I think I've experienced this a little bit
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.000]   because we're visiting New York now to do this interview
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.200]   and runners here seem more competitive.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.020]   The recreational runners here seem more competitive.
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.880]   People walking on the street seem competitive.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.760]   You're walking at near pace to somebody,
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.880]   they'll quickly speed up.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.560]   If you speed up, they'll speed up.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.600]   I think there've been some studies about walking speed
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.680]   in different cities and New York ranks
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.220]   among the fastest walkers around.
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.160]   I won't mention the slowest walking cities
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.420]   'cause we don't want to cast any judgements.
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.420]   But fascinating.
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.680]   And again, makes total sense based on the way
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.700]   the visual system measures both space and time,
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.940]   something maybe we'll get into a little bit later.
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.800]   But I'm curious whether or not this,
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.000]   the whole thing works in reverse as well.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Meaning do people who are very motivated to exercise,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.920]   do they think this way naturally?
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.940]   People who are averse to exercise
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.720]   or who find it hard to get motivated to exercise,
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.920]   do they view the world differently, literally?
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.600]   - Yeah, I have so much that I can say about this.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.200]   So if you'll humor me,
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.320]   I'll give you a couple of different stories
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.800]   about how we can answer that.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.760]   So you don't have to do a deep dive into vision science,
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.440]   which of course you are capable of doing.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.960]   But what I can share with you is some animal studies
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.480]   where this work kind of first started.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.880]   This is in the 1940s, 1950s, rat labs, mice labs.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.060]   And they were looking,
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:53.300]   those were the first models of human behavior
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.560]   that people were trying to understand motivation,
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.620]   motivation science within.
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:02.120]   So they would deprive these poor rats and mice
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:06.280]   of food or water so that they were motivated to get it.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.360]   They were hungry and they were thirsty
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.200]   and they had practice running a maze
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.120]   so they knew where they could find that food or water
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.020]   or whatever that they were looking for.
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.520]   And what these researchers were studying
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.440]   was the pace of movement through the maze.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.160]   So as the rats were going through the maze,
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.280]   they found that even though these rats were hungry
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:32.280]   and they're having to expend limited caloric energy
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.880]   to make it to the finish line,
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.020]   they actually ran faster the closer they got
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:37.240]   to that finish line.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.320]   So once that finish line became nearer to them,
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.400]   they actually use their resources probably sub-optimally
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.800]   to make sure that they crossed the finish line
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.320]   and got their reward.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.200]   So that was like some of the first early work
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.280]   that was showing that proximity to a goal
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.040]   increases the investment in resources
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.880]   that animals use to meet that goal,
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.800]   even when they don't have that much to spare.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.280]   And with the mice, the same kind of thing,
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.200]   they actually had these little harnesses on them.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.080]   They were looking at how hard did the mice pull
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.980]   to try to make it to the food or the water
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.400]   that they were trying to get.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.800]   And same deal, the closer they got to getting their reward,
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.560]   the harder they were pulling,
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.840]   even though they didn't have that much energy to spare
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.560]   and they had already used some up
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.720]   getting to that finish line.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:30.720]   So that early animal research from the 1940s, 1950s
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.200]   then spurred a whole wave of work in humans.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.600]   Do humans do the same thing?
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.120]   Even when they're tired, but they can see
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.500]   or they can feel that their goal is close,
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.920]   do they double down and work even harder
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.280]   to cross that finish line?
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.760]   Either like a literal finish line
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.860]   if we're talking about exercise
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.120]   or a metaphorical finish line
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.680]   if we're talking about any other kind of goal
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.800]   that people might have.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.040]   And the answer is yes.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.520]   They called that the goal gradient hypothesis.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.440]   The closer you get to the goal,
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.800]   generally the harder people and animals work
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.340]   to finish that goal.
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:03.320]   That's what led us then to think, okay,
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.000]   those rats, those mice, those people
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.120]   are seeing a finish line, right?
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.280]   And it's when they're maybe seeing that finish line,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.280]   seeing that reward,
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.360]   seeing the goal they're hoping to accomplish,
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.200]   that is what's leading them to try harder,
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.720]   to invest more so that they can finish it off.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.080]   What if we induce that illusion of proximity?
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.720]   What if we can induce a visual illusion,
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.920]   a visual experience that approximates
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:31.240]   what the real rats and mice were actually experiencing
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.980]   as they got closer?
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.280]   So that is what is happening.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.480]   That's what's happening visually
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.780]   when we create that narrowed focus of attention.
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.560]   When we tell people, imagine there's a spotlight
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.040]   on the shorts of the person up ahead
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.880]   or the stop sign that you're seeing,
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.840]   it induces an illusion of proximity
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.600]   that then is responsible for people trying harder,
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.680]   walking faster, feeling that it defied their expectations
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.880]   and that it wasn't as bad as they thought it would be.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.460]   So we do things like measure,
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:00.280]   like measure their visual experience.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.320]   How far away is that finish line?
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.120]   Of course, we can ask them to report in feet.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.760]   How many feet is it?
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.800]   Oh, but that's challenging, right?
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.960]   Like nobody really knows what three feet
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.200]   versus four feet really looks like, but they do.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.600]   So we can ask them how many feet it is.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.960]   We also use these other measures
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.060]   of visual matching measures to know
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.440]   that distance of the finish line looks about as far away
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.320]   as this other target.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.560]   They're matching up their visual experiences.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.040]   So what we know is that inducing that narrowed focus
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.120]   of attention is creating an illusion of proximity.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.320]   That goal looks closer to them.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.120]   And then there's all kinds of downstream motivational
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.660]   and psychological effects that happen
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.820]   from feeling like you're closer.
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:43.220]   By visually misperceiving that space,
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:45.680]   it can have a really positive consequence.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.960]   So your first question was, you know, which way does it go?
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.840]   Does it go both ways that people who are better runners
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.600]   like happen to do this thing?
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.920]   Yes, some of our research shows that,
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.960]   that if they, you know, for whatever reason happened
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.200]   upon this strategy and continued to practice it,
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.180]   they tended to be the better runners.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.800]   But we also know from our experiments in the lab,
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.480]   where we take people who don't know about these strategies
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.960]   and buy a flip of the coin,
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:15.040]   we randomly assign them to either learn the strategy
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.600]   and use it or do whatever comes naturally to them,
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.560]   we can create that illusion of proximity
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.520]   that has a direct and causal impact
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.820]   on improving the performance when they're exercising.
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:29.280]   So yes, it goes both ways,
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.000]   but you can also teach yourself
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.200]   that you don't have to just rely on luck,
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.840]   luck of the draw for being a person
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.740]   who happens to be better at exercising
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.420]   or whose eyes happen to do this on their own.
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.160]   - Before we continue with today's discussion,
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.760]   we're going to take a brief pause
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.280]   to acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens,
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.040]   also called AG1.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.320]   I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.760]   So I'm delighted that they've been a sponsor of this podcast.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.560]   Athletic Greens contains vitamins, minerals, probiotics,
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.280]   digestive enzymes, and adaptogens.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.600]   So it's got a lot of things in there.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.240]   That's actually the reason I started taking it
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.920]   and the reason I still take it once or twice a day.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.040]   It essentially covers all of my nutritional bases
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.280]   and the probiotics in particular are important to me
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.600]   because of the critical importance
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.200]   of what's called the gut brain axis,
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.440]   that is neurons and other cell types in the gut,
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.000]   in the digestive tract that communicate with the brain
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.240]   and the brain back to the digestive tract
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.640]   in order to control things like mood, immune function,
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.600]   hormone function, and on and on.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.040]   Whenever somebody has asked me
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.220]   what's the one supplement they should take,
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:30.860]   I always answer Athletic Greens.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.240]   I gave that answer long before I ever had this podcast
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.020]   and it's the answer I still give now
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.800]   for all the reasons that I detailed just a moment ago.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.180]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:42.040]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.160]   to claim a special offer.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.560]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.320]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.340]   while you're on the road,
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:50.160]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2,
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.360]   which are also very important for a huge number
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.480]   of bodily factors and brain factors
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.360]   that impact your immediate and long-term health.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.000]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.660]   to claim that special offer.
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.320]   The most pressing question I have in my mind is,
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:08.320]   can we, I, all of us use this strategy
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.120]   to make the starting line a goal point?
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.460]   Because for a lot of people,
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.520]   it's not about going from start to finish,
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.920]   it's about getting to start.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:22.400]   And I would say here I'm estimating,
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:27.400]   but 15% of the content on social media is about motivation
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.240]   and how to get motivated to do things.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.120]   Neurochemicals like dopamine, of course,
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.920]   being at the heart of motivation,
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.680]   in my mind, I'm making strong links
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.520]   between some of these visual aperture effects
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:43.640]   and goal lines and dopamine that we could also dive into.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.320]   But the simple question is,
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.600]   can I use this finish line strategy
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.660]   to make the start line a goal
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:56.220]   and get my system more engaged or motivated?
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:00.160]   And is there any physiology or physiological changes
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.180]   I should say to reflect the idea
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.160]   that maybe just visually focusing on the start line
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.640]   would actually get me more excited
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:11.280]   as opposed to make me less excited to engage in effort?
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.320]   - There's certainly vision science that's tied up
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:16.840]   in that very first stage of goal setting,
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.080]   like identifying what that goal is in the first place
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.320]   and taking those first steps.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:24.100]   A lot of people's go-to strategies that involve vision
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:28.640]   are vision boards or dream boards or post-it notes, right?
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.580]   They're creating some sort of visual representation
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.800]   of what it is that they want to accomplish.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.460]   Where is it that I want to be in five years, 10 days,
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.800]   10 years, whatever that timeline is
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.440]   that they're working under.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.280]   The idea of vision boards or dream boards
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:46.760]   is that you almost like a scrapbook collect visual icons
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.120]   that reflect where you want to be to motivate yourself.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.720]   It's a really common tactic that people use.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.500]   And it's not bad to do that, right?
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.080]   For some people, just even knowing what they want in life
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.320]   is a major accomplishment.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.360]   And defining the goal can be really challenging for people.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.980]   And that's a strategy that works
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.560]   and involves our visual experience, right?
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.040]   It's not just, people aren't saying like,
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.080]   why don't you just sit around and imagine
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.320]   what you want your life to be like in 10 years?
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.720]   The strategy that people are suggesting is like,
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.400]   no, cut out the pictures, put it on a board
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.240]   and stick it by your bathroom mirror
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.560]   so you see it every day, right?
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.400]   - Or make a list.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.240]   - Or make a list, yeah.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.640]   - People are big on these lists.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.480]   I have a lot of friends who are like,
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.480]   have you made your list, right?
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.560]   The list of things that you insist on having
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.260]   in the context of fitness, relationship, job,
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.100]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.440]   This seems more and more common.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.280]   - Yeah, totally.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.340]   And the idea, like write it down, right?
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.840]   They're telling you write it down
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.520]   or create a visual manifestation of it.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.600]   And so, yeah, that's effective
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.760]   for identifying what you want,
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.640]   but it may not actually be effective
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.860]   for helping you to meet the goal, to get the job done.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.360]   So colleagues of mine at New York University
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.520]   have probed why, why is that?
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.900]   Why is just thinking about what you want in your life
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:04.440]   and sort of putting yourself vicariously into those shoes,
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.980]   imagining what my life will be like
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:09.240]   if I can accomplish everything on this list.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.320]   Why doesn't that work?
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.340]   Well, first of all, does it work?
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.180]   The answer is no.
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.020]   And why does it not work?
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.280]   Because what happens, these colleagues,
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:21.080]   Gabrielle Otenjin and her research team have found,
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:24.320]   is that going through and dreaming about
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.320]   or visualizing how great my life will be
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.280]   when I get X, Y, and Z done,
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:34.180]   that is like a goal satisfied.
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:36.080]   I have identified what it is that I want.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:40.360]   I have experienced it, even if just in an imaginary way,
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.400]   I've had that positive experience of thinking about
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.440]   how great my life is gonna be when I get this thing done.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.900]   And they start to sort of rest on their laurels.
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.800]   She's actually measured systolic blood pressure
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.880]   and heart rate.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.240]   And they found that people who do that,
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.280]   who go through that experience of visualizing
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.120]   how great my life will be when I get X, Y, and Z done,
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.400]   their systolic blood pressure,
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.680]   bottom number on your blood pressure reading, decreases.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.360]   Okay, now I'm all about finding ways to relax,
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.520]   especially in New York, right?
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.160]   You're constantly living at a high level of stimulation.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.300]   And so like, cool, great.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.560]   So maybe I should just like think about
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.560]   how awesome my life will be
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.440]   when I get my bucket list done.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.680]   But motivation scientists know that systolic blood pressure
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.040]   is actually an indicator of our body's readiness
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.660]   to get up and act, to do something.
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.400]   Now that can be the going out for a walk,
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.640]   going out for a run, hitting the gym.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.840]   It can also be things like doing math problems, right?
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.160]   Even if it's something that's just mental systolic,
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.920]   blood pressure actually goes up in anticipation
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.840]   of your body or your mind needing to do something,
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.280]   taking the first steps on a goal.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:50.520]   So then it helps us to understand of like,
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.700]   okay, if I've just created this dream board,
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.860]   this vision board, and put myself psychologically
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.080]   in that space of a goal satisfied,
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.840]   why is it bad that blood pressure goes down?
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.960]   Because it means your body is chilling out.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.360]   It's like, all right, cool.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.600]   I just accomplished something pretty major.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.800]   I'd actually now don't have the physiological resources
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.240]   at the ready to take the first step right now
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.080]   to do something about that.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:16.200]   So that was a pretty monumental finding
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.000]   for motivation scientists to understand
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.280]   that like creating these dream boards,
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.440]   these vision boards or to-do lists might actually backfire
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:26.640]   because it in and of itself is the creation of a goal
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.280]   and the satisfaction of the goal.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.000]   And then people understandably give themselves some time
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.960]   to just enjoy that positive experience.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.680]   - So much for the secret.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.560]   - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.600]   - I guess now the secret folks will come after me
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.440]   with pitchforks, but-
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.560]   - I try to never say the name, right?
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.600]   - Well, I'm not afraid to say the name.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.920]   I mean, I imagine that certain strategies
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.820]   might work for other people,
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.140]   but everything you're saying, again,
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:51.580]   is consistent with what we know about the physiology
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:53.360]   of dopamine circuits for motivation.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.880]   I have a good friend who perhaps incidentally,
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.740]   perhaps not, is a cardiologist at a major university,
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:04.640]   said that one of the major errors that people make
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:08.040]   with book writing and completion is they will tell people
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.400]   they're going to write a book and people will say,
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.920]   "Oh, you definitely should write a book.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.120]   Everyone's going to love your book."
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.460]   And they never end up writing it.
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.320]   And his theory is that they get so much dopamine reward
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.840]   from that immediate feedback with all the protection
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.720]   of never having the book criticized,
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.120]   that they never write the book.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.580]   I'm sure there are exceptions to this,
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.120]   but I guess it raises the question,
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.460]   what's the better strategy?
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.720]   - Yeah, so I'm not saying that people who enjoy
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.380]   a dream board creation should stop what they're doing.
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.720]   That's not the take-home message here.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.040]   - Nightmare board?
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.440]   - Oh, definitely not that, no.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.300]   There's enough anxiety and fear in the world.
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.440]   We don't need to encourage more of it.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.200]   But the process of goal setting shouldn't stop
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.100]   with articulating what the goal is.
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:50.700]   So at that same point that we're trying to figure out
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:51.540]   what do we want to do?
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.940]   What is my vision for the future?
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.800]   In those planning sessions,
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.360]   we need to simultaneously think about a couple other things.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.800]   One is how are we going to get there?
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.520]   So take it out of the abstract,
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.200]   take it out of this idyllic visual iconography,
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.160]   and start thinking about the practical day-to-day.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.920]   We need to break it down into more manageable goals,
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.480]   not just my 10-year plan for myself, but my two-week plan.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.500]   What can I accomplish in the next two weeks
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.760]   and the two weeks after?
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.200]   That's going to set me on the right trajectory.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.720]   That's probably not surprising to anybody
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.080]   who's been thinking about how do I set goals better?
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.240]   Plan big picture, think big picture abstractly,
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.680]   but then also break it down more concretely.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.780]   That's probably not surprising,
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:36.960]   but it's an important aspect of the goal setting process.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.980]   Then again, Gabrielle Otenjen in my department
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.620]   has identified a third often overlooked
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.320]   or underappreciated stage that has to happen
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.520]   at that goal in the goal setting process.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.220]   And that's thinking about the obstacles
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:52.080]   that stand in your way of success.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.920]   And that will actually help improve motivation
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.200]   in the long run.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.980]   And sometimes people think that that is counterintuitive.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:01.600]   You're saying like, if I want to increase my motivation,
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:02.440]   have more motivation,
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.200]   then I need to think about how hard it's going to be,
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.920]   all the ways that I'm going to fail.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.880]   How is that going to like jazz me up?
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.240]   How's that going to help me get through
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.520]   when I actually, you know, when things get hard?
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.500]   But it does, because it's like coming up with a plan B,
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.660]   a plan C, plan D, in advance of actually experiencing that.
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.020]   If you were on a boat and the boat started to sink,
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.700]   that's not the time you want to start looking
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.020]   for life jackets.
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.140]   You already want to know where one is
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.140]   so you can go to it right away.
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.340]   And it's the same thing with goal setting,
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:34.260]   is that you want to know, what am I working towards?
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.140]   How am I going to get there?
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.480]   And if I experience this obstacle,
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.060]   here's what I'm going to do about it.
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:41.060]   You may never experience that obstacle,
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.700]   but if you do, you're probably going to be shy on time,
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.720]   thin on resources, maybe experiencing an anxiety
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.980]   that hijacks your brain so you're not functioning
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.620]   at that optimal level of judgment and decision-making,
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:55.820]   you want to already have like the snap next step in place
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:58.020]   so you can just hop to it, right?
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.220]   We're not going to do our best thinking
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.560]   when we're in crisis mode, but we don't have to
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.640]   if we have used, if we have already used our resources
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.640]   in advance to come up with that plan B or that plan C.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.160]   Michael Phelps, like incredible athlete, right?
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.620]   This is something that he and his coach
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:16.560]   have routinely incorporated into their training.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.520]   So I love this story that like back in 2008,
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.640]   he was, you know, hot for the first time
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:24.360]   on the international stage, it was the Beijing Olympics.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.120]   Michael Phelps was on the brink of doing something
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.600]   that no one else in the history of the Olympic games
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:30.720]   has ever done, which is win eight gold medals
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.800]   in a single Olympiad.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.640]   At the time of this story, he had already won seven
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.800]   and he had just the 200 fly in front of him
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.080]   before he could do what no one else has ever done,
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.960]   win the eighth gold medal.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.000]   And like the fly is his thing, right?
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.620]   This should have been, this should have been easy,
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.160]   like a no brainer, he's gonna win this,
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.280]   he's gonna break Olympic history.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:51.480]   As soon as he dove into the pool,
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.280]   his goggles started to leak.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.360]   And by the time he had done three lengths of the pool,
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.320]   he just had to flip around and come back
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.840]   to the starting line slash finish line, back to the edge.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:05.020]   By the time that happened, his goggles were completely
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.240]   filled with water and he was swimming blind.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.440]   I would have panicked, I would have sunk
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.720]   to the bottom of the pool.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.400]   I wouldn't have even been in the pool, to be honest.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.840]   Like I'm not a swimmer, definitely not gonna be
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.400]   in the Olympics, but for him, he didn't.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.220]   It wasn't a moment of panic, like it probably
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.900]   would have been for nearly every other person
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.340]   in that situation because he had foreshadowed
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.060]   that kind of possible failure.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.860]   He had imagined that obstacle hitting him in advance
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:28.960]   and not even just imagined it, but practiced it.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.080]   What will we do?
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.480]   He routinely practiced swimming with his goggles
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.100]   not fully secured on his face.
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.960]   His coach notoriously would rip the goggles off of his head,
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.020]   smash them on the ground for maybe dramatic effect
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.880]   or something so that he didn't even have any goggles
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.060]   possible to grab as he's in practice.
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.500]   So because he had foreshadowed that possibility
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:50.580]   and the solution, if my goggles start to leak,
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:54.840]   then I will do, in his case, start counting my strokes,
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:55.780]   then I'll make it through.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.540]   He knew exactly how many strokes it would take
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.540]   for him to get from one end of the pool to the other.
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.920]   He started counting his strokes, he won that race,
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.540]   the 200 fly, he won his eighth gold medal
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:07.240]   and he'd go on to win 15 more in his career.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:10.120]   So we might not all be swimmers, we might not all aspire
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:13.040]   to Olympic level performance, but I love that example
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.280]   because I think it helps sort of demystify
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.700]   or give us an alternative perspective on the importance
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.200]   and the motivational reasons why.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.980]   Thinking about obstacles in advance,
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.740]   thinking about the ways, the two, three, four ways
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:29.880]   that your plan might go awry is actually effective
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.440]   at helping us to overcome the obstacle
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.360]   that might otherwise lead us to throw in the towel.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.960]   - That's a beautiful example.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.340]   I'm going to springboard off that example
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:42.800]   to ask a question that has also been on my mind,
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.080]   which is, is there really anything special about vision?
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.720]   Because in the example you just gave,
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:50.980]   it was indeed vision that Michael Phelps was deprived of
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.960]   and it was counting strokes.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.960]   Counting is another form of incremental measurement
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.860]   in the nervous system, obviously.
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:02.520]   There are others that could be the sensation
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.680]   of the hands smacking the water
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.960]   or breaking the surface of the water.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.860]   So there are any number of different variables
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.280]   or metrics that one could use.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.040]   I could imagine that setting out on a,
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.720]   let's say a three mile run,
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.760]   which for me is a decent distance run.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.060]   It's one I do a few times a week.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.360]   I'm also not a runner, but I try and complete some runs
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:25.520]   a few times a week at very slow pace just for my health.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.760]   I could count every step.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.360]   That would be kind of exhausting.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:34.000]   But if I knew that three miles was,
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.260]   I'm going to estimate here, I don't know,
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:38.680]   a couple thousand steps, I could count backward.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:39.660]   I could count forward.
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:43.740]   I count every 10, I confess I spend every morning
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:45.460]   trying to find sunlight to get sun in my eyes
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.400]   to set my circadian rhythm and I do a hundred jumping jacks.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.040]   So I'm the guy that people are looking at strange
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.200]   on the street, but sometimes I count every 10,
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.940]   sometimes I count backwards, sometimes I count forward.
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.640]   Is there any indication that it matters
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:01.420]   or is it simply that we attach some sort of meaning
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:06.420]   to that increment and the mode of reaching that increment?
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:09.060]   Because it does seem like there's something special
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.620]   about vision and we could maybe dive into a little bit more
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.200]   of why that is, but at a very basic level,
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:18.960]   how broadly or finally should one set the increments
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.100]   and does it matter if you're counting steps
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.080]   or counting strokes, if you're,
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.100]   maybe it's every other song,
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.260]   you're going to listen to an entire album.
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:29.240]   That's something that I don't know if people do anymore,
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.880]   or you're going to listen to a whole playlist
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.920]   and then listen to it again and you're going to run
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:37.060]   as long as the playlist is completed twice.
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.780]   You can obviously see what I'm getting at,
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:41.080]   but I know people are going to want to implement these tools
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.740]   and I have to guess that the nervous system
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:46.300]   is somewhat indiscriminate when it comes to these things,
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:49.020]   but that there might also be some specificity.
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.300]   - I think vision is special and I think you do too.
[00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.940]   So, and for a variety of reasons.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.480]   When you start, you can really nerd out
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.120]   on how cool the brain is and how cool vision is
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.820]   within the brain and when you do,
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:01.860]   then you start to find some things
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.640]   that make vision unique, right?
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:07.460]   More real estate, more neurological cortex,
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:09.780]   real estate is taken up by the visual sense
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:14.580]   than any other sense, more than taste, touch, smell, right?
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.360]   Vision gets more real estate,
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.620]   gets more neurological processing space
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:19.720]   than any other sense.
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.560]   Why is that?
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.760]   Well, because evolution has led us to prioritize
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.780]   that visual, the visual experience.
[00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.660]   There's some cool illusions where like maybe somebody's mouth
[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:31.000]   is doing something different than what you're hearing
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.620]   when people start to create these like, you know,
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:36.540]   weird tricks that might go on YouTube and go viral.
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:39.460]   And people are trying to figure out, what did I hear?
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.540]   What did I see his mouth doing?
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:44.780]   And what comes up is that people prioritize what they see
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.340]   over what they're hearing when the two are incompatible
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:48.660]   or kind of like out of sync.
[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:49.500]   - Every time.
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.660]   - Yeah, every time, right?
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.000]   If you had to bet on it, bet on what it is
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.380]   that you're looking at rather than what you're seeing.
[00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:56.740]   Why is that?
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:58.460]   Well, I guess a couple other things too, right?
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:49:59.700]   Like we can see super far.
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:02.540]   You can see like a flickering candle on our horizon
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:05.980]   if it was a totally, you know, clear sky.
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:07.300]   Several miles away you can see
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:09.240]   the International Space Station floating up
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.100]   in the night sky, right?
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.920]   Like hundreds of miles away.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:14.860]   Our eyes are amazing.
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:19.420]   And we prioritize what we see that,
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.440]   and I think that's because we never,
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.260]   we rarely get the experience
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:26.260]   of having our visual experience second guessed.
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:28.240]   You know, oftentimes we're having conversation
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.420]   maybe in a loud restaurant
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.980]   and we know that we didn't hear the person right.
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:32.340]   And so we say like, oh, did you say that?
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.820]   Or like, oh, I thought you said this.
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:34.980]   And they're like, no, I didn't say that, right?
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:39.420]   So people will correct us when our ears get it wrong
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:41.620]   or we're tasting something amazing
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:43.980]   and we can't quite figure out what spices were in here.
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:45.580]   And so we know that our tongue
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:48.820]   isn't quite picking up the taste the right way.
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:49.900]   And that's why we read the menu
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:51.060]   to see what are the ingredients.
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.740]   Or we ask the chef, like, what did you put in this?
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:54.620]   It tastes amazing.
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.260]   So we know that our tongue is getting it wrong.
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.940]   Or you might be touching something
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:00.180]   and you look at the tag to see what sort of textile
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:02.260]   was used in this really amazing piece of clothing
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:03.460]   that you're looking to buy.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.420]   So we know that our sense of touch
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:06.740]   isn't quite getting it right.
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.380]   But rarely do we have that experience
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:11.340]   of having our eyes get updated.
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:12.460]   Where we're looking at something,
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.620]   oh, I think I'm looking at my mom.
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.900]   Oh, no, actually it was actually my husband.
[00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:17.940]   Okay, like that never happens, right?
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.620]   That we have gotten vision as wrong
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:21.620]   as we might get any other thing
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:24.800]   that we're experiencing through any other sense.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.900]   We trust our visual experience.
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.900]   We have sort of a naive realism
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:32.860]   that what we see reflects the world the way it actually is.
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.280]   Because it's never really fully tested.
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.940]   We never get the input or the feedback
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:40.080]   that you've seen something wrong.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.700]   Until a visual illusion pops up on social media, right?
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:46.140]   Like the dress example or the last week or so
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:48.740]   there's been that horse seal line drawing
[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:50.320]   that's been all over social media too.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.160]   What do you see?
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:51.980]   I see a horse.
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:52.820]   Someone says, I see a seal.
[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:54.160]   And then like, you know, chaos erupts.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.100]   Or I thought the dress was blue
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.860]   and I thought it was gold.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:59.740]   I don't remember the options 'cause I see it as blue.
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:01.660]   So, right?
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:04.180]   And it's like dividing up families and friendships
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.580]   because you've like seen something
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:08.100]   that the other person just literally cannot see.
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.340]   And that's why we love those examples
[00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:13.140]   when they pop up in social media when they do.
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:16.740]   Is because it defies all of our previous expectations.
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:19.820]   There's a really amazing, if this interests you,
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:22.120]   there's a really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor,
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.640]   who plays with these ideas too.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.940]   And his installations are just fascinating.
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:29.220]   I saw one at a museum once
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.380]   where I walked down this long hall
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.220]   and it's just a big black rectangle
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:34.620]   that's painted on the wall.
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:36.300]   And I was like, this guy's super famous.
[00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:37.140]   What the hell?
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:40.220]   It's just a big black rectangle painted on the wall.
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.180]   What is this about?
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:42.500]   Like, what a hoax.
[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:44.040]   You know, this museum paid how much?
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.500]   What, whatever.
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.400]   But then as you get closer,
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.540]   you get closer and your eyes start to settle in
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:50.300]   and they adapt to the different visual lighting.
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.260]   You realize it's not a black square painted on the wall.
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:54.500]   It's a huge hole he's carved into the wall.
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.300]   And there is a whole other world that's back behind there
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:59.220]   that you can't see right away
[00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:02.180]   until your eyes adapt to the different lighting conditions.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:03.000]   - Beautiful.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:03.840]   - It's amazing.
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.580]   - As a vision scientist, I have to see,
[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:06.760]   where is this exhibit?
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:07.900]   - It's not up right now.
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:11.020]   I've seen, there was a retrospective several years ago
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:13.380]   that was done in Sydney,
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.840]   but his work is all over the place.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:17.620]   So Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:20.380]   because like the dress example
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:21.780]   or the horse seal line drawing
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:24.240]   or artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.340]   that is a moment that gives us a different,
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:30.180]   unexpected insight about the world,
[00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:32.520]   that it challenges us to see something
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:33.660]   that we hadn't seen before
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.960]   or it induces or tricks us into seeing something
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.220]   that we wouldn't have otherwise have seen.
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.880]   And so it's those rare moments
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.800]   that I think are actually really important
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:44.860]   for understanding what do our eyes normally do
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.540]   because we wouldn't find these examples so surprising,
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:49.100]   so engaging, so shocking
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.960]   if we had routinely gotten the experience
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:53.580]   of realizing we're not seeing the world the way that it is.
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:57.740]   So that is why I think vision is special
[00:53:57.740 --> 00:54:00.320]   and why it can be thought of as a tool
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:02.600]   that we can add to our toolkit
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:04.980]   for how to better accomplish our goals.
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:06.880]   I'm not saying that we should just only focus
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:10.860]   on imagining the world through an attentional spotlight,
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:14.060]   but maybe that's something that we can employ strategically
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:16.820]   on occasion when we think it's gonna best help us,
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.140]   when we need an extra little push
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:21.700]   to cross the literal or metaphorical finish line,
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:24.620]   but it doesn't have to be the only tactic that we use.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.460]   Just like it's not bad to use vision boards,
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.300]   but let's use something else also.
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:31.460]   It's not bad to talk to ourselves in encouraging ways,
[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:35.380]   but let's try adding another tool to our tool belt
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:38.660]   in case that's not enough to get the job done.
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:40.420]   So I do think that there's great power
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:42.360]   in thinking about our visual experience
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.980]   alongside other tactics that we might use
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:46.500]   for meeting our goals.
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.100]   And another one of those tactics might be like
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:50.100]   the numerics that you're talking about.
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:52.540]   How do I think about my jumping jacks
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:56.020]   in terms of groups of 10 or as a set of 100?
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:57.140]   You do it routinely.
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:59.120]   So you might be able to set a goal of 100
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:03.100]   and have that sustain you through number 60, number 70,
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:04.900]   when maybe it's starting to get harder.
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.420]   But for somebody who's just starting out
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:08.180]   and wants to be able to make it to 100,
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:09.220]   that's probably not gonna work.
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:10.620]   That's gonna be maybe really,
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.040]   that could be quite challenging for them
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.960]   if it's the first time that they're trying it.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:17.740]   And so instead, setting those micro goals of groups of 10
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:20.640]   is gonna be useful because as we start to get to number eight
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:25.180]   or nine or number 88 or 89 and it's really getting hard,
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:28.340]   we need that extra little hedonic hit of pleasure,
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:31.220]   of accomplishment, the micro dopamine rush
[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:36.220]   that you might get by hitting another decade milestone,
[00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:39.020]   another group of 10 milestone.
[00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:40.700]   And once we get that little hit of pleasure,
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.220]   excitement or self-congratulations,
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:44.620]   that might be enough to sustain us
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:47.160]   through the next challenging physical obstacle,
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.820]   the next group of 10 that we might experience.
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:52.500]   So there isn't any prescription that I would give
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.300]   and say every person should decide
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:56.920]   that 25 jumping jacks is the goal.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:00.140]   No, we have to be idiosyncratic and introspect
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:01.620]   about where are we at with this goal,
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:03.500]   this thing that I'm trying to accomplish,
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:06.540]   and set those goals realistically
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:08.460]   but inspirationally as well.
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:10.780]   We wanna set a goal that will challenge us
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.600]   but isn't impossible.
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:14.580]   We don't wanna set goals that are too easy
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.340]   because we're not gonna trick ourselves
[00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:20.340]   into like feeling so great about doing one jumping jack.
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:23.260]   Okay, great, like pretty sure most people,
[00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:25.220]   if that's a goal, they can do one.
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:27.480]   So are you gonna feel so great when you hit that goal?
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.080]   No, because it was too easy.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:32.200]   You didn't have any doubt that you could do that one.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.720]   But what about 25?
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:37.320]   Okay, yeah, I might feel pretty good about that.
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:40.080]   Well, what about the next group of 25 and now I'm at 50?
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:42.120]   Those are goals that might seem just beyond the brink
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:44.860]   of what's possible but I will feel good when I hit that
[00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:47.260]   and that's gonna give me the next sort of boost of energy
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:48.940]   that I'm gonna need to go a little bit further,
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:51.260]   either that time or the next time.
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:53.180]   - Yeah, I think vision is special.
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.860]   Again, I'm strongly biased here.
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:57:00.780]   The reason I initially learned about your work was,
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:02.220]   well, now you have this amazing book,
[00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:04.060]   but at the time there wasn't the book,
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:06.060]   there were just the scientific papers
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:08.780]   and of course upon which the book rests
[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:12.580]   and those papers are really important.
[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:15.220]   But the relationship between vision
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:16.980]   and obviously is our sense of space,
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:19.340]   but how the sense of space and time are related.
[00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:23.420]   And to make the idea quite simple for those listening,
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.100]   you know, when you narrow your visual window,
[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:29.740]   you're measuring the time bin also gets smaller, right?
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:31.180]   Which makes sense when you hear it.
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:33.900]   Whereas if you take on a huge visual landscape,
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:35.480]   you're actually carving up time differently.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:38.780]   It's sort of like moving from a slow frame rate
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:40.140]   to a fine frame rate.
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:42.860]   You know, slow motion camera is actually taking
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:44.460]   a lot more snapshots, right?
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:47.060]   So you're measuring distance over time more finely.
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.580]   And so where a strobe would be the other example,
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.820]   which is strobe is very low frequency.
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:53.300]   So you're going here, here, here,
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:55.180]   as opposed to, you know, slow motion, right?
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:58:00.180]   Strobe gives a course view into the time domain
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.420]   and high speed photography gives a fine view
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:03.500]   in the time domain.
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.720]   So I'm almost certain without any knowledge
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.800]   of underlying data,
[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:13.060]   but knowledge of the mechanism then I am almost certain,
[00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:17.240]   if not certain that by placing a narrow visual aperture,
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.680]   we change the way we perceive time.
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:22.140]   Now I have a question and to be honest,
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:23.280]   I know the answer in advance,
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:26.640]   but I'd love for you to tell us a bit about
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:31.060]   how some of this works still further in reverse,
[00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:34.540]   meaning how unfit people view the world
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:36.540]   versus how fit people view the world
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:40.220]   or how unmotivated people visually see the world
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:43.180]   as opposed to highly motivated people.
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:45.280]   You talked about these elite runners,
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.800]   you give them Michael Phelps example,
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:49.320]   but maybe you could describe that study.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:51.420]   I think it's a particularly important one,
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:56.020]   mostly because yes, it identifies perhaps a physiological
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:57.980]   or psychological differences between motivated
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:01.080]   and unmotivated or fit and unfit people,
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:04.900]   but it also provides a path to remedy that.
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:08.700]   - Yeah, so out of my lab,
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.500]   but also out of several other labs,
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:12.740]   there's been work looking at that relation
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:16.200]   between states of the body and visual experiences.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.520]   They haven't necessarily tried
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:21.780]   to integrate the motivation science element to it,
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:25.100]   but they were looking to see the visual experiences change
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:27.140]   as a function of different states of our body.
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:30.300]   So they've looked at people who experienced chronic fatigue,
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:33.260]   the elderly, people who are overweight,
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:36.860]   those that are wearing heavy backpacks
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:39.040]   and so who are sort of put into that experience
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.140]   of being overweight,
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:42.560]   what happens to their perceptions of the environment?
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:45.400]   Well, what they find is that distances look further
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:47.240]   to those that are overweight, chronically tired,
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:50.600]   older rather than younger, weighted down with extra baggage,
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:54.800]   distances look farther and hills look steeper.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.920]   We've done some of those studies too,
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.400]   where we try to like give people more energy
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.960]   or deprive them of energy
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.980]   and see does that change their perception of space.
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:09.260]   And we did that by sort of a classic technique
[01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:10.920]   of a double blind study
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.420]   where the participant doesn't really know
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.780]   what they're experiencing.
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:15.660]   - I thought you were gonna say a double espresso.
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:16.900]   (laughing)
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.840]   - That is also a good psychological experience
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.020]   to give people.
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:24.500]   Yeah, so a double blind experiment
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.180]   where the participant doesn't really know
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:28.320]   the full extent of what they're doing
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.360]   or what they're experiencing
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.240]   and the researcher who's interacting with them
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.440]   also doesn't.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.300]   They do this a lot in medical studies.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:35.840]   You give somebody a drug
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.620]   and you give somebody a placebo, a sugar pill,
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:42.080]   and then importantly, nobody really knows who's got what
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.720]   until you've analyzed all the data
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.720]   and the results are revealed
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.960]   that these are the people that had the drug,
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.260]   the active agent.
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.340]   Same idea in the psychological research.
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:53.200]   In this case, what we did was give people Kool-Aid to drink.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.480]   And for some people that Kool-Aid was sweetened with sugar,
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.680]   an actual caloric entity.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.760]   It could give them energy.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.120]   Other people drank Kool-Aid sweetened with Splenda.
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.280]   So yeah, it's sweet
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.940]   but it actually doesn't have any caloric value.
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:08.400]   You're not giving people energy.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:12.600]   You're just giving them that experience of sweetness.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.040]   Now, some people of course are really good
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.080]   at identifying what's real sugar and what's Splenda
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.560]   but when you put it in a Kool-Aid,
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.360]   a pretty noxious powder,
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.040]   it actually masked it for everybody
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.400]   and nobody had any idea.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.800]   - 'Cause it tastes like garbage to everybody.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.640]   - It tastes like garbage.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.760]   - Sorry, Kool-Aid.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.000]   I mean, I'm sure there are many people that love Kool-Aid.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.080]   I guess the sales of Kool-Aid will reveal the data.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.760]   - Yeah, I grew up in Nebraska actually
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.040]   where Kool-Aid is from.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.380]   It originated in Nebraska.
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:38.340]   So I do feel like I'm betraying my roots slightly
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:40.880]   by casting some shade on Kool-Aid
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.680]   but that's how it worked
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.800]   is that we asked them to guess what they got.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.860]   We tested them afterwards and they were wrong.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.960]   So nobody is able to guess with accuracy
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.720]   what was your drink sweetened with,
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.800]   which is important because they were blind.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.260]   The way that scientists use it,
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:00.060]   they didn't know what it was that they were drinking.
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:03.520]   We give them about 10 to 15 minutes
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.040]   for that sugar to metabolize
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.320]   and we measured their circulating blood glucose levels
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.220]   to make sure that we had, in fact,
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:14.700]   to give in their body circulating glucose energy
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:17.540]   that they might use in the next activity.
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:20.140]   And the researcher, again, didn't know
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:23.480]   whether they had just served sugar or Splenda.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:25.660]   Then we asked people to estimate distance.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.200]   So we gave some people more energy
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.900]   or we kept others at whatever their normal level was.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.160]   And what we found is that those people
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.840]   who didn't even know it but who had been given more energy
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.640]   by drinking Kool-Aid sweetened with sugar
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.800]   perceived their space as more constricted.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.360]   That visual illusion of proximity was induced.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.840]   They felt that their finish line,
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.320]   again, in the context of an exercise task,
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.980]   was closer to them.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:51.820]   So in just the same way that these other physiology labs,
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:53.360]   vision science physiology labs,
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.760]   found that people who are chronically tired,
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.440]   who don't feel like they have as much energy,
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.120]   or those that are physically weighted down
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:04.580]   and for whom moving within an environment is more costly,
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:06.460]   we could create that experience for people.
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:08.500]   We did an experimental version of that,
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:12.160]   that if you have more energy, the world looks easier.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:15.400]   The distances to a finish line don't look as far.
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:19.280]   So that was some of the experimental evidence that we had
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.720]   to show that people's states of their body
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.720]   do impact their visual experience.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.680]   Now, I'm a motivation researcher.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.080]   So for me, the big question is,
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.080]   well, what's the point of that study then,
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.640]   besides just showing this connection between the body
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.960]   and the eyes and the visual experience?
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:35.660]   We think that that's fundamental to one of the reasons
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:38.400]   that people experience difficulty when they're exercising.
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.560]   When it's really harder for your body
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:44.960]   because of its physical state to move within a space,
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.040]   why don't, you might say like,
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.460]   well, why don't they just go exercise?
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.660]   Because the world looks harder to them.
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.560]   Because that distance that they're supposed to walk
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.980]   because a doctor tells them to,
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:56.940]   or that a partner encourages them to,
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:58.940]   or a hill that they should hike up
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:03:59.780]   because someone told them
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.040]   that would be good for their health,
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.620]   it looks more challenging to them
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:08.620]   than it does to somebody who's in better physical health.
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:11.640]   Now, if it looks that way, if it looks harder,
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.340]   if it feels like it might be harder,
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.800]   then psychologically, we know that it is.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.640]   When you have set yourself up psychologically, mentally,
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.760]   for that kind of failure experience,
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.600]   like I don't know that I have the resources
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:26.720]   to get this job done, this looks really hard,
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.140]   you're already motivationally in a place
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:32.840]   for this task to be closer to impossible for you.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:33.960]   So to put it all together then,
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.800]   what we know is that people whose bodies
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.000]   might make it more challenging for them to exercise
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.340]   are seeing the world in a more challenging way,
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.360]   and that is having these downstream motivational
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.940]   and psychological effects that makes it less likely for them
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:48.920]   to try to take on the task in the first place
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:53.320]   or to experience it as harder than other people would or do.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:57.680]   - Is the solution the same, however?
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.800]   Meaning if these people are taught
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.400]   to adjust their visual goal line
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.600]   or to set a visual spotlight on an intermediate goal,
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:09.400]   can they overcome some of this challenge
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.640]   that they face simply by virtue of their skewed perception?
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:16.060]   - Yes, so in all of the studies that we have done,
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.120]   looking at that connection
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.960]   between this narrowed focus of attention
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.060]   and improvements in exercise,
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:23.160]   we do not find that it only works
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.320]   for the people who are in shape
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.640]   or that it backfires for people who are out of shape.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.360]   It works for everybody.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.360]   This is a strategy that everybody can adopt
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.000]   because it's just simply about like,
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.200]   what do you allocate attentional resources to?
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.240]   What do you sort of ignore and what do you focus on?
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.500]   And that visually induces the same kind of illusion
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.880]   for everybody, regardless of whether you're overweight
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.860]   or you're at your target weight,
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:47.000]   or if you're struggling to get there
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.320]   or you've already accomplished where you want to be,
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.700]   that visual illusion can be induced for everybody
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:54.340]   and it has the same kinds of consequences.
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:55.840]   - Terrific.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.920]   Earlier, I made a joke about double espresso,
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.420]   but now I'll make a serious statement about double espresso,
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.380]   which is that it contains caffeine
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:05.880]   and caffeine as a stimulant, like all other stimulants,
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:09.440]   cause a change in our visual world.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.960]   The most salient one is the one
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.380]   that police officers look for,
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:14.280]   parents suspecting that their kids
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.960]   have ingested substances of any kind look for,
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:20.740]   which is if somebody's pupils are unusually large
[01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:23.260]   for a given visual environment,
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:27.480]   that is an indication of high levels of autonomic arousal.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.320]   In the street drug translation of this,
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.340]   people who take amphetamine or cocaine
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:32.420]   will have very big pupils.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:33.920]   People are very relaxed, have small pupils.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.960]   However, everyone should know that pupil size
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.360]   also is dynamically regulated
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.820]   by how bright a visual environment.
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:41.160]   So there are multiple things controlling pupil size.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.260]   However, we know that when we are very stressed
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:47.400]   or very aroused in any way, positive or negative,
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.280]   the pupils get big, but within the visual system,
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:54.060]   what that equates to is a narrowing of the visual aperture.
[01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:57.140]   So rather than ingesting sugar,
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:59.160]   which I'm guessing most of the world,
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.920]   certainly the US needs to ingest less sugar,
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.020]   at least that's what we're hearing.
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:04.240]   I'm sure there are a few sugar, you know,
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.080]   sucronistas out there, sucrosanistas,
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.720]   who will also come after me with pitchforks,
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.560]   but let's face it,
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.100]   most people will probably be better off ingesting
[01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:15.200]   less simple sugar, but caffeine is a great motivator
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.040]   because of the internal sense of arousal,
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.920]   but it also narrows our visual window.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:22.320]   I could imagine using healthy amounts of caffeine
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:25.560]   combined with maybe even blinders of the sort
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:28.800]   that horses wear, maybe like a hoodie and a hat,
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:31.820]   maybe even blinders in order to get over
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.800]   some of those more challenging milestones.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:37.000]   Is there any evidence that people are doing this without,
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.240]   well, obviously people are doing it
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.520]   without knowledge of how it works,
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:43.200]   but are there any studies looking at how adrenaline
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.680]   or epinephrine or any other stimulants impact motivation?
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:50.240]   - I don't know, honestly, yeah.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.920]   - I mean, energy drinks are a big thing now.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.960]   - Yeah, yeah, for sure they are.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.760]   And you know, if you actually are more physiologically
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.040]   aroused or jazzed or whatever, you know, amped up,
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:05.080]   or you just think you are in our studies,
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.780]   we have found that they work in the same way,
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:09.040]   that it can produce the same kinds of consequences.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.160]   So, and I like that because it tells us
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:13.200]   like you can actually change the state of your body
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.860]   to induce these kinds of experiences,
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:18.680]   or you can try to, you can just think that,
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:21.920]   you can trick yourself, you can placebo effect yourself out
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.780]   and produce the same kinds of effects.
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:25.400]   I had to give up coffee like 12 years ago,
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:27.520]   not because, not for any- - I'm so sorry.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:31.040]   - I love the taste, and so decaf is my jam,
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.240]   but I can't drink the caffeine
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.000]   because it didn't actually do the thing
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.720]   that it does for so many other people,
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.400]   like make me feel more energized and more awake.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.960]   I just got sweaty and jittery and anxious
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.800]   and I couldn't focus.
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.920]   - Yeah, some people who already have
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:45.420]   a fairly high baseline level of attention and motivation,
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:47.940]   they find that it puts the autonomic seesaw too far
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:49.400]   in the sympathetic tone.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.240]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:51.680]   - And I happen to marry the same kind of person.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.880]   He also can't drink caffeine, but loves the taste of coffee.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.220]   The interesting thing is that we both have to have coffee
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:00.240]   in the morning to feel like we're ready to go for the day.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.760]   So it's just part of our routine or whatever
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.840]   to have that taste and have that sensation
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.340]   to feel like I'm ready to take on the day,
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:07.360]   even though, I mean, yeah,
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:09.960]   decaf still has some caffeine in it,
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.080]   but we're not drinking that much of it
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:14.620]   to probably actually create a caffeinated experience
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:17.700]   in our body, but we're tricking ourselves psychologically
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:20.200]   into doing that thing that in years past
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.240]   used to work for us both.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.840]   So I think that's something to keep in mind.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.260]   Like, you might have a hoodie that you can wear
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:28.520]   to induce that visual illusion,
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.380]   or you can take advantage of the power of your mind.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.960]   At the end of the day, I'm a psychologist
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:35.440]   and I believe that we have some non-zero power
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:36.760]   over what our mind is doing,
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:37.820]   what we're thinking about,
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:41.320]   what we allocate our attention to
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.760]   that can do the same kind of thing that a hoodie might do
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.120]   or that a cup of caffeine might do.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.320]   - I completely agree.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.800]   The visual aperture is under our conscious control.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.700]   That's an amazing feature of our visual system.
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.040]   We can narrow or expand it.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.360]   It takes a little bit of practice, I think,
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.780]   for people to learn how to do this
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:57.140]   without moving their head around
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:00.080]   to expand their visual aperture and how to narrow it.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.840]   But what I always tell people is
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.800]   just imagine a really troubling text message
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.540]   or a really exciting text message coming in.
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.600]   All of a sudden, you forget about the world around you.
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.280]   So it can be triggered by these outside events
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.440]   and we can learn how to anchor our visual attention.
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:16.900]   I'd love to ask about other kinds of goals,
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.380]   meaning non-physical goals,
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:23.380]   because many people are trying to read more, I would hope,
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:25.560]   or learn music or a language
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:28.940]   or things that really involve cognitive goal lines
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:32.040]   or internal goal lines.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.020]   You know, reading one chapter out of a book each night
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.060]   is a tangible goal.
[01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:39.220]   The other that I've often wondered about
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:42.000]   are these systems that allow you to highlight
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.660]   individual lines or even words on a page.
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.280]   That's very visual, obviously,
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.260]   and everything else is ruled out except that word.
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.660]   I've always wished for books
[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:51.700]   that would naturally highlight each page.
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.320]   And as I say this, someone will put in the comments,
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.740]   this has probably existed for 10 years
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:57.100]   and I'm just showing how what a luddite I am.
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:02.100]   But is there any example or tactic that people could use
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.880]   to better approach cognitive goals of school, work,
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:11.320]   recreational too, but that don't exist
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:14.200]   in the kind of fitness and sports domain?
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.040]   - Totally.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:17.120]   Yeah, so just to shout out to my brother-in-law
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.340]   who has done some of that research
[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:21.500]   where it does highlight different parts of words
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.600]   in paragraphs and he's found it to be an effective way
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.840]   for English as a second language learners to pick it up,
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.500]   that that is, that tying that vision
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.460]   to the process of learning language is effective.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:34.200]   And so there's a whole cool body of work
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.680]   and researchers looking at that.
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:36.960]   So you're right about that.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.060]   - If you want to mention what he does,
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:41.340]   is there a place that people can learn more about that?
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:43.000]   We can provide links.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:43.840]   - Yeah, let me.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:46.320]   - Okay, we will provide links to those resources
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.400]   'cause I want those resources.
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.140]   I've been trying to learn a second language for a long time.
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.800]   I speak Spanish pretty weekly,
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.480]   but I would love to get better at it.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.740]   Okay, I'll approach you later.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.180]   - My five-year-old son speaks Spanish
[01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:57.400]   better than I do at this point.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.800]   - And clearly better than I do too, thank you.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:01.660]   (laughing)
[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.100]   Yeah, so I was thinking that too.
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:06.340]   We started this work within the context of exercise,
[01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:08.060]   but of course that's not people's only goal
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.460]   that they have in life.
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:12.820]   And it isn't mine either.
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:16.560]   I have interests outside of improving my exercise game.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.460]   A couple years ago when I was writing the book,
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:22.420]   I also had a child.
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:24.700]   The same month that I had the opportunity
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.880]   to pull all this research together
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:30.340]   is the same month that my son came to be.
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:34.420]   And I started to realize I became a lot less interesting
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:35.860]   once he was around.
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:38.820]   He was fascinating, but I was changing diapers
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:40.240]   and feeding him and that was it.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.880]   People would come over, like, "What's up?
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:42.700]   "Where have you been?
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.220]   "Tell me something that's going on in your life."
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:47.220]   And all I had to talk about was this, what was boring.
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:48.860]   And I just felt like I've lost myself.
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:51.180]   I used to pride myself on the crazy adventures
[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:52.640]   and problems I would get myself in,
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.340]   and I was a great storyteller.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:55.760]   And that all of a sudden disappeared
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:56.980]   as soon as he came into the world
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:59.320]   because he became my world.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:00.160]   So then I started thinking,
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.560]   "I need to pull back some coolness
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:03.920]   "if I ever had it in the first place,
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.340]   "but I need to be a cooler person
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:07.180]   "than I'm coming across right now."
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.780]   So I decided I wanna learn to play drums.
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:14.580]   And I wanna be a one-hit wonder as a rockstar drummer.
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:15.520]   I only want one song
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.180]   'cause I know I'm not gonna be able to do more than that.
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:19.660]   I'm not coordinated at all.
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:22.740]   From the beginning of time, in fifth grade,
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:25.060]   I have this really vivid flashbulb memory
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:27.020]   of playing basketball for the very first time.
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:27.860]   I lost my footing.
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:29.220]   I knocked into my own teammate,
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:30.800]   pushed her out of bounds where she had the ball.
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:31.640]   We lost the game,
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.960]   and I was not invited back on the team for the next season.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.020]   And so that, you know,
[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:39.860]   fermented my self-definition of uncoordinated.
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:42.380]   I am a musician, but I am not a drummer.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:45.900]   And the idea of coordinating four limbs in real time
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:49.340]   was like, "If I could do that, I would be so proud."
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:51.140]   So that's a goal that I set for myself
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:53.640]   at the same time that my son came into this world
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:56.780]   when I was also trying to think about goal setting
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:14:00.020]   and how to improve my ability and all of our ability
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.900]   to get a job done when you're faced
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:04.540]   with some pretty big obstacles.
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.300]   So I got to practice all these techniques
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:08.740]   that we're talking about on myself and see for myself.
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.380]   When I tell people, "Hey, try this thing,"
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:11.420]   like narrow focus of attention,
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:15.260]   "Does it help with something like becoming a better drummer?"
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:16.340]   And the answer is, "Yeah."
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.580]   These tactics at least work for me sometimes
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:19.620]   under some circumstances,
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.520]   and they do for other people who try them for other goals
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.780]   that aren't necessarily about exercise.
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:28.020]   One that I found particularly helpful
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:31.420]   was overcoming my bad memory.
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:34.420]   That everybody's memories are faulty, right?
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:37.780]   Everybody has sort of a warped perception of the past.
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.440]   It might be skewed more positively than maybe we deserve,
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.300]   or it might be skewed more negatively
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:45.520]   if you feel that what looms large in your mind
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.500]   as you reflect on something from the past,
[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.020]   or the mistakes that you've made,
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:52.360]   or the things that the social faux pas that you had,
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.000]   or challenges that you faced at work
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.400]   when you got in trouble with a boss or with a colleague,
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.440]   if that's what really stands out in your mind,
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:03.000]   or the good side of all of those possibilities,
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   we probably aren't getting the world right.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.120]   And that is something that our brain has evolved,
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:11.400]   to give us a faulty memory, to level and sharpen,
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:13.640]   to not encode and remember and be able to recall
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.080]   everything that we've experienced
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:17.560]   with accuracy and precision.
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.580]   And that's a problem when it comes
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:22.160]   to assessing our own goal progress,
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.380]   when we wanna be our own accountant
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:26.780]   and try to determine how are we doing?
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:28.600]   If I wanna become a drummer,
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.980]   am I on track for getting there before X,
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:34.320]   before my time runs out?
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.060]   Am I gonna make it or not?
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:37.280]   And I think that's an experience,
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:38.320]   whether they wanna be a drummer or not,
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.780]   that a lot of people can resonate with,
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:42.680]   like trying to determine is this trajectory,
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:45.080]   is this rate of progress gonna get the job done
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.280]   by X amount of time?
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.240]   Will I have my swimsuit body by summer
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:52.780]   or will I save enough for retirement by the time I hit 65?
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:54.720]   For these goals where time is involved
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.400]   and there is a deadline,
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:01.120]   we do take moments to assess our trajectory.
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:03.500]   And if we just rely on our memory,
[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.520]   we're probably gonna do a bad job
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:08.780]   of assessing that trajectory,
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:12.440]   of knowing whether we're on pace to meeting our deadline.
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.360]   And I found that to be the case as I was thinking about,
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:16.360]   am I actually gonna be able to learn this song?
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.040]   I mean, I know that it's going a lot slower
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.200]   than it probably would for anybody else,
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.560]   but to give myself a deadline and a commitment,
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.040]   I decided I was gonna put on a show.
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.880]   I was gonna invite everybody I knew
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.440]   and also people I didn't know,
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.220]   and I was gonna play my one song for them.
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:32.360]   - This is while writing a book
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.680]   and having just had a child.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.340]   - Yeah, so when you read the book,
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:39.360]   you'll see my story and it's the real truth of it.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:43.960]   I mean, I did play that show and it was fine.
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:46.160]   And then I've, because I wrote about it in the book,
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:49.300]   then some other opportunities to play it publicly
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.300]   have come up and it's like, all right,
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.440]   I told people I can play drums.
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:56.260]   I better show them that I actually still can play this song.
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:57.800]   Yeah, so that's been fun.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.240]   I have become a one hit wonder
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.600]   if you ask me to play the song again.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.320]   Like Encore, it's just gonna get that same song
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:06.240]   a second time, so literally one hit wonder.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.080]   So in the process of figuring out,
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.600]   am I gonna be able to play this show,
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:10.840]   I sent out invitations.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.040]   The date is committed.
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.960]   People are coming to listen to my one song.
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.060]   God bless them.
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:18.760]   How's it gonna go?
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.360]   And it felt awful.
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.760]   It just felt like I am not making progress here
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.360]   because there's a lot more things
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:25.760]   that actually are pressing, right?
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:28.080]   Like the kid does need to get fed.
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.920]   I do have to go to my day job.
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.080]   The editor is asking for the next draft of this book
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.640]   and that is gonna take precedence
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.160]   like it does for so many people,
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.880]   that things command your bandwidth
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:41.000]   even when you have this goal that you've committed to
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.440]   and that you've got on the books.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.400]   And so I just felt this looming anxiety
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.360]   about this goal that would require,
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.640]   didn't have to be daily practice,
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:53.440]   but you can't cram that kind of a goal.
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.280]   It does take committed investment
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.840]   for a sustained period of time.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.280]   And so I had this looming anxiety
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.680]   that I'm not making good enough progress.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.440]   But that's because I was relying on my memory
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.320]   and my brain to recall like,
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.460]   how many times did you practice?
[01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:08.920]   What was it like the last time you practiced?
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:11.480]   What was it like when you tried to play this bit,
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.280]   or this riff like two weeks ago?
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.240]   Have you gotten any better since then?
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.080]   And it just felt like, no, I haven't practiced enough.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.680]   I don't remember when the last time I played was,
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.200]   but it definitely doesn't feel like I'm getting any better.
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.640]   Then I thought, you know what?
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.200]   I should stop relying on my brain
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:30.200]   to tell me where am I at and am I on an upward slope here?
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.440]   I need to look at the data.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.320]   I love data, scientists love data.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.680]   So I started to collect data on myself.
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:37.900]   What I did was download this app
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:40.400]   that a friend had told me about called the Reporter app.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.480]   There's lots of these kinds of things out there.
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.400]   Basically, it just like sets up your phone
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:46.900]   to randomly ping you with whatever questions
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:48.320]   you want your phone to ask.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.400]   It records your answers.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.380]   You can download the data.
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:54.560]   You can make pretty graphs to see what's my change
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.860]   and how I've answered these questions over time.
[01:18:57.860 --> 01:18:59.160]   So I did that for a month.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.480]   For a month, I had my phone ask me a couple times a day,
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:04.600]   oh, maybe twice a day, really.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.120]   Did you practice since last time I asked you?
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:09.180]   My phone says, did you practice?
[01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:10.760]   If mostly it was no.
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:13.600]   And if yes, then it would funnel a couple other questions.
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:14.660]   Like, how did you do?
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:15.880]   How do you feel?
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.800]   Check a couple of different emotion words now
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.700]   about your experience when you played.
[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:22.660]   So when I, and I did that for a month.
[01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:25.480]   After a month, went into my office, downloaded the data,
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:28.240]   and first took stock before I looked at the numbers.
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.820]   Like, how do I think I did over the last month?
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:33.320]   And I thought, same as every other month,
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.880]   I didn't really get anywhere.
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:37.300]   Yeah, I practiced, but I still feel awful.
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:38.240]   And I cried.
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.560]   I cried having to practice.
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:41.940]   I like was upset with myself for setting this goal
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:43.600]   and feeling like so anxious about it.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:44.960]   All I remember is that I cried.
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.780]   Cried too much about this personal conquest
[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:49.200]   that wouldn't matter to anybody else.
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.240]   Honestly, it really doesn't matter
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.580]   in the scope of things anyway.
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:54.140]   I'm not gonna become a drummer professionally.
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:57.720]   So who cares if I embarrass myself publicly?
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.480]   But what I found from the data
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.040]   was my memory was totally wrong.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:04.700]   I actually had practiced far more times than I remembered.
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:07.880]   And when I looked at like my emotion words that I used,
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.920]   it was a clear upward trajectory.
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.240]   Yeah, I did cry.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.840]   That part I hadn't misremembered or made up.
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:14.940]   But by the end of that month,
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:16.800]   like I had gotten a compliment from my husband
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.600]   who actually is a drummer and said like,
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.280]   "Hey, that wasn't that bad."
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.480]   And then there was like one expletive,
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.280]   "You were effing amazing
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.620]   at that one thing you've been practicing at."
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.520]   But like, okay, fine, he's my husband, right?
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.360]   Is he just, you know?
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:30.720]   So at the moment, it didn't really feel that great.
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:31.560]   And I downplayed it.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.820]   And as a result, it didn't stick in my brain, right?
[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:35.920]   I remember how stupid it felt that I cried
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:38.680]   because I can't do this, I can't make progress.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:40.040]   And I downplayed in my mind
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:41.060]   the thing that actually should have been
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:44.400]   a legitimate indicator that progress was being made.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.640]   So all of which is to say,
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:49.820]   I needed to see, to collect that data on myself
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:53.480]   and to look at it objectively, accurately, and completely
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.580]   because my brain wasn't doing that for me.
[01:20:56.580 --> 01:21:00.880]   That visual experience of downloading that data
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.620]   and looking at like, what was my actual experience,
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:06.780]   gave me a better insight.
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:10.620]   As I was trying to assess the trajectory of my progress,
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:14.320]   I became a more accurate accountant of my own progress,
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.040]   which is important for, you know,
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:17.620]   setting goals or resetting them
[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:20.500]   when you need to calibrate in light of what's left to do
[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.880]   and how much time do you have to do it in.
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:23.720]   - I love it.
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:26.260]   So basically, if I understand correctly,
[01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:30.560]   when the intermediate goals of say daily practice
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.180]   or twice a day practice, or reading, or math, et cetera,
[01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:36.680]   are not a visual goal line,
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:39.680]   it really does help to visualize some aspect
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.580]   related to that non-visual goal line.
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:44.600]   In this case, the reporter app was a useful tool.
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.680]   I've never heard of it, I plan to use it.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.440]   I'm sure a number of people will be interested in it.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.640]   It sounds like there are others out there,
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.520]   but that's the one that you found most useful.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:54.160]   - Yeah, yeah, there's another one too
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:57.280]   that is even more visual than that, than the reporter app,
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:58.580]   although that has visual components
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:00.440]   and is really effective if you like data
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:03.800]   and wanna collect numbers on yourself or your experience.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:06.780]   There's another one called the One Second Every Day app.
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:10.120]   This is really awesome because the app is a mechanism
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:14.560]   to record one second of your life.
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:17.160]   The goal, there's such an awesome community of people
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:20.460]   that just live by this and love having these experiences.
[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:25.040]   And the creator of it, I got a chance to talk with,
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.600]   and he has done this, he's taken a one second video
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:32.320]   of some aspect of his life every day for 12 years,
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:33.840]   13 years or something. - One second?
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.240]   - Yeah, one second.
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:38.720]   And then what the app does is like smash them together
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:41.600]   and give you like a chronology of what your year
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:45.060]   or your month or your last decade of life has been like
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:47.280]   and presents it as like a streamlined video for you.
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.000]   So you just see these flashes of your life
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.680]   over however long you tell the app
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.700]   to create a montage for you.
[01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:56.400]   And so when you see these videos that people have made,
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.380]   especially those that have been doing it
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:59.240]   for a really long time, it's fascinating.
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.600]   I did that for myself too.
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.520]   I tried it, one second of today's drumming performance,
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.840]   another second, it's not enough to capture it.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.360]   Am I actually doing a good job of drumming
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:09.300]   or what's my trajectory for drumming?
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:13.200]   But the guy who made it says one of the most like awesome
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:16.480]   one second videos that he ever made is of a brick wall.
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.120]   I was like, well, you don't need a video of that.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.080]   Like what's the wall doing?
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.200]   It's not crumbling.
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:22.280]   It's not like in earthquake land or something like that.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:26.380]   It's just like slightly jittery one second of a brick wall.
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:29.280]   And I was like, how is that motivating or exciting to you?
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:30.120]   Why is that?
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.760]   You've been doing this for 13 years every day, one second.
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:35.340]   Why is that the one second that matters to you most?
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:38.400]   And he says, because when it comes up in my montage,
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:42.000]   it reminds me of like a really horrific moment in my family.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.760]   That was the first wall that I saw
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:44.660]   when I walked out of the room,
[01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.560]   having heard that my sister-in-law
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:50.440]   had this awful, awful experience.
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.560]   Her intestines started to twist up on themselves
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:56.380]   and not up and she was on the brink of death.
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:57.900]   And we had just found this out.
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:59.220]   She had just gotten into the hospital.
[01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:01.620]   They diagnosed this issue that required like immediate
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:04.080]   surgery and our family was there to hear about this.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:07.140]   And we were all stunned that she might die.
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:09.060]   Like right now, she might die.
[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:10.320]   And that's the first thing that I saw.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:13.260]   And it reminds me of how precious life is,
[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:15.740]   how important family is and how the rest of whatever
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:17.580]   we were doing that day didn't matter
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:19.840]   because we all needed to be here together right now.
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:22.220]   And that is like all of this emotion
[01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:25.140]   and like purpose in life is conjured up
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:29.000]   or reminded when he looks at one second of a brick wall
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.740]   as it pops into his video feed.
[01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:33.360]   So if you're visually oriented and you do want ways
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.300]   to like remember what was life like,
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:38.500]   what has my year in review, what does it look like?
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:40.840]   That's an awesome app, One Second Every Day
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.940]   that can help you do that.
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:44.360]   - These are great recommendations
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:46.320]   and a couple of reflections.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:51.240]   First of all, the brick wall example is a beautiful way
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:53.920]   of highlighting this other feature of the visual system,
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:56.740]   which is that the brain largely thinks in symbols.
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:57.900]   It's very efficient.
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:00.880]   It batches entire experiences into symbols.
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.460]   In this case, the brick wall can be attached
[01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:04.900]   to a whole set of experiences that are very meaningful
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:08.000]   to this individual that brick walls don't mean that
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.420]   or didn't mean that to me until hearing this.
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:12.620]   So I think that it highlights the fact
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:15.060]   that the actual symbol is less relevant
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:17.060]   than what we attach to that symbol,
[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:19.320]   but that symbols are so efficient
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:21.580]   that even in a one-second view of something,
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:24.640]   we can attach to it for better or for worse.
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:29.100]   The other is that I'm an absolute almost rabid proponent
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:31.540]   of people getting morning sunlight in their eyes
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:34.500]   as the fundamental layer of setting their circadian rhythms
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.660]   and sleep and health as a zero-cost practice
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:37.500]   that believe it or not,
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:40.020]   can be done anytime of year or anywhere.
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:41.820]   But it does take a little bit of effort.
[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:42.780]   You know, you have to get outside.
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:44.620]   You can't do it through a window or windshield
[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:45.440]   for it to be efficient,
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.860]   but it has huge outsized effects on human health.
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:50.820]   This has now been demonstrated again and again and again.
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:54.180]   And so I'm going to just do a sort of call to action
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:55.220]   if people aren't already doing this.
[01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:57.060]   I'm going to start using the one-second app
[01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:59.580]   to record my morning sunlight viewing
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:01.240]   and prove that even through cloud cover,
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:03.860]   you're getting more photons than you are indoors
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:04.940]   and that it's worthwhile.
[01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:07.180]   I also would love to do this for my next dog
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:09.940]   to go from puppy to full-sized dog
[01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:12.020]   and maybe even to the end, who knows?
[01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:15.380]   Great, these are wonderful tools.
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:18.340]   You've given us a huge number of practical tools,
[01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:21.600]   which frankly isn't always the case on these podcasts.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.740]   We always strive to do science and science-based tools
[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:24.740]   is our kind of mantra,
[01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:27.960]   but you've given a rich set of tools here to apply.
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:31.460]   I just want to briefly backtrack to something
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.580]   and then a final question.
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:36.100]   Earlier, we were talking about how unfit people
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:37.480]   see the world as more challenging,
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:40.020]   maybe even hills as steeper, distances as further,
[01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:42.740]   and how shifting people into a state of energy
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:45.000]   either cognitively or through the ingestion
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.620]   of real glucose to get an energetic lift
[01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:49.820]   or maybe through caffeine, if that's within their practice
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:53.120]   and span of healthy behaviors, they could do that.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:57.960]   There are so many people who are suffering from depression,
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.540]   which one of the key features of depression
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:02.500]   is a lack of energy,
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:05.500]   even though there can be anxiety associated with depression.
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:09.640]   I have to wonder whether or not some of these tools
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:11.820]   are being deployed or will be deployed
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.280]   in the context of mental health,
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:16.260]   because depression is this vicious loop, right?
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:19.740]   People feel a lack of energy and hopelessness
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.460]   and then things just look harder.
[01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:24.700]   And so then it just verifies their negative worldview
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:26.140]   and it's a downward spiral.
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:28.540]   That's why medication in some cases
[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:30.220]   and social support, et cetera, can be helpful
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:31.860]   because they feel more energized.
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:34.740]   The side effects are a problem, however.
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:37.380]   Have there been any efforts to implement
[01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:39.620]   some of these visual tools
[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:42.700]   to create this increase in systolic blood pressure
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:44.140]   and a kind of readiness and willingness
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:46.920]   to lean into what people perceive as immense challenge?
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:48.580]   And if not, for anyone listening,
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:49.780]   I know we have a lot of listeners
[01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:50.860]   in the mental health space
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:53.760]   and in the helping space, so to speak.
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:57.140]   I can imagine these are zero cost, right?
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:00.100]   They, we all provide, people are cited,
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:02.880]   have the apparati to do it.
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:04.280]   Are you aware of any studies like this
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.060]   or is your laboratory involved in any studies?
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:08.360]   'Cause I just see an immense value
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:11.460]   of implementing the sorts of tools that you've developed.
[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:14.860]   - Yeah, we haven't explored that, those ideas directly.
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:16.780]   So call to all the scientists that are out there,
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:18.340]   this is, there's a great opportunity
[01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:20.020]   to start looking at these tools
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:22.340]   within the mental health space, you're right.
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:27.340]   Other researchers though have not this use of narrowed,
[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:29.560]   like inducing a narrow attentional focus
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:32.700]   and can they now feel more energized to go for a run?
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:34.180]   But they have looked at the relationship
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:37.400]   between anxiety, depression, and visual experience
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.780]   and found over decades evidence
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:42.940]   that people with depression or with anxiety,
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:45.480]   what their attention is captured by
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.260]   within the bigger global surrounding world
[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:49.780]   are those things that are negative
[01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:51.600]   or reinforcing of their worldview.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:52.660]   Now that happens for everybody,
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:55.660]   the things that are on our mind tend to like pop out
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:56.980]   that if whatever we're thinking about,
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:59.400]   we might start seeing some version of it
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.780]   showing up in the world around us
[01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:02.700]   that captures our attention.
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:04.440]   That's an idea called priming.
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.680]   What we're thinking about might then lead us
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:10.300]   to attend to the world, to see things in a way
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.180]   that aligns with what we're already thinking about.
[01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.780]   It's just that when what we're thinking about
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:18.780]   are those depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts.
[01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:20.740]   When that is what is cognitively accessible,
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:22.280]   when that's what's going through our mind,
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:24.920]   then that's also what captures our visual gaze.
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:27.180]   So when we think like the world is hard,
[01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:29.380]   the world is full of sadness,
[01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:30.720]   and that's the thought in our mind,
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:32.460]   and then we start seeing the people
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:35.100]   with frowns on their faces or who are experiencing anxiety
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:37.540]   and that's what captures our attention
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:39.140]   even when there's other people around
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:40.560]   that might not be seeing the world
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.140]   or experiencing the world that way, it becomes reinforcing.
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:46.140]   When I think that the world is threatening
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:48.340]   and then I notice the threats that are around me
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:49.420]   that confirms what I'm thinking,
[01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:52.020]   which heightens my anxiety or my fear,
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:54.920]   and then it further leads me to narrowly focus
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.340]   on those elements of the environment
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:58.300]   that are aligned with that worldview,
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:29:59.940]   it's really hard to get out of that.
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:02.660]   Like that's where the vicious cycle can come from.
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:05.340]   So that has been really well established
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:09.360]   within the medical community, this selective attention
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:14.260]   relating to states of mental unwellness,
[01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:16.140]   that's been pretty well established.
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:19.740]   And so there's been some interventions done
[01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:22.340]   with people that have depression or anxiety trying,
[01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:24.580]   saying like, here's an array,
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:26.500]   a photograph of a bunch of different faces.
[01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:27.340]   Yes, it's artificial.
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:28.940]   It kind of looks like a page from a yearbook,
[01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:30.420]   a high school yearbook,
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:32.300]   but look for the faces that are smiling.
[01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:34.260]   Look at the faces that are smiling.
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:38.200]   Try right now, spend 10 minutes having your eyes
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:41.040]   focus on those and look at those people,
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:44.380]   that it is an effective intervention
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:47.500]   at improving people's sense of self-efficacy
[01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:48.820]   of what can I accomplish next?
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:50.140]   They feel a little bit more energized.
[01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:51.300]   It doesn't cure depression.
[01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:52.820]   It doesn't cure anxiety.
[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:57.420]   And these are literal, physical afflictions that we have.
[01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:59.320]   So that's not a quick fix,
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.460]   but it can produce a temporary change
[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:05.580]   that might be a way to start getting out of that rut.
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:08.520]   - Yeah, and I think nowadays there's an increasing attention
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:11.200]   on tools that will help people orient
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:14.400]   as they start to veer towards suicidal depression
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:17.440]   or veer back into a depressive episode or anxiety episode.
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:21.040]   I mean, trying to reverse an entire syndrome
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.220]   or set of syndromes is far more complicated.
[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:24.380]   Likewise in the health space,
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:26.560]   just trying to get people to deploy real-time tools
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:30.860]   to adjust their anxiety or to exercise more often and so on.
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:34.940]   As a kind of a final, but also kind of high-level question,
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:36.900]   I'm imagining that,
[01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:40.780]   and I plan to use this visual goal setting of spotlighting.
[01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:42.840]   I've been using it actually for some time on runs.
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:43.680]   It works really well.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:45.540]   Yesterday I took a run near the waterfront here
[01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:48.720]   and the entire, I think I did it somewhat incorrectly,
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:50.180]   the entire run I was thinking about getting back
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:52.580]   to the statue, which I started,
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:56.100]   but I did find that I ran fastest in the final 20 meters,
[01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:58.500]   which admittedly wasn't fast at all,
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.740]   but it was faster than what preceded it.
[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:05.300]   So it works and it makes perfect sense as to how it works.
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:08.440]   You've done other studies exploring
[01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.220]   some of the other features of vision,
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:12.540]   like the luminosity, how bright something is
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:13.500]   and how people perceive it.
[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:15.520]   That was in a completely different context,
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.340]   but is there a kind of a higher level,
[01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:19.660]   a kind of a black belt version
[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:20.840]   of what we're talking about here,
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:24.020]   where not only am I focusing on a specific visual location
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:27.140]   as an intermediate or a long-term goal,
[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:29.740]   or I'm using an app to ask me a question
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:30.980]   and tap into how I'm feeling,
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:33.640]   create a visual representation of my motivational state,
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:37.220]   but then I'm also making my phone as bright as possible.
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:39.320]   I'm also trying to take that visual window
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:42.140]   and actually pay attention to more of the details
[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:43.540]   at that location.
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:47.460]   Or is it simply a matter of kind of in geek speak,
[01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:49.180]   visual neuroscience, we would just call this
[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:50.420]   like low spatial frequency,
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:52.300]   just sort of grabbing a black and white snapshot
[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.860]   of something here or there in my mind.
[01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:57.340]   If I attach more detail and effort
[01:32:57.340 --> 01:32:59.580]   to the specific thing that I'm focused on,
[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:02.380]   is there any evidence that that's more effective?
[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:05.820]   - It certainly changes what our brains are doing.
[01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:07.680]   So how do we define effectiveness?
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:09.340]   That's a question for philosophers
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:10.180]   and that scientists will always-
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:11.100]   - Will it keep me running?
[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:12.620]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.520]   It will when you use it towards the end of your run,
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.020]   just like you've picked up on.
[01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:21.220]   Yeah, so there's cool studies that neuroscientists,
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:23.160]   not I, not coming from my lab,
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:24.620]   that neuroscientists have done looking at
[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:26.180]   what is it doing to your brain
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:28.880]   when you've decided that you're gonna focus your attention
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:31.540]   on this element of the world
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:34.180]   and not pay attention to something else?
[01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:36.420]   Is that just sort of like tricking your thoughts
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:37.740]   or is it doing something different
[01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:39.660]   to something more basic, more low level?
[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:41.460]   And the answer is yes.
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:44.940]   So there's an area of the brain, the fusiform face area,
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:46.900]   it's part of our brain that's really specialized
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:49.180]   for making sense of faces.
[01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:50.700]   It's important as a social species
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:52.980]   to pay attention to other people,
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:53.980]   pay attention to their faces
[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:55.580]   while they're trying to communicate through their face.
[01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:57.140]   And so our brain has developed
[01:33:57.140 --> 01:34:01.060]   a really specialized central area for doing that.
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:06.860]   So these neuroscientists will present a face to somebody,
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:11.720]   but superimposed over that is a house or something else
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:16.600]   that is less special to us as a social human species.
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:18.620]   And so both of those things,
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:20.180]   because it's sort of like both images
[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:23.660]   are sort of transparent, overlaid over one another,
[01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:28.660]   our eyes are getting both of those images in
[01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:31.500]   and our brain is getting both of those images in,
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:35.940]   but we can will ourselves to focus on the house.
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:37.820]   Just really pay attention to the features of the house,
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:40.220]   even though everything about that face is still there too.
[01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:42.940]   Or pay attention to the face and just tell me like,
[01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:46.180]   what is it that you are deciding that you wanna hold on to,
[01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.820]   that you wanna look at right now?
[01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:49.820]   And you can see that the brain is responding to that.
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:51.100]   So when people are saying like,
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:52.700]   I'm really seeing that face,
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:55.380]   the details of the face, I'm paying attention to the face,
[01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:58.180]   even though we know their eyes are also looking at
[01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:00.620]   and engaged with the contents of the house,
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:03.000]   that's right there, smacked on top,
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.340]   the fusiform face area lights up.
[01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:06.460]   And when they're saying like,
[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:07.900]   no, I'm really focused on the house now,
[01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:10.780]   we see activation in the fusiform face area decline
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:15.740]   and other areas of the brain's neurological real estate
[01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:17.160]   start to engage.
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:20.980]   So yeah, I think there's something to it
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:23.460]   that we can, at a high level,
[01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:28.060]   our brains are responding to our psychology as well.
[01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:30.260]   And we have that great power to really,
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:34.040]   with intention, with practice,
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.620]   decide how do I wanna engage with the world?
[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:40.440]   And can it produce real change in our bodies
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:42.220]   and in the way that we experience the world?
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:44.020]   The answer is yes.
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:45.220]   - Fantastic.
[01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:49.160]   Well, you've given us a ton of mechanistic
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:53.020]   and conceptual and practical information.
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:56.020]   So I'm speaking for a lot of people when I say,
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:58.220]   thank you for taking the time out of your schedule
[01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:00.000]   amidst kids and running a lab
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.300]   and teaching at the university and your book,
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:05.820]   which we will point people to and provide a link to,
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:08.180]   is a wonderful resource.

[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:32.220]   There I cover science and science-related tools,
[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:33.820]   some of which overlap with the contents
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:34.980]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:37.100]   but much of which is distinct from the information
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:38.360]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:40.220]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on Instagram
[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:42.060]   and Huberman Lab on Twitter.
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:44.220]   And as mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,
[01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:46.560]   we are now partnered with Momentus Supplements
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:48.540]   because they make single ingredient formulations
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:50.140]   that are of the absolute highest quality
[01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:52.180]   and they ship international.
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:54.820]   If you go to livemomentus.com/huberman,
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:56.180]   you will find many of the supplements
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:57.760]   that have been discussed on various episodes
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:59.340]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:01.020]   and you will find various protocols
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:02.380]   related to those supplements.
[01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:04.180]   So thank you once again for joining us today
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:06.020]   for our discussion about the science
[01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:07.860]   and science-related tools of motivation,
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:09.140]   goal-seeking, and pursuit.
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:11.500]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.280]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.860]   [upbeat music]
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:18.440]   (upbeat music)
