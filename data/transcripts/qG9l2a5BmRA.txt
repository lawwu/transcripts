[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.120]   - We're back with guest Francis Chan
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.480]   who joins us from San Francisco.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.560]   Francis and his wife Lisa wrote a new book,
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.940]   You and Me Forever, Marriage in Light of Eternity.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.840]   And Francis, you have five daughters,
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.840]   so one day you'll be dealing with suitors at the door,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.260]   if not already.
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.620]   And there seems to be a shortage of godly young men
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.640]   for a variety of reasons that is probably connected
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.840]   to porn use and video game addictions, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.760]   And on the Ask Pastor John podcast,
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.060]   we get a steady stream of emails from young women
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.280]   who want to know, what should I expect to see
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.000]   in a young Christian man to signal
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.440]   that he's ready for marriage?
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.680]   How would you answer them?
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.280]   What are you looking for?
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.120]   - Well, you know, it's interesting.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.800]   My daughter did bring home a guy
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.140]   a few months ago from college.
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.920]   And some of my friends asked her,
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.060]   they say, "Hey, how serious are you with him?"
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.340]   And they told me her answer was so weird.
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.420]   They said, her answer was,
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.260]   "I just want to hang out with him long enough
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.180]   "to see if God answers his prayers."
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.940]   I mean, that's a weird answer,
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.900]   but in her mind, that was her gauge.
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.840]   Okay, she lives with a dad,
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.640]   or she spent these 18 years with a dad
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.060]   who prays to God, and she would see how,
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.260]   man, my dad knows God.
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.560]   God answers him when he prays.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.520]   And so now that she's with these guys,
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.980]   she wants to know, okay, do you really know God?
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.500]   I mean, do you really know him?
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.920]   Is it a true relationship with him?
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.800]   Because growing up, she would see,
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.840]   like sometimes God would answer her prayer,
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.260]   and I'd point it out to her.
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.740]   And I remember times I would sit her and her,
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.900]   my second oldest down.
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.140]   I'd go, look, you guys, you see the way God answers
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.700]   mom and dad's prayers.
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.840]   And when it comes time for you to get married,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.580]   that's why I want you so badly to just be with a guy
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.020]   who knows and loves Jesus.
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.540]   Because if you don't, you're forfeiting all of this.
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.740]   And so in their mind, it's really about this relationship.
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.540]   And I guess her answer tells me that she feels
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.060]   you can tell a lot about a person by how he prays
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.580]   and whether or not God listens.
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.100]   Because prayer is conditional.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.020]   We see in scripture, God often hates our prayers.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.820]   And says, I'm not listening to that.
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.380]   It's a bunch of noise to me.
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.340]   You know, if there's doubting or selfishness
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.340]   or unrepentance, insincerity, it's a lack of reverence.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.540]   God wants to hear the prayers of those who love him
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.060]   and know him and are walking with him.
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.700]   And so for them, I think that's the picture.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.700]   I don't wanna get too much into specific actions
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.060]   because that can be almost religious.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.020]   It's more, gosh, does God, does he really know him?
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.300]   Does he really love Jesus?
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.900]   And is he truly known by him to where that prayer life
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.480]   is so deep and rich?
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.100]   - Thank you, Francis.
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.180]   And on a related note, Pastor John has addressed dating
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.380]   in a couple of episodes.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.300]   Episode number 122, titled,
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.820]   Is My Boyfriend's Porn a Marriage Deal Breaker?
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.900]   And episode number 486,
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.260]   Is My Boyfriend's Video Game Addiction
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.980]   a Marriage Deal Breaker?
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.260]   Those are critical questions we receive often from listeners.
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.220]   And it's always great to hear from you out there.
