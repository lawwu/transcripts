[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.620]   Praise and possessions.
[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.960]   Those are two dominant idols of our age.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.000]   The desire for self-glory and the desire for material wealth.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.080]   So what is the Christian's relationship to the praise of the world and to the possessions
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.080]   of the world?
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.320]   Pastor John explained in a really helpful sermon at the 2019 Gospel Coalition National
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.720]   Conference in Indianapolis.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.520]   The sermon on Jesus' words in Mark 8 verses 31 to 38.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.760]   I'll begin by reading the text.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.480]   Mark 8 31 to 38.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.680]   And he, Jesus, began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.800]   rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.600]   days rise again.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.320]   And he said this plainly.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.420]   And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.040]   But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, "Get behind me, Satan, for
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.320]   you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.520]   And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, "If anyone would come after
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.040]   me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.240]   For whoever would save his life will lose it.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.940]   But whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospels will save it.
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.560]   For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and to forfeit his soul?
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.440]   For what can a man give in return for his soul?
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.160]   For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation,
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.720]   of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.440]   the holy angels."
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.240]   Here now is Pastor John.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:53.840]   Verse 36, "What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.300]   For what can a man give in return for his soul?"
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.300]   This is about possessions.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:12.160]   This is about stuff, money, houses, books, computers, land, businesses.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.720]   Suppose your heart considers the worth of Jesus and considers the worth of possessions,
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.760]   the gladness you could have in Jesus, the gladness you could have in possessions.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.560]   And suppose your heart is drawn to prefer possessions, which is what is happening to
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.600]   billions of people.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.800]   Suppose your heart is drawn to prefer the worth of possessions and you turn away from
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:51.080]   Jesus and you embrace as superior to Jesus all that earthly possessions can give you.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.960]   And suppose you succeed all your life, you succeed, nothing but success.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:08.640]   And by the end of your life, suppose you own everything, the world, everything, not just
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.400]   Apple and Google, mobile oil, all of it.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   It's yours.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.960]   You call all the shots.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.920]   You own them all.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.040]   That's what he envisages, right?
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:31.080]   Verse 36, "Gain the whole world and then you die."
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.800]   And instantly you realize it was suicide.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.680]   It was eternal suicide.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.680]   And suppose facing Jesus, you say, "I'll give you everything.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.080]   I'll give you everything I have.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.080]   I own it all.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.960]   I'll give you everything, the whole world in return for my soul."
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.720]   What do you think he will say?
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:15.640]   I think he will say this, "You would try to buy your soul with the very possessions
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.240]   that destroyed your soul?
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:25.400]   The very possessions that you preferred over me?
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:38.600]   Christ-replacing, Christ-belittling idols have no currency in heaven."
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.880]   And he will turn his face away and you will perish forever.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:53.440]   What you just tried to do with your money, that ransom, pay.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:03.280]   For the many, for the elect of God, the ransom is paid and you preferred not to be a part
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.720]   of it.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.280]   You preferred not to be with Jesus.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.160]   You preferred to make crystal clear you were not elect.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.920]   That's what you meant to do.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.480]   You're going to go with the alternative treasure.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.120]   "Oh, my, don't do that."
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:31.200]   That's verses 36 and 37, and the intention is to clarify how the me and my gospel of
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.280]   verse 35 is more precious than things.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.000]   Do you feel freedom welling up in your heart right now?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   I do.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.360]   I mean, there are temptations.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.120]   73, with stuff.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.120]   I need all the help I can get to be free.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.120]   Right?
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.800]   You do too.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:59.640]   Free, free, free from the main idols in the world, possessions and praise.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.480]   Let's look at praise.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.720]   Verse 38, "For whoever is ashamed of me and my words."
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.800]   And notice again, me, me, my words.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.120]   Verse 35 said, "Me and the gospel."
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.120]   Here it's me and my words.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:24.280]   "Whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.440]   him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father and with
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.040]   the holy angels."
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.200]   So Jesus is making clear there are two audiences for our lives.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.520]   Number one, this adulterous and sinful generation.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.800]   Adulterous, not mainly because they sleep around, but because they find more pleasure
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:57.000]   in God's creation than in God, and thus they commit adultery against God, which is
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.600]   the essence of sin.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.880]   Adulterous and sinful generation.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:11.720]   The other audience is three, the coming of the Son of Man or the Son of Man at his coming,
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:19.240]   his glorious Father, and millions, I'm going to say millions from Daniel 7, millions of
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.560]   holy angels.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.240]   That's a lot of glorious beings to smile at you or turn away.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.840]   And the question for us is, whose approval do we crave most?
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:39.160]   Whose praise are you most desperate not to lose?
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.240]   In whose presence do you fear most being shamed?
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.600]   Which relationship is most precious to you?
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:55.080]   Which brings us back now to verse 35, "Whoever would save his life will lose it."
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:03.960]   That is, whoever lives to save his reputation, to avoid shame, to save his acceptance with
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:12.760]   the people that matter to him, namely an adulterous and sinful generation, which points out the
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:19.160]   inanity of it all, will lose his respectable and popular life.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:26.320]   The Son of Man, the Son of Man, the all-glorious Father, the millions of holy angels will,
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.480]   in one terrifying moment, turn their face away in eternal shame.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.120]   If you have tried to save, "I've got to save my reputation.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.520]   I've got to save my acceptance.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:44.720]   I've got to save how cool I am in the lives of everybody," you're going to die.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:50.720]   And millions of angels, the noblest creatures in the universe under God, will turn their
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.120]   face away.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:59.080]   But the second half of verse 35, "Whoever loses his life on account of me and the gospels
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.080]   will save it."
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:08.280]   In other words, whoever experiences me and my suffering and my rejection, my death, my
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:15.160]   shameful crucifixion, my resurrection, whoever experiences all that is more precious than
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:26.480]   the respectability of popularity, more precious than being accepted, being admired by an adulterous
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.840]   and sinful generation, you're going to live forever under the smile of the Son of Man
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.260]   and his Father and millions of angels.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.640]   So here's the sum of the matter.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:45.880]   Mark 8, 31 to 38 is first news, the greatest news in the world.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:52.160]   Verse 31, "The Son of Man must suffer many things.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.080]   He must be rejected.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.600]   He must be killed.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   And he must rise again.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:09.080]   The merciful, sovereign, all-controlling God planned it, prophesied it, performed it, suffering,
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:14.500]   rejection, death, resurrection of the Son of Man.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:20.600]   And therefore, it's not random, it's gospel.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.040]   It's ransom.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.800]   It's grace.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:30.200]   The way in to the gospel so that you not only experience the suffering, the rejection, the
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:38.040]   death, but the resurrection unto eternal joy with Jesus, the way into that is to experience
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:45.580]   the birth of a new self, a self that looks at the suffering, the rejection, the killing,
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:55.920]   the rising of Jesus, and then looks at possessions and looks at praise and says, "Possession-loving
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:02.840]   self, praise-loving self, I deny you.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.000]   I kill you.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.320]   I reckon you dead.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.760]   You have no dominion in my life."
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.040]   That's a new man.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.040]   That's a miracle.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.480]   That's salvation.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:21.360]   And if it costs me my life to deny you, you possession-loving self, you praise-loving
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:29.640]   self, if it costs me my life to deny you, I'll die gladly to be with Jesus forever.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.120]   That's the point of this text.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.120]   Amen.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.080]   Dying to self-praise and dying to a love of possessions.

[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.240]   Is God humble?
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.200]   It seems like such a simple question, doesn't it?
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   It's not.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.360]   It's actually a really great question, exactly the kind of question we have come to expect
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.920]   from our perceptive listeners out there.
