[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   What the ffff... What are you wearing, Jason?
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.800]   What? Oh, Uber had a big week, so this is the Uber-Montclair crossover hat.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.600]   Oh, look at that.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.360]   And I also bought a Montclair shirt.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.120]   You bought that or I sent it to you? Oh, what? You got the watch and the mug?
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.480]   Oh, you don't know about the Apple-Montclair watch?
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.840]   Or the commemorative mug?
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.640]   Or the new tack?
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.080]   You don't know about the new neck tats that are coming from Montclair?
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.200]   Is that the new neck tack?
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.040]   Oh my god.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.200]   Oh, so good.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.960]   Let's just say somebody got their beak wet.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.720]   I'm not saying that I got a $100,000 sponsorship,
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.280]   but we don't have a rule in the agreement about logo placement, do we?
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.920]   Listen, J. Cal, if anyone was willing to sponsor you,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.840]   every square inch of your clothing would be covered in ads like a race car driver.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.360]   It is. Look.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.280]   You'd be like wearing a jumpsuit every day.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.960]   You know, Montclair sponsorships are great.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.160]   This is $5 plus $17 of shipping from France on Etsy.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.000]   I'm ready to go.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:18.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.200]   How was everyone's week? What did you guys do this week?
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.880]   Just busy, working, trying to be helpful where I can.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.760]   And that'll be the extent of my comments today.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.520]   How is Market Street this time of year?
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.960]   Look, there's all sorts of wild report.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.320]   I've gotten all sorts of inbound from people asking me if I'm like leaving
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.400]   Kraft Ventures to do something at Twitter.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.200]   No, it's not true.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.200]   We're just, Jason and I are just pitching in and helping out while Elon establishes
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.680]   his permanent team at that company.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.880]   Elon's the CEO.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.680]   He's running it.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.480]   He's the decider.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.440]   He's making the decisions.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.800]   And some of us are just kind of helping out in any way we can.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.000]   And that's really the extent of it.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.360]   It's a very much part-time thing.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.400]   We're just helping a friend.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.360]   But it's been blown up by the media into something much more than it actually is.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.800]   It is 100% accurate.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.120]   I am still doing my day job, podcasting, investing in 100 companies a year,
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.720]   just helping out on the margins.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.220]   That's it.
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.160]   The end.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.240]   I do want to try talking about one issue that's already public, because it's already been
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.800]   tweeted.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.840]   So Elon had a tweet this morning about how there's now an advertiser boycott going on.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.720]   And this falls on the heels of a bunch of reports that came out over the last couple
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.640]   of days that supposedly there's been a big influx of racist tweets.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.120]   And Jason and I actually saw what was really going on, which was it's all not true.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.200]   I mean, what happened is that within hours of Elon taking over the company on Friday,
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.160]   there was a 4chan attack, where basically people from this message board created bots
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.840]   to post hundreds of thousands of spam messages that contained racist words and epithets.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.720]   And within hours, this has been detected.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.760]   And Yoel, who runs the trust and safety implementation, he met with me and Jason, and Elon directed
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.560]   him to shut it down.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.760]   And Yoel actually posted a tweet somewhere about it.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.480]   That's the only reason I feel comfortable talking about it, is because you already posted
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.160]   the tweet somewhere, but maybe people haven't seen it, or they haven't connected all the
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.720]   dots here.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.280]   But what's really, I think, unfair about this is that, as you've seen, it's not like your
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.120]   feed was all of a sudden filled with racist things.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.920]   These were spam accounts or bot accounts that were posting to zero followers.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.600]   They generally have zero followers, or if they do have followers, it's other bot accounts,
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.920]   right?
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.600]   So they're posting racist tweets into the ether, so to speak.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.840]   It's not degrading anyone's experience.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.960]   It was shut down promptly.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.400]   But then what happens is these activist groups, they're monitoring the fire hose, right?
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.480]   And so they publish a report saying that racist tweets have gone up 500% since Elon took over
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.800]   Twitter.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.840]   The truth is, Elon hasn't even had a chance to change anything about the content moderation
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.320]   policies.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.360]   He's posted that.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.040]   Like, guys, I haven't changed anything about content moderation.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.320]   Whatever the rules are, they're the same rules that existed prior to him taking over.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.320]   And this is just an organized operation by people who want to create that report.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.720]   So then these activist groups basically publish this report, they feed it to news outlets,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.200]   and then somebody then takes those reports and then feeds them to advertisers, and you
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.240]   get a boycott.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.920]   But I think the point here is that Elon didn't do this.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.680]   This is being manufactured by people who are not operating in good faith.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.080]   They're trying to manufacture an incident that they can then use to hurt the company.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.720]   Yeah, and it was thwarted immediately and fixed.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.480]   Have you guys seen episode 333 of the Lex Friedman podcast?
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.600]   He interviews Andrej Karpathy, who is really, I mean, one of the great minds of our time,
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   particularly around AI and ML.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.160]   And the question that Lex asked, which Andrej expounded on, which I think is really interesting,
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.160]   is, what does the next generation of bots look like?
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:05.360]   And I think where the problem gets very hard for all platforms, so this is not a Twitter-specific
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.000]   discussion, is that you can now generate such real, lifelike human images that are unique,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.720]   and you can also generate high-quality text to things like GPT-3 that can essentially
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.880]   push the boundaries of a low-level Turing test.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:33.760]   I think the real problem over time for bots, for spam, for coordinated attacks on any platform,
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.200]   is that when you use these tools, you're going to have to become very sophisticated in how you try
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.000]   to detect them and then to block them.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.360]   It's a really interesting discussion between two pretty meaningfully smart people.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.440]   Karpathy was the head of autopilot at Tesla, right?
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.400]   Autopilot Vision, yeah.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.760]   So he's really smart, yeah.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.760]   I have no doubt that Elon is going to do a much better job stopping bots on Twitter once
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.720]   he has a chance to do it, because he's got this amazing team of AI engineers, and he's
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.920]   just going to be more focused on it.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.800]   You know what I like the most about what I heard this week is the idea that you can do
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.840]   either micropayments or subscription to third-party content providers, because I think so much of my
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:23.600]   news feed is delivered to me through the Twitter app, and then I click on an article, and then
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.240]   it's like a paywall, or it's some sort of difficulty in accessing the content.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.640]   Having some integration there or some ability to kind of make a micro-purchase to read an
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.360]   article is going to be, I think, a super feature.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.440]   The other thing that I would love Twitter to experiment with is if you have a micropayments
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.240]   model to publishers, it would be great if you could publish content without a byline,
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.400]   a la The Economist, and see what that does to information quality.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.640]   Right.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:55.360]   If you do not get any credit to your individual name for writing stuff, but instead it goes
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.480]   to the Mass Ted publication, whatever it is, the Times, the Post, I think you could have
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.120]   a really important behavior change in how journalists cover the news.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.720]   It's worth experimenting with, at least.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.160]   And if you're paying them enough money, I think that you could probably demand that.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.760]   Facebook could probably demand that today.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.360]   You know, strip the byline away and just it just says New York Times.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.200]   Just like today, it just says The Economist.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.760]   Yeah, it is a The Economist is a very polarizing gig in journalism for that reason.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.360]   There are going to be actually a lot of journalists who would prefer to have their byline taken off.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.920]   One of the problems with journalism today is even if you're doing reporting in good faith,
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:39.280]   Chamath, and you put your byline on there, harassment, you know, threats, etc, can become
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.840]   very acute if you're just covering certain topics.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.160]   And so I actually think a lot of, you know, writers and journalists would opt into this,
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.360]   they might prefer it.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.280]   I think they should, because I think the two ends of the spectrum are better than this,
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.760]   you know, gross middle that we have the end of this one end of the spectrum is you have
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.920]   the New York Times, the Washington Post and The Economist with no byline and no attribution to
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.720]   reporters.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.880]   The other end is if you want to build a brand that's based on your name, go start a sub stack.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.000]   And I think that there's a very good balance there.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.480]   And the New York Times could syndicate that as well.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.400]   But if you separate the two, all of a sudden, the news becomes more likely to be truthful news
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.120]   versus, you know, well disguised opinion.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.400]   The other issue is, you know, for readers, if you do choose to do a no byline publication,
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.080]   you're really going to need time to build trust and for people to understand what you're doing,
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.880]   because they will think you're taking the byline off in order to pursue a certain agenda, right?
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.600]   So that is the the that is the suspicion that can build up.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.600]   The Economist has been able to do this over decades with trusted reporting.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.120]   And sub stack proves that you can have no reputation whatsoever.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.080]   And if you're publishing great content, you can build a great business from scratch.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.760]   So, you know, you don't need to you don't need to pay your dues,
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.280]   quote unquote, by getting a byline at the New York Times to be a clever writer.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.240]   You can start that business today and get paid.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.120]   So I think the New York Times should just focus on being the New York Times.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.480]   And sub stack should focus on individual people.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.000]   And I think if you could clean up the middle, that would be much better for all of us.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.800]   Anyways, I'm excited for you guys to help out and pitch in.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.160]   I hope you guys do some good with it.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.240]   I'd love to come back and use Twitter more often.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:18.800]   Can we talk about the reporting that happened with the two guys that trolled the journalists
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.560]   and pretended to be fired employees?
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.880]   Because I actually thought that was such an interesting moment this week that all the
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.480]   journalists immediately parroted it because it fed their narrative.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.240]   But there was no fact checking done.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.840]   There was no reporting done.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.960]   And then several of them, including, I think, Deirdre Bosa from CNBC,
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.080]   came out and publicly apologized for that report.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.200]   And if folks listening aren't familiar with what happened, these two guys came out,
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.280]   they pretended to be fired Twitter employees on Monday, walked out with a box.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.240]   Oh, what's funnier, I woke up and they were like, Hey, we just got fired.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:50.720]   It's terrible.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.520]   Life is awful.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.320]   No, it's even worse.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.360]   Husband and wife.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.200]   You know, the guy's name was one guy's name is Rahul Ligma.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.600]   And the other guy's name was like Mike Johnson.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.600]   So the whole thing was Ligma Johnson.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.200]   So I now here's what's so funny about due diligence.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.000]   Hold on.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.480]   I read this story without giving away that punchline to my kids.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.520]   All my kids immediately started howling.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:17.520]   They're like, Dad, if you say these two names are Ligma Johnson.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.960]   And I was like, Oh my God.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.200]   And so, you know, when, when, like, you know, preteens can figure this out,
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.760]   but the journalism industry could not.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.440]   It's kind of a very telling side.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.160]   Freeberg made the key observation, which is they didn't figure it out because they
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.760]   didn't want to because it fit their narrative.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.040]   So they don't fact check things that fit their narrative.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.720]   This was my point about journalism.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.520]   I just, it was so poignant to me this week when this happened,
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:46.160]   particularly as it relates to Twitter and the importance of call it open journalism
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.040]   or citizen journalism and the integrity of kind of, you know, of the voices that we all
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.200]   kind of trust as our kind of journalistic authorities that these guys came out and
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.440]   they were conned right outside Twitter's offices into telling a story that fit their
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.480]   sensational narrative.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.400]   And it was really a kind of poignant moment for me.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.160]   Well, do you remember that story?
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.680]   I think it was originally in Rolling Stone and then Rachel Maddow amplified it where
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.920]   it was in Oklahoma city where supposedly all these MAGA Republicans were eating horse
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.760]   paste because Trump told them to.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.720]   And they were in, this is basically, I thought it was like a COVID therapy.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.760]   And then they were going to the emergency rooms of all the hospitals and then they were
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.440]   turning away heart attack victims because there were so many of these people going to
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.160]   the emergency room.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.360]   Anyway, it all turned out to be like a made up story, like a hoax, but the media reported
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.880]   it because the story was too good.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.120]   Right?
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.080]   It just, it fit too many of their preconceptions to me.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:39.920]   There's also one, there's another vector sex, which is live coverage is, um, you know, you
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.840]   really have to be careful because when doing live people will call in and say, Oh, they're
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.280]   at the scene of an accident.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.600]   And then they will do a baba booey or whatever, you know, kind of charades.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.280]   And so without fact checking and without saying, Hey, we haven't confirmed this yet, but these
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.200]   two employees are claiming this people want to get real time coverage.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.880]   It's fine to do real time coverage.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.920]   I think everybody in the audience has to understand so much credit.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.280]   What about the editor?
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.920]   There was a picture and it said Ligma Johnson.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:13.120]   No, that is so lazy.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.800]   Why are you covering for these people?
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.520]   I'm not covering.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.960]   I'm just trying to explain it.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.920]   No, you're missing the point.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.720]   Let me unpack the whole point.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.920]   Let me unpack the whole point.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.440]   There's also, you interrupted me.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.400]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.480]   There is a different standard for live news coverage.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.480]   And then there we've ripped out fact checking from a lot of these publications and basic
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.080]   fact checking and a little bit of time I'm explaining why they make this mistake.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.200]   I'm not protecting them.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.480]   You want to know why they make it?
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.840]   That's part of it.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.320]   But they've also ripped out fact checking and then they are in such a race to get the
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.760]   clicks on social media.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.280]   No, no, here's what's going on.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.520]   If the story fits their priors, they run with it immediately and they don't do any fact
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.160]   checking because they don't want to know that it's not true.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:50.960]   That's what's going on.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.680]   There is an element of that.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.600]   They will check a story if it's a narrative they don't like, because they're gonna make
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.200]   they're gonna try and make sure it's not true.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.320]   Yeah, that's true of both sides.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.760]   And they'll use it as well.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.440]   This thing, there's only one mainstream media.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.280]   This is the mainstream media.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.960]   Who's the alternative?
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.360]   It's Fox.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.160]   What's the alternative?
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.200]   Fox is the number one news network.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.400]   The alternative to the mainstream media is the Substack journalists.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.920]   You think Substack journalists do this?
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.760]   Tell me the writer on Substack who behaves this way.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.800]   There's a lot of different ones there.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.160]   So who got fooled?
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.400]   What Substack writer got fooled by Ligma Johnson?
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.280]   I'm not defending it.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.000]   I'm explaining.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.400]   Matt Taibbi got fooled by Ligma Johnson.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.280]   I don't think so.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.480]   I'm not defending it.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.560]   Don't make me defend Ligma.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.400]   I'm not defending Ligma.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.600]   You're both sidesing it.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.480]   I'm not both sidesing it.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.120]   I'm telling you what is happening in journalism today.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.720]   They have ripped out fact checking and they are in a race to beat each other because the
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   first person to get the story up gets the clicks.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.480]   That's the dysfunctional thing.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.120]   They tried to create a story when there was no story there.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.560]   They went out.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.840]   They went out outside of an office mid-market street.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.560]   And they said, hey, there's this sensational thing happening.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.480]   And there was no sensational thing happening.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:00.880]   Correct.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.200]   And so the little drop that fell into their laps, the little thing that fell into their
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.720]   laps became the story.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.800]   Because that's the story they wanted to see created.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   There was no story beforehand that then that there were all these people being fired, walking
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.280]   out with boxes.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.760]   And then they said, let's go send live TV producers down there.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.680]   They sent the live TV producers down there.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.960]   They did the same thing.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.460]   Manifest.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.520]   They did the same thing in New York at Bear Stearns.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.160]   Story to cover.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.920]   When they had other major layoffs at Bear Stearns and stuff like that during the financial
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.320]   crisis, of course, they sent people to do live coverage.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.040]   Not defending it.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.640]   I'm just explaining to you what's going on in the background as well with live TV and
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.880]   the gutting of newsrooms and having no fact checking.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.080]   A lot of these stories go out.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.720]   But what about the 20 years ago, they used to have a stocky check.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.400]   My 11 year olds and 10 year old the copy editors are better copy editors than these adults
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.040]   at these.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:47.680]   It's crazy.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.880]   Incredible publications.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.480]   My kids started howling.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.040]   They were like, Dad, do you understand what you just said?
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.800]   It'll lick my jaw.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.080]   I mean, come on.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.120]   This is like prepubescent humor that these people fell for.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.880]   It's it's ridiculous.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.080]   It's embarrassing.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.120]   It's certainly embarrassing.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.600]   100%
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.640]   It is embarrassing.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.560]   And this connects with the 4chan board.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.760]   It's the same problem.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.280]   This is a grievance industrial complex, right?
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.200]   They're manufacturing grievances.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.880]   It's funny in the case of Ligma Johnson.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.280]   It's not funny in the case of the 4chan board.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.600]   But these are people who are inventing stories.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.720]   Because there's a certain area to manipulate media because they know it's so easy to manipulate
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.200]   the media.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:25.600]   Right.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.360]   Anyways, big shout out to Rahul Ligma.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.320]   That was a great start.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.760]   Well played, sir.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.560]   Also happens to be a huge fan of the All In podcast, apparently.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.360]   Well played, sir.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.840]   He's welcome on as a bestie guestie anytime he wants.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.120]   Oh, no, well, definitely not.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.360]   All right, we should talk about layoffs and tech lift 13%
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.400]   riff 700 employees like yesterday.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.440]   Stripe 14% riff 1000 employees open door chime,
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.960]   Dapper Labs, all hundreds of employees open door the most significant there 550 18%
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.120]   Dapper 22% and Twitter.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.480]   We'll see what the riff winds up being but that's occurring as we're taping here.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.960]   So and then Jason Apple did a pause.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.080]   Amazon did a pause.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.920]   Right and Google and Facebook have
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:17.600]   Yeah, maybe trying maybe signaling a pause but haven't they've been hiring like in absolutely
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.880]   and in crazy crazy pace and we'll pull up the chart here actually.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.120]   It's instructive to look at Facebook and Google because they have not slowed down
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.280]   by any stretch of the imagination.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.920]   Just by the raw numbers.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.680]   This all started to peak in June and now is starting up again.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:39.520]   So there's a website layoffs dot fyi that's been tracking all these layoffs you can see
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.680]   the number of layoffs these are kind of major layoffs and the number of employees impacted
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:50.080]   been pretty consistent in the third quarter, it started to die down in September.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:56.080]   From the peak in May and June, and now this is gonna be picking up right?
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.880]   Yeah, it feels like this is the double dip we were talking about.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.320]   I think this is the beginning.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.600]   This is not even unpack it.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.520]   Well, I think that we had if you take a very balanced view of what happened this week.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.680]   You have to start, I think, with the Federal Reserve and really what they said is rates
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:17.360]   will probably be higher than all of you think and they'll be higher for longer than all of you want.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:24.000]   And again, without debating whether, you know, that's gonna come to pass or not.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.080]   The thing that you can do is you can build a little sensitivity model to understand the
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.760]   mathematical implication of it.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.680]   And basically what it means is that the dollar that's right in front of you.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.160]   Is now meaningfully more important than the dollar that's far, far away from you.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.360]   So let's just assume.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.480]   That you know the Fed funds rate goes to five and a half percent or so.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.200]   Even five let's go to the optimists and say it's only going to go to five.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.520]   Tech companies have to achieve 500 basis points above that minimum.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:01.520]   So we all have to generate 10 to 11 percent returns for us to be on a risk adjusted basis.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.760]   Better than a government bond.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.480]   The problem with that is all of a sudden, you know, if you're trying to generate cash,
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.080]   even three or four years from now.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.560]   It's not worth that much.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.800]   You need to generate dollars today.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:20.240]   And so, you know, they are really reprioritizing the value of short-term profits.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.080]   And that's going to affect how companies get money.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.680]   The cost of capital.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.680]   So how much dilution you have to take.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.520]   So I think this is what companies are now bearing down for.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.600]   They're realizing, oh, man, I need to get my cost structure way in line.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.440]   It is way better now just to think about this contrast.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.320]   It's way better to grow at 20 percent and be profitable.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:47.280]   Then it is to grow at 100 percent and burn money because it's not clear where that
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.320]   second company is going to get the incremental dollars they need for growth.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.080]   And that's just a mathematical realization when rates are five percent.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.280]   Risk free rates are five percent.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.920]   So this is this is that moment where you see that pivot from pivot growth to profit.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.080]   Yeah, yeah, we can talk.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:07.280]   We've been talking about it for six months, but this is this is this is how it is manifest in
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:13.600]   Silicon Valley companies is of scale is through layoffs and cost reductions and cost savings.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:21.440]   So the investments in future growth are reduced and the timeline to drive greater profits
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.360]   is improved.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:28.240]   I think if what Elon is going to do a Twitter or what is reported.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.240]   So this is nothing to do with anything anyone told me, just what I've read in the reporting
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:37.600]   is accurate that he's going to cut so deep he's going to cut 30, 40, 50 percent potentially of
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.400]   the employee base.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:44.480]   It really sets a new standard for how profitable a tech company can get.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.880]   And again, I'll give credit to a Twitter poster named Postmarket, who I didn't give credit to a
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:55.040]   few weeks ago when I read this tweet, which I think was a good one, which was that Elon's
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.440]   really going to show everyone just how profitable these tech companies can be, just how lean they
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.000]   can be run.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.240]   And, you know, when you're doing a 10 percent riff or a 13 percent riff, you may or may not
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:12.160]   even be getting to profitability with that riff when you cut 30, 40, 50 percent deep and you
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.040]   can actually turn a real profit on a business, an enterprise scale business like a Twitter or
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.840]   like many other enterprise software companies that are out there right now.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:24.320]   It really kind of sets a new standard that a lot of folks might then end up saying, you know
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.000]   what, maybe we should go deeper.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.600]   And there could be the case that private equity firms take a look at this.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.760]   And there's a lot of these distressed mid cap and small cap software companies out there
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:39.440]   that private equity firms now realize, wow, you don't actually need 50 percent of the
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.440]   workforce in order to keep the product running and to drive to profitability.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:49.200]   And you could see a bit of a flurry of buyout activity as more folks come in and maybe try
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.560]   and mimic the Elon playbook.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.000]   So, you know, that's one kind of prediction I think may arise if Elon is successful in
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.200]   making Twitter a much more profitable enterprise.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.440]   It could set a new model that catalyzes a lot of other M&A activity, a lot of other
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.560]   buyout activity of these distressed small and mid cap companies by by other actors.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.000]   Can I build on what you're saying?
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.640]   Nick, could you please just throw up that tweet that I sent just for all of these guys
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.000]   to look at? Because I think it's incredible.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.640]   So to your point, this is an incredible slide.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.840]   This is an incredible slide.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.880]   And essentially what it shows for those folks that are not watching this on YouTube is it
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:31.440]   essentially shows the private software universe and then the public software universe at different
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.800]   levels of valuation.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:39.120]   So as an example, right now there are 15 companies, private companies that are valued greater
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:44.080]   than 10 billion dollars, and there are 40 public ones that are valued greater than 10
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:44.880]   billion.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:51.840]   There are 50 companies between, you know, more than 5 billion, but only 60 that are
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.440]   public that are valued more than 5.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.960]   And here's what's crazy.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:00.800]   There are 400 companies who have an average valuation of 3 billion.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.320]   And then there are already 70 companies in the public markets where they have a billion
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.840]   dollars of next 12 months of revenue.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:15.680]   And it just goes to show you to your point, Freiburg, if these folks have to generate
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.840]   an 11% hurdle rate, their cost of capital is 11%.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:26.800]   The companies on the left will have to go through a lot of very difficult cost cutting,
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:33.360]   potentially headcount reductions, you know, repricing of the product, all kinds of things.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.640]   And many of them have.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.040]   No, none of them have.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.000]   Oh, of these?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.560]   And many of these are on the left.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.000]   Yeah, on the left, right.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.760]   There's almost 500 companies here that have to do an enormous amount of work so that they
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.840]   have a chance to be on the right hand side of this chart.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.840]   The point is that you didn't have to do this when rates were zero.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:57.520]   There was just an abundance of free money and risk seeking and duration that is now
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.560]   out of the market.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:03.120]   Jamal, I think there's also a story that of the 200 companies that are software, public
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.600]   software companies that you see on the right, some number of them will need to go private
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.120]   in order to do the restructuring that the market is demanding that they do in order
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.800]   to get rightly valued.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.360]   And to your point, it will happen at meaningfully lower valuations than where they probably
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:22.480]   went public or their last round, which will put you guys as you guys enormous pressure.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.520]   Yeah, if you guys look at these 200 companies on the right, how many of them do you think
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.360]   go private over the next 18 months to get restructured?
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.960]   Allah, what you want is everyone is possible Twitter.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.200]   18 is 18 months is hard to predict.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.360]   But to your point, freeberg, I think if you look at the number of them that are unprofitable,
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.200]   at least half of them will have difficulty.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.600]   And about so I think about two thirds of these companies really have no line of sight to
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.840]   profitability in the next two to three years.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:55.280]   And again, if you if you layer in this cost of capital argument, all of those companies,
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:03.120]   David will have to raise money at very egregious terms in order to keep themselves going as
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.720]   a public business, in which case their alternative is to go private in a PE transaction.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.040]   So it's probably at least half these businesses.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.560]   I mean, it's a lot.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.240]   I think there's 100 p deals to be done.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.240]   Yeah, 100 by Wow, sex.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:16.800]   What do you think?
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.720]   Because you know, these businesses and the models, I mean, some of them, it's hard to
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.880]   get profitable if you're scaling SAS business, right?
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.920]   Like, you have to get to a certain scale before it's possible.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.240]   Well, I don't, I don't, that's like a very specific question of like, how many of them
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:35.600]   are going to get acquired by PE firms versus going public or going private after being
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.240]   public?
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.840]   That's like a very specific question.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:42.160]   I think the larger point is just that it feels to me like the economy is headed off a cliff
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:42.880]   right now.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:49.600]   I mean, I can tell you within our larger portfolio of companies, like I can see the trajectory.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.680]   So after Q1 board meetings, I would say about two thirds of portfolio companies were hitting
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.680]   their numbers and one third were missing.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.240]   And it still appeared to be like problems related to those specific companies, not a
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.360]   macro trend.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.920]   I would say after Q2 board meetings, two thirds were missing and one third were hitting their
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.240]   numbers.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.680]   And you could start to feel, okay, maybe there's like a macro trend here.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:19.200]   And I would say after Q3 board meetings, like now, the entire portfolio is reforecasting.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.400]   Maybe there's like a handful of companies here or there that aren't, if you're one of
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.840]   those, congratulations.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.080]   But like even the best companies in our portfolio now are seeing major headwinds.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.040]   And this is just, I think, an economy-wide slowdown.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.800]   Do you think there's restructuring possible?
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.600]   I mean, can these companies get...
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.400]   Well, they're going to have...
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.520]   Yeah, because...
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.760]   Let me just ask, in the public markets, do you think those public companies can get restructured
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.920]   as public companies in order to make these profits?
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.200]   Yeah, it just takes the will.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:43.840]   Yes, of course.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:44.160]   It just takes the will.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.200]   It's extremely expensive.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.560]   No, it's expensive.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.520]   I don't even think it's will.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.640]   I think it's just expensive.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.760]   Yeah, I mean...
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.200]   Like look at Coinbase as an example.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.320]   Like look, take Coinbase versus Carvana, right?
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:00.800]   These are both businesses that issued convertible debt sort of right before things got very,
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.760]   very hard.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.840]   And if you look at where their convertible debt trades, it's trading basically at an
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.960]   implied yield of about 12 or 13%, both companies.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.400]   Now, one is probably a legitimate bankruptcy risk, which is Carvana.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.840]   That's what the market would think.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:20.160]   Whereas the other one, I think it has a very fortified balance sheet and could weather
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:20.720]   the storm.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.280]   Coinbase.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:27.440]   But unfortunately, in a moment where rates are, again, the risk-free rate goes to five,
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.720]   five and a half, our cost of capital to do business goes to 10 or 11, these guys have
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.760]   to pay 12 or 13%.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.720]   My gosh, it's really, really dilutive to be in business right now.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.560]   So it just goes to show you that you can stay public.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.440]   But if you want to get incremental money to cover your burn, the only way you can do it
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:53.280]   without really, you know, blowing up your cap table and doing a massive recap will be
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.320]   through convertible debt.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:27:00.320]   But it has a huge overhang and you risk turning the keys over to the debt holders of the company.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:07.120]   So the alternative for that business is to go into the hands of private equity and get
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.520]   out of the spotlight of these public markets.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.520]   But public private equity is very smart.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.160]   And the thing that's happened to them is they can't raise debt.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:17.520]   Right.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.960]   So what do you think they do, they just have to pay 50% less than what they would be willing
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.560]   to pay before because they have to write, you know, 100% equity check.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:31.200]   So there is no free lunch anymore, I think is the big is the big point to point out anywhere
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.240]   in the market right now.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.400]   I think one of the things I'm most concerned about or would be is I was talking with a
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.040]   friend who works at a private, you know, unicorn software company.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.160]   And he we talked about the numbers of the business.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.080]   And I was like, Oh, that company is probably worth x.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.280]   And I gave him a number.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.000]   And then I asked him how much money they've raised, and they've raised more than x.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.440]   So I was like, dude, your options are worthless.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.880]   Like, you know, this is a real problem, I think that's probably going to become very
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:02.560]   systemic for scaled unicorn software companies, what happens to these businesses sacks in
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.920]   the market, you know, as they kind of need another round, but the value of the company
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.360]   is now less than the total cash that they've raised that all is sitting as preferred stock.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:18.640]   Listen, it's survival of the quickest, those who are most willing to adapt the most quickly
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.320]   are going to survive and the ones that are stubborn and refuse to accept the new regime,
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.560]   the market regime are going to die.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.440]   We showed that chart, remember that chart from Sequoia months ago, on this podcast,
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:34.560]   remember that where it basically showed what happens if you're a company that doesn't cut
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.680]   burn until the very end, then you're still gonna run out of money and die.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:43.120]   But if you make the cut right away, quickly, you have enough runway to weather the storm.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:48.640]   And I think that what we've seen is, you know, at my firm craft, yeah, this is exactly it.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.560]   Yeah, we showed this months ago, we've been begging our founders to embrace this.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:58.800]   We did a portfolio, a review with our entire set of founders of our portfolio companies,
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.920]   we did one in February, when we felt the markets were changing.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.960]   And we did another one in May, and we showed the slide.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.120]   And this is the most important thing for founders to internalize, is you have to make
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.400]   the changes quickly.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.240]   You know, one way for them to think about it is, let's say you're a unicorn company, okay?
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:19.920]   And you raised at the peak, let's say second half of 2021, you raised $100 million at a billion
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.800]   dollar valuation.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.280]   And let's say you've got 50 million left in the bank, right?
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.200]   So you've burned 50 million.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.440]   A lot of these founders are thinking that 50 million they've got left is only 5% dilution.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.280]   But that's what it was historically.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.280]   If you were to raise a new round today, you might only be valued at 250.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.200]   So that 50 million you have left is actually 20% dilution.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.560]   And that's if you could even raise, which might be very, very hard.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:47.600]   The most important thing founders can do is forget about the historical terms on which
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.040]   you raise that money.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.360]   Forget about how much money you were burning in the past.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.240]   Just think about how much money you have in the bank today.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:00.640]   Impute a valuation to it, so you really internalize how much dilution that money represents, and
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.880]   then create a new plan moving forward to preserve that cash as long as possible.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.880]   Can I say something else quickly on top of this?
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.560]   I think that's really good advice.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:15.040]   The thing that again, people should do is you should just build a little spreadsheet
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:20.960]   for yourself to understand what the alternative financing options are for people who are in
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.400]   the business of investing.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.840]   So David, to your point, the current three month T-bill rate is 4%.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:32.240]   You can buy munis now between 4% and 5% that are triple tax advantaged.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:36.640]   You can buy high quality corporate bonds that are 6%, 7%, 8%.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.640]   And so it's very...
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.920]   You can buy stocks that have a dividend yield of 5% of growing market leading companies.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.880]   Growing.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.360]   And so all of a sudden...
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.880]   With 5% dividend yield.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:47.280]   Exactly.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.720]   And so all of a sudden, like turning around and giving it to a company where there is
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:56.720]   no end in sight in terms of it doesn't get you to profitability is a really, really hard
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.200]   thing to do.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:03.360]   I was talking to an entrepreneur, David Soloff, just yesterday, and he said it really well.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.560]   He's like, listen, you know, I'm not a macro economist.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:10.480]   I'm not trying to forecast, but he's like what I understood yesterday.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.960]   This is David talking about the Fed as an entrepreneur.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.160]   The angle of attack has changed.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.080]   The Fed has said this is not going to be some triangle sawtooth.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:24.960]   It's not going to go up sharply and then come back down sharply, which is what we would
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.360]   all want if we wanted things to get back to normal sooner.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:34.560]   The angle of attack is now a little bit slower, which means it's going to take longer to get
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.360]   where we need to be.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.560]   And then we're going to stay there for a lot longer than we want.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:43.360]   And when you roll those two things together, a lot of companies may run out of money.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:49.040]   And so if you can't get to default alive, you have to look at your cost structure and
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:54.240]   figure out how to right size this thing, because the cost of capital is just going to be really,
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.200]   really expensive.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.480]   And this was the Fed's goal, right?
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.400]   They want to take away this free capital, they want to slow the economy down.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.240]   And it seems like they're making progress.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.440]   They did the 75 basis point hike this week.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:11.920]   But we're adding jobs to the economy, we have more job openings, and we had 2.6% GDP growth.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:18.000]   So I guess my question to the everybody here is, what is the Fed going to have to do?
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.400]   Or can they stop this consumer and this growth?
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.680]   It's very strange, right?
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:30.400]   Paolo Paolo said, he'd rather overcorrect and break things because he has a toolbox to fix
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.760]   the broken bones.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:36.880]   But he doesn't have a toolbox to fix if they under correct, and they have rampant inflation.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:43.360]   I mean, not more explicit, you can't get Jason, so he's going to take rates until demand is
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.320]   destroyed, and enough demand is destroyed, such that inflation is tamed.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.880]   But that has huge implications to all of us, because we all have to do our job, trying to
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.920]   build a company, trying to raise money, trying to invest money.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.640]   It's just getting much, much, much harder than I even thought.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.800]   So like, you know, for me, I'm like, wow, I thought that we could get through the worst
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.400]   of this by mid 23.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:11.200]   But now you have to plan for the worst, which means, okay, now I'm thinking that men rates
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:16.240]   could be higher for much longer, which means, you know, we could be in this market till
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.280]   early 25.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.480]   And you may say, hey, that's way too conservative.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.280]   Yeah, but you have to plan for conservatism in this point.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.280]   So how do I invest money right now?
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.040]   Honestly, I'm like, I should just put more into T bills.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.400]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.280]   If a company's like H math can have another 10 15 20 million bucks?
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.960]   I'm like, wow, I mean, I don't think that that gets you anywhere.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.600]   And oh, by the way, that 10 or $20 million, I can generate 4%.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.880]   What a tough trade off, right?
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:47.360]   For Well, for somebody who has access to private markets, which should be high growth companies
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:53.680]   to take the guaranteed for over the 50 x 25 x 10 x, whatever we're trying to bet on here.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:58.080]   Yeah, it's not just the guaranteed for but if you want to take tech risk, then you could
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.760]   go buy the corporate bonds of some high quality companies for the 10 or 11%.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.280]   So you take moderate risk.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.200]   So you're also competing with that not to zero risk.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.560]   Can you explain that for the listeners what that corporate debt is and why it, you know,
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.280]   pays more?
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.760]   There are there are, you know, high quality public companies, tech companies that have
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.760]   bonds, and that's corporate debt.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.480]   And they obviously have to pay a higher rate than what the Treasury pays, because the Treasury
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.440]   is is risk free.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.520]   And corporations could default.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.560]   So there is some risk to it.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.600]   It's not zero risk.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.760]   But, you know, it's like, if you're willing to take tech risk, then why wouldn't you buy
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.560]   a bond at 10%?
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.080]   Meaning the equity always has to beat that threshold return.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.920]   But But hey, can we just go back to the jobs report for a second?
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:42.320]   I mean, the US government could default, but it's considered the least likely to default
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.400]   of all issuers of debt in the world.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:50.720]   And that's why I said, yeah, that's why people call it the risk free rate, because it is
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.440]   the least risky,
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:56.000]   the US can always repay its debt, because the debt is denominated in dollars, and the
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.360]   Treasury can always at the end of the day, print more money that would just be monetizing
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.080]   the debt.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:05.600]   Other countries that owe money in dollars, and obviously don't control the US Mint, they
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.240]   can't do that.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.520]   So they could actually default.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.640]   But since we're the world's reserve currency, we're never going to default.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:15.440]   However, the dollars that you get paid back by the US government might be worth a lot
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.200]   less in the future because of inflation.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.120]   And that's the real risk you have to think about.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.520]   But there's no default risk, right?
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.280]   Whereas with corporate debt, there is.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.640]   But let's go back to this, the jobs picture for a second.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.240]   Jason, you asked about this.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:32.400]   So there is news this morning that we added 261,000 jobs in October.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.640]   And obviously, given that there's an election in a few days, then the administration is
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.240]   eager to point to this.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:42.640]   But if you dig a little deeper in the report, I just posted the link there, you see in the
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:48.000]   raw numbers that there's actually 328,000 fewer employed Americans.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.400]   And the number of unemployed Americans actually increased to 36,000.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:58.960]   And the labor force participation rate declined for the third consecutive month to 62.2%.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:03.040]   So I don't really understand how all these numbers add up.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.600]   But the point is, the data is very mixed.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.800]   And there's definitely a negativity in there.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:15.840]   And this feels to me like the last gasp of the bull market where there's this residual
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.120]   job creation.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:21.200]   But you look at just what's happened in the last week, where it's stripe cutting.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.600]   I mean, stripe's probably the single highest quality, I think it's probably the most valuable
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.280]   private company in Silicon Valley.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:27.600]   SpaceX.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.640]   No, SpaceX is.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.840]   Oh, well, SpaceX, okay.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:34.240]   But like software, pure software company, they had a 14% cut, you're starting to see
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.560]   now the rifts really start to pile up.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:41.920]   So I think we're at the beginning now of a long cycle of the unemployment rate going
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:42.160]   up.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.840]   I mean, it just feels like the economy is slowing so fast.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.560]   The markets are, you know, they've been puking now for six months.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:54.080]   It just feels like this is the beginning of a like really serious recession.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:58.240]   Yet we had GDP growth, yet we had job openings.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.320]   No, remember we had two quarters of net negative GDP growth.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.640]   This is when we had the debate about what a recession is.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:09.440]   It was true that if you looked at growth in nominal terms, it appeared to be strong, and
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.640]   then it was net negative once you subtracted the inflation rate.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:17.600]   You know, we said several months ago, my prediction was a double-dip recession where you had this
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.400]   shallow technical recession, then it bounced back in Q3.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.320]   But now I think we're headed into the second part of it, which is the real recession, a
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.720]   recession characterized by joblessness.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.600]   And you're starting to see economists say we're going to go from 3.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.000]   Something percent unemployment rate to say five or 6% unemployment next year.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.480]   So I think we're just beginning to see the job cuts start to add up.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:44.160]   This is, I think this is what Powell meant, which is, you know, he'll take it as far as
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:50.000]   it takes, and then he can fix it on the back end by reintroducing, you know, quantitative
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.680]   easing and reintroducing lower interest rates to stimulate demand.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.760]   But there is one of the odds he gets this right.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.600]   It seems to me that the Fed has a habit of reacting too slowly.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.480]   They were too slow to react to inflation.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:08.240]   My guess is that they'll be too slow to react to the recession.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.480]   So we'll end up with a period of rates being higher than they should too long, and then
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:16.320]   they will correct, they'll drop rates, but that could be two years from now.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.000]   And meanwhile, we could be in a pretty deep recession.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.720]   I think you're probably right.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.960]   Here are the two charts for you to look at the GDP by quarter.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.760]   And then after that, the labor participation rate.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:30.560]   So there's your GDP, q1 q2 being negative q3 bouncing back, we'll see what happens in
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.200]   q4.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.600]   Here's your Fed force participation rate for labor, as we discussed,
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.440]   the thing with the labor participation rate that we're still not sort of like truly factoring
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.880]   in is like, you know, we had a million Americans die because of COVID.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:48.080]   And, you know, starting in that Trump presidency, we lost like seven or 8 million immigrants.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:52.000]   So those 8 million people have a huge effect on this number.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.640]   Yeah, right.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.560]   And it's not properly really factored in.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.960]   Because if, if, if you see that at the start of the Trump presidency, it's just it just
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.160]   fell off a cliff, basically.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.760]   And you also have people who retired early, that was a big trend.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.920]   And this all peaked in 2000.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.920]   Labor participation hit that like 67 68%, I think is the peak.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:15.120]   And just slowly going down as boomers retire early, because they made so much on their
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.320]   401ks and homes.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:21.600]   And then you're right, trim off, we've had negative, we've really cut immigration the
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:26.800]   last whatever, five, six years, I think there's an element in here that's missing on how much
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:32.160]   people individually are finding other ways to earn income that doesn't qualify and show
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.440]   up in the labor force numbers.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:39.520]   People have set up Etsy stores, Shopify stores have tripled since COVID.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:45.600]   People are making more money on YouTube on Instagram on Tick Tock than ever before.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:52.160]   There's a whole new class of work that revolves around the individual, creating their own
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:57.600]   business creating their own income stream that simply taken off and has taken off.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.360]   It was it was kind of a trend pre COVID.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.760]   But it really took off during COVID.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:05.440]   And there's an element of this that's really more about the transition of how people work
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.160]   and how they earn.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.400]   That isn't reflected in these numbers.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.720]   I don't think that the idea that everyone should go be an employee at a company is necessarily
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.040]   the right way to think about labor going forward.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.680]   The amount of money that individuals are earning is probably the better way to frame this up
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:24.000]   going forward and really thinking about the earning power and the economic health of this
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:24.320]   country.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.040]   This is something important you're bringing up here.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.880]   Gig workers are about 9% of the workforce.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:35.680]   And Uber and Dara had they grew over 70% this year.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.640]   But I think the big number that I watched for was drivers are making $36 an hour in
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.320]   the United States working for Uber.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.360]   So you're exactly right.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.360]   People are finding other options, whether it's DoorDash, Uber, and that doesn't qualify
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.320]   in labor force, right?
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.360]   Because they're no, it does.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.760]   Independent contractors are counted.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.960]   Yeah, they are counted.
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.600]   That's based on my preliminary research.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.600]   If somebody wants to fact check us, that'd be great.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:02.320]   But my understanding is independent contractors, which is what gig workers are classified under
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.840]   are counted in labor participation.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.600]   I don't know how they're counted.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.080]   So we'll look that up and figure that out.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:15.280]   There was a story in BBC that the Bank of England has now warned that the UK is facing
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.640]   its longest recession since records began.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.320]   Some of this is getting to be fear porn.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.620]   Yeah.
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:25.760]   But look, here's what I think is scary about going into a recession is number one, you
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.760]   don't really know how long it's going to take to get out.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.840]   We know the average recession lasts about 18 months.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.080]   But the truth is once it starts, you just don't know.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.280]   And the second thing is you don't really know who's been stress tested.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.160]   People claim that they can weather the storm.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:43.360]   But the truth is that there's no way to simulate, truly simulate a stress test.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.560]   They claim they can.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:49.840]   But the only way is to really subject an institution to that pressure and that stress.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.400]   And then you see if they come out the other side.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.640]   So that's the issue is you're just going into this.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.600]   There's a lot of unknown unknowns.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:03.680]   And this is why I would just urge founders to be cautious is because if the recession
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.200]   ends up being shallower and shorter than people expect, great.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.960]   You'll be surprised to the upside.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:13.760]   But if the recession ends up being deeper and longer than expected, you don't want to
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.320]   go out of business.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.680]   You want to be protected against that.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.120]   So again, we've been saying this since February and May.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:24.880]   But again, I just reiterate, I think it really makes sense for founders to be conservative,
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:28.000]   prioritize your survival above all else.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.640]   This recession probably will last about two years.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.640]   You want to make sure you survive it.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.840]   And to Shama's point, if you survive it with lower growth, that's fine.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.920]   You can keep growing on the other end of this thing.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:41.920]   But if you go out of business, because you grew too fast, then you're not going to get
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.560]   the chance to fix that problem when the recession is over.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:51.040]   I just don't see anybody rewarding hyper growth that is burning a ton of cash where you have
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.720]   to be back in market every year.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:59.680]   Because it's just very hard to feel comfortable that the conditions on the field aren't going
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.400]   to be drastically different a year from now, right?
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.080]   It's not like we know that it's going to be better or worse.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.440]   And I think that that uncertainty is actually really bad for companies.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:15.600]   So to your point, it's just like a lot of folks have tried to shy away, David, from
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.200]   actually revisiting their valuations.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:21.680]   They've done these complicated converts, and they've tried to basically, you know,
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:26.560]   it's I think it's sort of like managing their ego or the board's ego.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:32.800]   And I think like the next shoe to drop has to be these founders and these boards just
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.640]   saying, OK, let's just take the hard medicine.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.440]   What's the real market clearing price and valuation?
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.800]   Let's get a third party to price it.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.840]   And let's get new fresh equity and then move forward.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:46.720]   Because if you don't do that, and you wait until everybody's trying to do it, then it's
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.160]   going to be a really tough scenario.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:53.040]   So better to your point, you know, this is why like Stripe, it's so smart, better to
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:53.680]   cut now.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.880]   Again, it's always hard to let people go.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.240]   But it's better to do that now than 18 months from now.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.960]   Because you just have no idea how much more expensive or hard it's going to be then.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:09.520]   And who's going to even be in the business of lending money or investing money in 18
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:10.020]   months.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.480]   And you know, that that sounds pretty crazy.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.240]   But it's like, I think that that's, that's the moment that we're in to your point,
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.000]   Friedberg, I did a little research here.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:27.440]   And according to the Fed of St. Louis, if you counted casual workers, informal workers,
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:34.560]   over doing over 20 hours a week of informal work, aka gig work, you would increase labor
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.680]   participation between a half point and a point if you counted all of them, maybe even slightly
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.200]   more than two percentage points higher.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:46.000]   So probably about a point seems like a realistic way to look at labor participation.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   And of the eight points, or maybe now the six or seven points to 10%, it would then
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.560]   account for 10 to 20% of the 10% drop in labor participation.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:02.880]   It's just alarming statistics, because if most people have most of their personal net
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:07.280]   worth tied up in their home asset, and their home values are declining, or going to decline.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:14.480]   And we're seeing this dramatic spike in consumer credit in the US, it paints a really ugly
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.000]   picture for the next two years.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.360]   Wow, guys, I'm just looking at I'm just looking at the markets today, get labs down 15% snowflakes
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.240]   down 13%.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.800]   Monday's down 14%.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.680]   At last, it's down 30%.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.560]   In one day, Yelp is down 17%.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:33.120]   These are open door is down 16%.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.760]   So it's just a horror.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:41.920]   Oh my gosh, the cloud computing index, WCLD has hit a new low for the year, it's down to
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:46.400]   23 bucks, I think the previous low was 25 is down almost 8% today.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.040]   And this is on a day in which the NASDAQ is down less than 1%.
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.720]   So the point is,
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.440]   People are rotating out of growth stocks.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.640]   Yeah, it's just brutal.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.240]   And so, listen, if you're a startup founder, you got to realize these are like some of
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.360]   the highest quality public
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.520]   Twilio is down 40% today.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.360]   Twilio is down 37% in a day today.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.420]   Whoa.
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:12.400]   But guys, this is this is just math, you know, it's not a judgment on any of these companies,
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.680]   it's just pure math.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.360]   This is why I think you have to be utterly unemotional in this moment.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:22.080]   And if you're if you're a CEO, running a company, particularly a SaaS business,
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.880]   you have to really figure out how to
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:31.040]   how to right size your cost basis and make this money last profitable industrial companies are
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:31.280]   up.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:35.760]   Bill Gurley had a tweet a tweet about this a few months ago about how the biggest mistake
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.880]   people make in riffs is they just do like a tepid riff, like a 10% ish riff, and they have
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.160]   to come back and they do it again.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.360]   And they do it again.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:48.160]   This is what I think the the Elon action this week really sets a standard, he shows the
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:53.440]   entirety of Silicon Valley, that you can cut deep and you can turn a profit and you can do it fast.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:57.680]   And it could set a new standard for how folks are managing this jack Welch used to in his
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:02.160]   management principles, recommend dropping the bottom 10% of people every year.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:07.840]   And so, you know, the 10 13% cuts don't really pass muster as a public market investor kind
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.240]   of looks at the the management across these different companies to turn a profit, they're
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.880]   going to say the folks that are making the deepest cuts, the fastest are the ones that
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.080]   are going to get valued.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:20.480]   It's unfortunate, and it's a difficult circumstance for everyone in Silicon Valley to deal with
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.480]   from the employees, to the investors to the public and private shareholders.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.520]   It's really brutal.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.080]   One quick question.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:29.920]   It's really just this kind of market motivation that's underway right now.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.040]   Here's the chart.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.520]   And my question for you is when do Google and Facebook stop this?
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:39.760]   I mean, if you look at the number of employees being added, it is truly extraordinary.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.560]   Here's the chart.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.560]   And this includes the latest quarter.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:48.240]   So they are not turning off hiring yet.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.440]   What do you think?
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.360]   Hold on, didn't they announce a hiring freeze?
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:56.480]   They announced that they were at Google, they announced that they were going to hold people
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.760]   accountable to better performance, and they were going to go do more with less.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.960]   And then they added more people.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:03.520]   Facebook said they would do a hiring freeze.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.520]   And they added jobs.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.520]   They added jobs last quarter, yeah.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.080]   Well, you're right.
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.600]   They just announced a hiring freeze.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:14.160]   You look at Apple, Apple just announced in non-R&D functions a hiring freeze.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.920]   This is Apple, like the most valuable, most profitable company in the world.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:23.840]   So if Apple basically is putting the brakes on non-engineering hiring, that tells you
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.760]   something about how fast the economy is slowing down.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.160]   I think that was a huge signal.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:32.160]   The point Freeber makes is, you know, I think it's a good thing that Apple is doing this.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:37.120]   The point Freeber makes is so correct, which is, if you're doing a RIF, obviously there's
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:42.720]   a reason why, but I think we're seeing too many RIFs where the details of the RIF and
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.720]   the magnitude of the RIF don't match up with what the objective of the RIF is.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:51.840]   The objective of the RIF for a lot of these companies should be to get them cash flow
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:57.760]   positive, or at least to put them on a runway or trajectory where they can get cash flow
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.720]   positive with their existing cash on the balance sheet, right?
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.080]   They won't need to raise money again.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:06.160]   And we're seeing a lot of companies where they don't achieve that, and they have to
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.200]   come back again and again and hit it again.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:14.320]   And that creates more turmoil for the company, and it's more unfair for the employees.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.720]   By the way, Sax, to that point, I'll just say how deep these companies are cutting and
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:24.080]   how quickly management is expressing to their shareholders how they're going to turn a profit
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:28.080]   becomes a signal for those shareholders on whether or not they want to stay in that stock.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:32.480]   And the companies that are doing it fast and are doing it deep, the investors and the shareholders
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.520]   say you do actually have a path that makes sense here, I'm going to stay in the stock
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.600]   cash today versus cash in the future.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:41.280]   Charles, let me ask you a question in terms of strategy for one of these companies, let's
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:48.720]   say the Facebook Corporation, or perhaps even Google, or Apple, even if they were to cut
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.680]   their expenses, which might take obviously a RIF.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:56.400]   And then because their stock prices are so depressed right now, maybe even a mid cap
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:01.520]   one like a Twilio or an Uber or an Airbnb, they were cut costs and then start buying
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.400]   back their shares, which some companies have been doing.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.160]   What would that do in terms of the markets appreciation of those stocks or management
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:08.480]   teams?
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.600]   I think it's hard to tell.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:17.680]   I think that the if you have not lost investor trust, I think it would be really well rewarded.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:27.920]   If you have become unreliable and undisciplined, even those cuts, I think would be met with
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:33.280]   some amount of excitement, but probably not a broad based support.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:39.360]   So, you know, it then it just goes to narrative, meaning if Google did it, I think that people
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.280]   really trust Sundar and Ruth.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:44.160]   And I think the stock would go bonkers.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:50.240]   They would they would probably move very quickly into the echelon of Apple and Apple is sort
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:55.360]   of a first among equals like they're just they're just in a different class unto themselves.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:01.040]   Facebook, I think is a little bit harder because I think folks have gotten burned and, you
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.520]   know, they would have to make some really, really deep cuts.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.600]   But then, you know, where do you do it?
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.680]   You can't capitulate on this meta strategy.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.400]   But then the other part is where you make all the money.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:14.560]   And so you have this huge morale issue that you have to manage.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:17.040]   So it's just a really hard game to play.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:20.560]   Just one more thought on on on the RIF stuff.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:25.600]   I think one thought experiment for founders is to think about what was your plan at the
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:26.800]   end of 2019?
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.240]   Why do I say that?
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:34.000]   Because 2020 and 2021 were two of the most distorted years ever in the history of financial
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.480]   markets and the economy because we had COVID and then we had the reaction to COVID.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:38.720]   Right.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:43.600]   And so you saw there was this, you know, Zoom's market cap hit 100 billion, all the
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.840]   e-commerce companies were doing extremely well.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:50.080]   You know, you had all this money printing, you know, you had zero interest rates and
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:50.960]   so on.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:54.400]   You had SaaS companies hitting all-time highs at the end of 2021.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.040]   So we lived through this incredibly distorted time.
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:02.880]   So as a thought experiment, go look at what your plan for 2020 was supposed to be when
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.040]   you created it at the end of 2019.
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:10.080]   Because that was the last time that you were thinking without any distortions, you know,
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:11.200]   that were then created.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:16.320]   And I think if you were to go back and look at your 2020 plan, again, created at the end
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:21.600]   of 2019, you'd probably see that you could get by with half the headcount you have now
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:25.360]   because probably you doubled your headcount during the last two years during these heady,
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:26.560]   heady times.
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:30.480]   And yet I think founders start thinking, "Oh, I can't go back to operating, you know,
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.880]   I can't operate at half the level of headcount."
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:37.600]   But you were, you were operating with half the level of headcount by definition at some
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.560]   earlier point.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:43.200]   I also think sometimes I think what founders say is, "What will people think if I cut 50%?"
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:47.680]   Meaning all of a sudden the perceived success of my business would be different.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:52.480]   And I think that this is where you have to realize, no, like there's a lot of ego tied
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:56.560]   up in these things, which slows people down from doing the thing that they need to do.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.120]   It's a really, it's a really hard spot.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.000]   It's hard to do.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.160]   I mean, look at Airbnb as an example.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:07.040]   I mean, they did this ginormous riff during COVID because they had no choice.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.000]   I mean, their revenue went essentially to zero.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.640]   And now the business is incredibly strong.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.960]   It's throwing off massive amounts of free cash flow.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.760]   And the stock market seems to really love what Airbnb has done.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:22.800]   And a similar story over at Uber in terms of having done significant riffs and probably
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.400]   could do significant ones going forward.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.760]   Yeah, but Jacob, let's just be clear.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.880]   Airbnb is still down almost 75% off its high.
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:29.760]   Right.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.200]   So when you say the stock market, love it.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:36.960]   So they're up today 3%, so meaning they're not down 30% in one day, but they have gone
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:37.920]   down with the rest of the market.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.920]   They have gone down with the rest of the market.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:43.840]   But it feels like the business I'm talking about the business fundamentals when you're
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:46.400]   throwing off almost a billion dollars of free cash flow.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.960]   Yeah, now you're going to start people are going to perceive that business maybe as
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.320]   of this cohort, the flight to safety, right?
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.320]   Or same thing with Uber throwing off free cash flow.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.840]   Now, I think a lot of these names are going to I don't own Airbnb right now, but I do
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:58.640]   own Uber.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.360]   I think the people throwing off the free cash flow are going to look pretty attractive
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.240]   and be able to buy their stock back maybe.
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.720]   All right, everybody, let's talk about the midterms.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:15.360]   A lot of big Senate races and obviously governors, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin,
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.840]   Ohio, all really important races.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.120]   sex, what do you think?
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:24.480]   Well, it looks to me like there's gonna be a republican wave, there was an interesting
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:28.960]   article actually on CNN, where they it's called five scary numbers for Democrats.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:37.360]   And what they point to is that Biden right now has a 42% approval rating.
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:40.800]   61% of the American people say he hasn't focused on the key problems.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.200]   So this is called the out of touch index.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.960]   51% say the economy is no issue compared to only 15% for abortion.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:49.200]   And then 78% say we're on the wrong track.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:53.440]   I don't think I've seen a right track wrong track index that was so negative.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:57.360]   And 75% of the country says we're in a recession.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:02.240]   So you know, when you look at polling numbers like that, it must translate, I think, into
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:08.080]   a republican wave and you have now real clear politics currently has the GOP gaining four
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:08.720]   Senate seats.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:13.680]   So winning in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and New Hampshire, that's a big change from just
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:16.480]   a couple weeks ago, and winning 31 house seats.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.920]   So this is this is kind of what it's looking like right now.
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:25.760]   But look, the margin is still within the within the margin of error on the polling.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:31.200]   So Nate Silver's pointed out that within one standard deviation, you could either have
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:35.520]   a republican wave or you could have basically the republicans fizzle out.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.440]   So it's going to be very close.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:40.880]   But ultimately, I think this breaks republican.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:47.520]   Yeah, the to me, the way that I've I'm looking at it right now is that it seems like most
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.560]   scenarios, the republicans will have the majority in the house.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:54.000]   And the real question is what happens in the Senate.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.840]   It's really, really kind of a coin flip.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.280]   And that's going to be really interesting to see.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:04.560]   So, you know, things where I thought would break republican in the Senate, like Pennsylvania
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.440]   are now back to almost the, you know, a statistical dead heat.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:13.920]   So it's a really interesting moment, actually, it's, but most scenarios, David, I think you'd
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.200]   agree is that the republicans win the house.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.880]   And then there's a non there's a plurality of scenarios where they also in the Senate,
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.120]   the house will almost certainly go republican.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:28.160]   But I think the Senate now the official percentages are 55% likely to tip republican.
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:33.920]   But I just think that in a wave year like this, where the wrong track sentiment is so
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:38.880]   high, I think all these races that are a dead heat, they're more likely to break in one
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:43.840]   direction as opposed to like a random distribution, which is why I think you could just as easily
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:51.440]   end up with an, you know, instead of it being a 51 49 Senate, it could be 5545.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.040]   Because all these things could break the same way.
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:58.480]   So right now, so I would slightly disagree in Pennsylvania, I think Oz has improved as
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.240]   a candidate Fetterman did that debate.
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:03.120]   And since he suffered that stroke, he kind of came across as somebody
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.640]   how do we feel about that?
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:08.560]   That I, I had very, very hard to watch that happen.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:09.760]   And yeah,
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.520]   I mean, the guy, the guy has suffered a stroke and is sad, but he you know, he doesn't
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:16.000]   present as someone who can be a senator right now.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.600]   I think Oz is gonna win that race.
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:18.880]   What does the science say about that?
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:23.440]   Like, are we as a society, is this a good idea to have somebody post stroke be in office?
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.640]   I'm not picking any political side here.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.560]   I'm just talking about the medical issue.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.920]   Oz is actually doing the right thing right now, which is he's not actually focusing on
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:34.240]   that issue, because it's so obvious, he doesn't want to be seen as beating up on Fetterman.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.840]   And instead, he's focusing on the issues.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:42.720]   And actually, Fetterman's issues are very unpopular in a state like Pennsylvania.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:47.600]   So I actually think for both reasons, Oz is going to win that I think Fetterman's manifestly
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:50.400]   unqualified, but also I think his positions are fairly unpopular.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:54.080]   So I think Pennsylvania will will will almost certainly tip.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:57.840]   So let me pull up the chart here, just so people can see Ohio's going Republican.
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:02.560]   And then Arizona, I think is really the interesting one where Blake Masters is now
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:06.320]   tied after being behind Mark Kelly throughout this campaign.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:08.720]   He is now tied in Newport.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.280]   He's tied now?
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.960]   Oh God, he's so unpopular.
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:12.560]   Your guy is really unpopular.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:13.760]   And now he's tied.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:15.040]   It's popular.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.280]   Jake, that was your interpretation.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.320]   It's a Peter Taylor.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:23.520]   He was he was doing really poorly, I think, because I think, listen, I think that I think
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:26.160]   that Arizona is probably gonna be the closest race in the country.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.360]   I think it's gonna be a nail biter.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.640]   But I think Blake's gonna pull that out.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:34.640]   Saks, what do you think are the biggest policy shifts that take place in this country?
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:37.280]   Post this predicted red wave?
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.360]   Is there anything that changes?
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:44.160]   So just, you know, talk to folks about what's on the docket from a legislative point of view,
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:48.800]   going into the next Congress, with all these new candidates,
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:52.640]   the reality is we have a separation of powers in this country, and you're going to have
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:57.040]   divided government, the Republicans will will control Congress, the Democrats will control
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:58.160]   the presidency.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:01.840]   And so as a result, you're going to be largely in a gridlock situation.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:05.520]   But gridlock may be a lot better than what we've had over the last couple of years.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:09.520]   So, you know, you've had basically this orgy of spending and money printing,
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:11.280]   and I think that's going to stop, obviously.
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:15.200]   The other thing that's going to happen is Republicans may not be able to pass much
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:17.600]   legislation, but they're gonna be able to do investigations.
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:21.600]   And there's a lot of questions that need to be answered, I think, about still about COVID,
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:26.480]   you know, these lockdown policies that we had, it started at the top at NIH, why did they happen?
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:30.400]   We need to start having accountability for some of these horrible decisions that were
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.600]   made during COVID.
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:34.240]   And there's been no willingness in Washington to hold anyone accountable.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:38.880]   At a minimum, they need to have some congressional investigations and find out why we pursued
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:41.360]   such bad policies over the last couple of years.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:46.960]   By the way, did you see did you see what happened this week where the CDC, you know, after this
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:52.800]   entire opioid epidemic, and all of these lawsuits, the CDC came out and actually said, Hey, listen,
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:59.040]   we need to really make sure that we're getting access, putting opioids in the hands of Americans
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.920]   who are really suffering with pain management and whatnot.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:05.120]   And I didn't read the article to really understand the details.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:09.360]   But I just thought it was an incredible headline where it's like, it's just it's so counter to
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:12.880]   the narrative of what we've been told is happening, which is like, you know, over prescription and
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.080]   misprescription.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:19.760]   If we learned anything during COVID is to question every organization, everybody and to really
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.440]   collect your own information.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:26.560]   While, you know, looking at these organizations, we trusted over time, I know, I look at the
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:31.280]   world differently now that you couldn't say COVID was possibly a lab leak without having
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:34.400]   your podcast taken down or being banned on YouTube.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.680]   And now ProPublica has done an investigation.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.720]   And they're saying along with Vanity Fair, and they're going to win a Pulitzer for this, I bet
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:46.320]   that this conspiracy theory from two years ago is probably actually the leading theory and that
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:54.800]   the Wuhan lab lab was showing, if you didn't see it, reporting an incident in late November of
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.920]   last year before COVID broke 2019.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.360]   It's really, it's really incredible.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:04.240]   There was an article in the Atlantic that came out over the past week called let's declare a
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.920]   pandemic amnesty.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.420]   No.
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.800]   And let's do a pandemic investigation.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:09.600]   Right.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:14.880]   So basically, yes, all the experts who told us, Jason, that we weren't allowed to have an
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:19.520]   opinion, because we weren't expert enough, that if we raise any questions about the origin of the
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.040]   virus, that it might have come from a lab, that that basically needs to be censored.
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:26.800]   The people who said we had to do lockdowns and implement all these authoritarian tactics.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.920]   Now they're saying that they need an amnesty.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.080]   And what that really means, no one's looking, no one's looking to criminally prosecute them.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:37.360]   What we're looking to do is have some accountability around the public policy.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:41.760]   What they want is they want to pull the expert card to say that they're the only ones who get
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.520]   to have an opinion and make a decision.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:47.520]   But then when it all goes horribly awry, they basically want to be completely insulated and
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:48.000]   unaccountable.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.440]   No accountability.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.480]   No way, no way.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.880]   We're not going to give you full investigation.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:53.840]   We're in alignment on this.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:54.240]   That's right.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.680]   Can I just tell you why?
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.400]   I just want to say, sex, we're in alignment on this for a rare moment of peace on this podcast.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.480]   The same thing after 911.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:05.520]   Shouldn't all Americans understand what happened after 911?
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:08.640]   And what the failures were in our intelligence, just so we can get better.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.800]   I'm not picking a political horse here.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:16.080]   But it's kind of crazy that you could people said to our podcast and other people who were
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.000]   questioning it, forget about what political party you're in just want to understand how
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.200]   the world works.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:25.520]   What are the chances that this breaks out in the one or two places where they're studying
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.440]   the coronavirus that you have a lab leak?
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.280]   It was so obvious to everybody.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.600]   The other reason why you need to have accountability for this is that there is still a long tail,
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.760]   especially around the damage that we did to our kids educationally.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.480]   Yes, now, and now the over prescription of stimulants.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:46.480]   And so if you don't have answers, you can't go after these problems like there was a there
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:52.640]   was the like, stimulant prescription is now the single biggest epidemic in children.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:57.920]   It is now twice as prescribed as contraceptives and asthma drugs.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.880]   And why Chamath?
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.120]   Why are we doing this to get them to score higher on a test to be more attentive in school?
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:09.200]   Well, it's actually this negative feedback loop where these children were miseducated
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.480]   during COVID.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:16.960]   It had huge psychological and academic damage to them.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:22.560]   Our test scores have fallen off of a clip relative to how we used to do relative to
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.280]   other countries.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:27.440]   I think the teachers unions have found a way to try to explain it.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:32.320]   To basically shield themselves from any sort of critique.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:37.520]   And so the loop and then part of that loop is then to look at a bunch of kids that are
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.880]   underperforming in school. And instead of saying, well, maybe these lockdowns and masking
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:46.560]   and all of these things that we implemented, actually had a huge impact.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.320]   They say, you know, you're misbehaving.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.400]   So let's put you on a stimulant.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.200]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.480]   We're in that loop right now.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:55.040]   Just so you guys know, the data is outrageous.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:02.080]   Twice as many prescriptions for stimulants as the sum of contraceptives and asthma drugs
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.840]   for all American kids.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.400]   Yeah, it's not that suddenly everybody's got ADHD.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.360]   It's and we failed them.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.600]   We failed our children.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.680]   And we're going to use stimulants to have them catch up.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:16.880]   We know, but we should be doing summer schools, after school programs, we can whatever, we
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.880]   failed them because of our response to COVID.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.560]   That is why we need answers to all that stuff.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:24.480]   Because you need to link these things together to have some real accountability.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.040]   Absolutely.
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.520]   Here is the just so we have the people see the numbers.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:32.160]   Here's the 538 poll of how Joe Biden's popularity has switched.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:38.880]   This is 654 days into his presidency started out really strong 54%.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.760]   And now a little rebound since the summer.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.880]   Obviously, that dip started with the economy, it's the economy stupid.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.720]   And if we go down a little bit on the same page, and you zoom in on the left there, you
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.920]   can see compared to Donald Trump.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:55.600]   He started out much more popular than Donald Trump day by day.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.360]   And now he's just as unpopular as Donald Trump was at this point in his presidency.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.320]   Well, look, I mean, look, the setup is really interesting for 2024.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.240]   Because it's probably going to be the case that we're in the middle of a recession going
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.360]   into that election cycle.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.720]   Maybe we'll be sort of like getting ourselves out of it.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.440]   But there'll be a lot of economic damage, high unemployment.
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:19.440]   And, you know, typically, folks in power will have to sort of be held accountable for that.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:25.360]   It's a really interesting setup that both Gavin Newsom and Ron DeSantis have to figure
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.640]   out now and navigate if they're going to get the nomination on each side.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:32.240]   And breaking news today, Saks would love to get your thoughts on this.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:38.000]   Axios says, and we'll go to Science Corner next, that Trump's going to announce on November
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.800]   14, that he is running for president.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:44.720]   Look, I kind of have the Joe Rogan philosophy on this, which is why give it oxygen.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:45.760]   Let's just wait and see.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.840]   There's certainly no need to talk about it before it happens.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:51.120]   You know, we're not even past this election yet.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:55.920]   But, but hey, I want to go back to the Biden popularity, because I think part of the issue
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:01.200]   here is what are the arguments that Biden is making to the country about why people
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.120]   should vote Democratic?
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:08.480]   And he gave another speech on Wednesday night where he basically claimed that if you vote
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:12.480]   for a different party, that that is a threat to democracy.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:17.520]   In other words, the perpetuation of single party rule is what you must do if you care
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.640]   about democracy.
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:22.560]   That is a sales pitch that's not going to appeal to anybody outside of the viewers of
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.280]   MSNBC.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.080]   It's just not.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:27.120]   He's not talking about the issues that really matter to the country.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.960]   You know, what the country wants to know is that he's focused on the economy, he's focused
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:36.560]   on inflation, he's focused on crime, he's focused on the schools and fixing this learning
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.480]   loss that Chamath was just talking about.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.600]   He's not doing those things.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:44.400]   Instead, he's basically saying that the Democrats should be kept in power forever, because there
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.320]   was a riot at the Capitol on January 6.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.800]   And look, that was a stain on the country.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.320]   Okay, it was terrible that that happened.
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:53.760]   But that is not a reason, hold on a second, that is not a reason to keep
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.440]   Democrats in power forever.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:00.640]   And actually, there's a liberal guy, a liberal Democrat named Josh Barrow, who wrote a pretty
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.240]   good blog about this.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:08.000]   And what he said is, "The message is that there's only one party contesting this election
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.920]   that is committed to democracy, the Democrats, and therefore only one real choice available.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:16.480]   If voters reject Democrats' agenda or their record on issues including inflation, crime,
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.040]   and immigration, they have no recourse to the ballot box.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.520]   They simply must vote for Democrats anyway."
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.120]   And that argument is just not flying.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.720]   And actually, he's a Democrat who is pointing this out.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:30.400]   But I don't think that Democrats are getting the message on this.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.280]   But I think they will after this election.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.280]   And they're gonna have to find a new sales pitch to the country.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:39.360]   Well, you know, and he does have a good sales pitch, doesn't he, Chamath, with these major
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.120]   bipartisan wins.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:44.640]   He had the infrastructure deal got done, the technology bill, and the chips.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.160]   You got gas prices going down.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:46.640]   The problem-
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.960]   You got GDP growth, you got job growth.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.880]   The problem is that those things happened, frankly, too early in his presidency.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.720]   And things are getting materially worse.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:55.760]   So I just sent you a link.
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.920]   Can you just throw this up here for a second?
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.040]   You know, Jason, you mentioned this cheaper gas thing.
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:06.160]   But the reality is, if you look at this, we have now depleted our strategic oil reserve
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:06.880]   by almost 50%.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:14.720]   So we are running out of oil that we can introduce into the market at effectively zero cost
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.320]   to bring the price down.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:21.120]   And because we've lost our relationships with folks like Saudi Arabia, there's no way to
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.760]   influence them in order to produce more.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:29.280]   In fact, they're gonna cut supply so that they can control the prices that they have
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:31.760]   which that they can sell into the market.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.360]   And so now what are we left with?
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:37.680]   Well, the only three places where you can have incremental supply of energy, which the
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:42.080]   country still needs, is from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:48.240]   And so, you know, all of these things, Jason, I think, come back and really put Biden in
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.480]   a tough place because as as SAC says, he does have to answer to all of these things because
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.520]   these are his decisions.
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:09:00.320]   Look, I still believe in the Democrats, you know, I am hoping I gave a million bucks to
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:04.800]   the Senate PAC trying to sort of tip the Senate, I really think it's important that we have
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.200]   a split government because I've kind of I gave up on the house.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:11.120]   I think it's clear that the Republicans are going to win, but the Senate is still is still
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:11.840]   up for grabs.
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:18.160]   And the reason is because I think that we need to sort of have stasis so that nothing
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:22.960]   bad happens between now and 2024 because I think the economic conditions on the ground
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.200]   are going to be bad in and of themselves.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:32.240]   And then just the one last thing I'll say is the instructive thing that I think we should
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.760]   look at is what happened in Germany.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:39.040]   Because what happened in Germany is really interesting when the economy turns and inflation
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.120]   is out of control and energy is out of control.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:46.560]   What they basically did was they sidelined the European Central Bank.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:50.960]   They stepped in with their own balance sheet and said, you know what, we're going to nationalize
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:51.440]   assets.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:56.160]   And I know that this sounds crazy to say, but if it can happen in a place like Germany,
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:00.560]   I know most people would say it'll never happen in America, but I'm not so sure.
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:06.320]   And I think that you want to make sure that there's a split government so that these things
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.760]   are never possible.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:12.240]   And so hopefully there's some, you know, common ground in a Democratic Senate and a
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:16.560]   Republican House, and we just kind of get through 24 and see where the chips land.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.480]   And I still think it's going to be Desantis versus Newsom.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:23.280]   Friedberg, any final thoughts here on politics?
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:28.400]   My first observation is that I think it's funny that Chamath and Sachs are funding opposite
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.280]   sides of the electoral cycle.
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.480]   Yeah, why don't you just guys just give the money to me and Friedberg to get a plane
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.120]   each other's money.
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.560]   I could think of other ways for you guys to use that money.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.400]   But David and I may have cancelled each other out.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:40.960]   You're right.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.280]   I mean, so far, Peter Thiel made the better trade.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.440]   He's it looks like the Teal wave in the Senate.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:52.240]   So look, I would say my very broad statement is democracies evolve in a cyclical nature
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.360]   over time, right?
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:57.360]   You often see swings from one political party to the other.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:03.840]   And it's just the nature that once someone's been in office, they form the new establishment.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.840]   And then folks on the next election cycle want to vote against that establishment because
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.880]   there are things that they want that they aren't being given today.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:15.520]   And therefore, the democracy forces a change from what is the current establishment back
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.560]   to the other side.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:20.320]   And generally, political parties seem to kind of adopt whatever the other side is.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.840]   And that's how the cyclical evolution of democracy seems to play out.
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:28.320]   The recent trend that has been more alarming, which I think we can kind of take pause to
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:34.960]   notice is the rise of populism, where populism is this really kind of vehement, diehard opposition
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:40.000]   to elitism and the establishments that everyone feels kept down by and everyone feels taken
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:40.800]   advantage of by.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:47.680]   And the rise of Trump, the rise of Bolsonaro, the rise of Boris Johnson, and I would argue
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:56.000]   even the rise of AOC, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, all similarly speak to the crying
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:05.360]   voice of the democratic populations that they want to see these establishments taken apart.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.960]   They don't feel like they're fair.
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.320]   They don't feel like they're just.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:12.640]   They don't feel like the institutions that oversee us and are meant to service us are
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.280]   servicing us.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.920]   And so there was this big rise.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:19.600]   The problem is like a normal pendulum would swing back and forth between one side and
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.320]   the other.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.480]   With the rise of populism, you get such a strong push of that pendulum, it can knock
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.360]   through a wall.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.280]   And I think we saw that on January 6th.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.360]   And I think it gave a lot of people pause.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:36.560]   We saw the motion of Brexit knocking through a wall, and we saw these kind of very radical
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:41.840]   outcomes and then the cost of those outcomes blow up in our face.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.560]   And as a result, I think we're seeing a bit of a receding of the tides right now away
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:51.280]   from populism during this current electoral cycle, where folks are saying, you know what,
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:55.120]   maybe we just need to have some sort of an establishment so I can feel safe and secure,
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.480]   less than the volatility that I've experienced of late.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:02.960]   Look, I think you look at the economic mess we're in, okay, populist did not cause that,
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:06.000]   okay, populist did not cause $10 trillion of money printing.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.760]   It was modern monetary theory, and the experts, the Fed who did that.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.480]   It wasn't populist, who created the great financial crisis of 2008 that caused the Zerp
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.760]   and we're still living with all the downstream effects of that.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.240]   It was the experts on Wall Street who said they could manage all these derivatives and
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:27.040]   the collateralized mortgage obligations and all that stuff that they lost control over.
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:30.480]   I would argue that the CDC are the experts, yeah.
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:32.560]   The CDC are the experts that caused that.
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:37.840]   And on COVID, it was not populist who caused the horrible handling of that pandemic,
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:38.960]   even though they were blamed for it.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:43.120]   Remember, we were told it was a pandemic of the unvaccinated, then it turns out the vaccine
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.160]   doesn't stop it.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.200]   It was not populist who caused the reaction to the pandemic.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:52.400]   It was the experts, the CDC, and Fauci, and people like that who shut down our economy,
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.920]   who caused the learning loss.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.440]   It was those experts.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:58.960]   So, Freeberg, listen, you may not like this populist wave that we have in the country,
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:04.560]   and I get that, but it's in reaction to something real, which is the failure of this expert class.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:11.360]   And if you want to stop having this populist wave rise up, we need to start having experts
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.440]   in position of power who actually know what they're doing.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.360]   Well, I don't have one way to say that.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.400]   Sorry, J. Cal, hang on one second.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.560]   I don't have any opposition to the populist wave.
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:24.560]   I'm making the observation that the effects of some of the populist movements have started
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.480]   to become too volatile for people to feel like they should continue forward with that
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.360]   electoral path.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:30.720]   That was my observation.
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.200]   Okay, I'm not kind of criticizing the populist movement.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:38.080]   I'm just saying that events like January 6th and the conditions in the UK, for example,
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:42.240]   are making people say, "Wait a second, maybe I need to take pause on the extreme."
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.400]   The bond market basically fired Liz Truss.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.840]   I mean, she's not a populist.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:51.840]   And Bolsonaro in Brazil, he actually just lost, and there was this big narrative that
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:56.400]   somehow he was going to not relinquish power, and he just announced that he will relinquish
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.120]   power.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:02.800]   So, some of the stuff that is about how populists pose this great danger, I think, is threat
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:07.760]   inflation, and that the threat is magnified by elites who want to stay in power.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:12.240]   And the truth of the matter is we need accountability for the people in power, and when they set
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:14.800]   the wrong policies and decisions, they need to be replaced.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.680]   No more no more unaccountability.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:22.640]   Yeah, I mean, I 100% just just my personal belief 100% agree accountability is what's
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:24.960]   lacking most across all of these institutions.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:25.760]   100% agree.
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:30.000]   Accountability, maybe competence, and also transparency and accountability.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.280]   Like, I think that's what the public wants.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:36.480]   I mean, there's no measured by through you want to hear there's no second Hold on.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.360]   There's no way to perfectly react to the pandemic.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.800]   But in your mistakes, owning them and explaining them would be much better than trying to obscure
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.240]   a fight and asking for amnesty.
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:50.720]   Chamath, you're not if you want to hear an incredibly interesting interview.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:58.800]   Because it's very thought provoking of a modern progressive, but with a very different mindset,
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:02.240]   or sorry, you know, maybe you don't want to call him a progressive, but is the
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:07.600]   President of El Salvador, Naib Bukele, and he did this incredible interview with Tucker
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:08.880]   Carlson on Fox News.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:12.560]   I encourage everybody to watch it on both sides of the political spectrum.
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.640]   That man is impressive.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.720]   Did we just get an admission that Chamath watches Tucker?
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.240]   I watched I watched that interview.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.200]   You watched the Tucker?
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.000]   Oh, my Lord.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.040]   Jason's head's exploding.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.640]   You know, because I try not to be a moment's ignoramus.
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:27.520]   It's an entertainer.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.960]   I like to watch things on both sides.
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.400]   But that interview is incredible.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.920]   He is unbelievably impressive.
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:38.720]   And it's a it double clicks into, you know, the skepticism that smart people like him
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:44.080]   the outsider class has with the insider expert class in a nutshell, if you want to see it,
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.560]   I would encourage you to watch this interview because it's incredible.
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.160]   Incredible.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:53.280]   Really, really, Jason, the peasants with pitchforks are rising up against this elite
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:58.080]   class who've put themselves up, they've set themselves up as Lords, they want exclusive
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.760]   control over their blue checks.
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:05.280]   And we're about to overturn this establishment, because it is corrupt.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.480]   And it is incompetent.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:11.280]   It would be great if the people who work for us were confident back on Megan
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.120]   Kelly owned and were transparent.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.200]   You know, I think that's why people are opting out of this is they don't feel
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:22.720]   that there's a level of competence in these institutions, nor ownership and
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:23.520]   transparency.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:29.200]   And it really is frustrating, whether it's education, or it's health, or, you know,
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:32.960]   and any of these topics we've talked about here on the show, let's go to science corner and we
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:33.460]   can wrap.
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:36.560]   What do you got free Burke for us to mock?
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:43.440]   I think we were going to cover the Facebook meta announcement that their AI research team
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:50.880]   had generated the physical structure of 617 million proteins from these metagenomic
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:51.440]   datasets.
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:56.560]   And so remember, alpha fold made this big announcement that they had highly accurate
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:00.240]   predictions of protein structure, the three dimensional shape of proteins.
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.000]   And remember, proteins are kind of the machines of biology that do everything from
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.720]   catalysis to enzymes where they break stuff down.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:10.640]   And they're like, you know, they have all this structure that allows them to do specific
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.680]   physical things.
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:16.320]   And proteins are coded in DNA, every three letters of DNA codes for an amino acid, a
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.640]   string of amino acids makes a protein.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:24.720]   And so you know, we have about a million species, where we've sequenced the entire
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:30.160]   genome of those species, only about 3000 animals, by the way, including humans, half a
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:34.480]   million from bacterial species, and then a bunch of viruses and other stuff, but but
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:37.120]   call it about a million species that we've sequenced.
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:43.040]   And so, you know, earlier this year, Google's alpha fold project published the 3d
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:48.400]   structure of 200 million proteins that they had derived from the whole genome databases
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:51.840]   that existed, where we've gone through and figured out what's the full DNA sequence of
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.800]   all these different species.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:59.520]   Now, when you look at the DNA in the environment around us, you were just to take the DNA
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:06.240]   out, it turns out that we have seen very little of that DNA, the vast majority of DNA that
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:11.360]   you would find in a teaspoon of soil, for example, we've never classified, it's not
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:15.200]   part of a species that we've actually built the whole genome around, we may not even know
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.520]   what species that DNA is from.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.320]   And so when you take a teaspoon of soil, you'll get about 100 billion microorganisms in that
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.120]   soil from about a million unique species.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.640]   But you don't see those species because the way DNA sequencing or shotgun sequencing
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:35.440]   works is DNA is chopped up into little 250 base pair likes little 250 strands, and those
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.760]   250 letters are read at a time.
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:43.600]   And then statistically bioinformatics puts together all of that little DNA segments and
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:47.760]   tries to create long strands of DNA to figure out what the genes are, or what the whole
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:48.880]   genome is.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:52.640]   And so shotgun sequencing gives us kind of a snapshot of the DNA.
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:56.640]   But until we've done the hard work of figuring out the whole genome, we don't know what
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:58.880]   species that DNA comes from.
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:03.440]   So when you take a sample of soil, or you take a sample of human poop, and you sequence
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:08.640]   it, or even a teaspoon of ocean water, and you just sequence the DNA in it, you get all
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:11.680]   of these little segments of DNA that we've never seen before.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:14.880]   And you can string them together statistically, because you get lots and lots of copies of
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:15.440]   them.
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:16.720]   And you can figure out the overlap.
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.480]   And then you can create these genes.
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.440]   And a gene is a segment of DNA that codes for a protein.
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:27.040]   And those genes make up the metagenome, or the combination of all the genes that we find
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.200]   in a piece of the environment.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:34.080]   And that metagenome comes from millions of species that we've never seen before.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:38.800]   So what alpha, what they did at meta is they took all of those genes that we pull out of
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.080]   the soil, or we pull out of the ocean, and they picked a bunch of random samples.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:48.880]   And they then predicted the physical structure of the proteins from just those genes, without
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.200]   knowing what organism they came from.
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:56.400]   And this gives us a whole new universe of proteins that we've never classified before,
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.680]   or never seen before.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.360]   Now, I will just kind of speak a little bit critically about it.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.600]   Number one, they didn't do what alpha fold did.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:08.400]   What alpha fold did is they took 3d structures from typically x ray crystallography, then
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:12.960]   they took the DNA code, and they built machine learn models to figure out the 3d structure
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.160]   from the DNA code.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:20.640]   What these guys did at meta is they took the 3d structures and the code, and they basically
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:24.960]   did a fill in the blank, they found all the metagenome data out of the samples, and a
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.240]   lot of it was missing.
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:32.080]   And they filled in the missing blanks, using kind of common protein structure that existed
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.960]   out there in the wild that we already knew from the alpha fold data.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.720]   And so they kind of did a fill in the blank.
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:40.960]   And as a result, it allowed them to very quickly build these 3d models versus doing the hard
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.040]   and rigorous work that alpha fold had to do.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:47.680]   So they claim that it was 60 times faster, but it's actually an entirely different technique.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:51.520]   And the second thing is that they represent that only about a third of it is high quality,
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.680]   meaning only about a third of the proteins that they've created structure for are really
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:00.640]   useful or that could be kind of applied in terms of this is the real representation.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:02.720]   Now, why is this interesting and important?
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:05.280]   proteins can form the basis of new medicines.
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:10.400]   So you know, we can find proteins in the soil, genomes in the soil and proteins in the soil
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:14.800]   that can kill certain fungal pathogens that can kill bacteria, and those can be turned
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:20.240]   into fungicides, they can be turned into antibiotics, we can find proteins that bind to specific
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:23.760]   things, we can find proteins that fix nitrogen from the atmosphere.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:26.560]   And those proteins can be turned into new types of fertilizer.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:32.160]   So you know, searching through this universe of proteins that exists in the metagenome
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:37.280]   will allow us to find new molecules to do new and interesting things with in the applied
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.080]   engineering world.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:41.920]   And I will say like, this is what would the output of these be is what everybody's going
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:42.480]   to be thinking?
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.400]   And antibiotics fertilizers.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:48.400]   I mean, the idea of the metagenome is rather than start with the species and then take
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.800]   the genes out of it, just go get the genes.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:51.760]   The genes are already there.
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.760]   They're in this, they're in the ocean, they're in the soil.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:57.040]   And there's millions of genes, hundreds of millions, billions of genes that we've never
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:57.760]   seen before.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.520]   Therefore, there's billions of proteins.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.760]   Now we could randomly create proteins.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:05.760]   But the number of proteins that could exist is more than the number of atoms in the universe.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.760]   Because remember, there's 20 amino acids.
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:13.200]   So 20 to the 200th power 20 to the 300th power 20 to the 1000th power, meaning how many different
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.200]   combinations of amino acids can you make?
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.960]   That's more than there are atoms in the universe.
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:22.000]   So the best place to start is what evolution has already given us all the proteins that
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.120]   exist in the environment.
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:25.520]   So let's go find those proteins in the environment.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.680]   And then let's figure out what do we think they can be used for?
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:30.560]   Can they be used in industrial applications in medicine?
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.880]   Can they be doing them in material science?
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.560]   You're saying correct material science.
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:40.160]   And so you know, a lot of drug discovery, mines proteins, it tries to find proteins
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.960]   and figure out what can these proteins be used for.
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:46.960]   And now we have all these new data sets of proteins that are being generated from these
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:47.680]   metagenomes.
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.440]   And so it's amazing.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:53.200]   I mean, you know, look at the world around you look everywhere up and down on the walls
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.720]   on the ground below you.
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:59.120]   There are billions of species of organisms that we've never classified before that are
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:02.960]   making billions of unique proteins that we've never classified before.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:08.160]   And any one of them could unlock an amazing commercial opportunity for industry.
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:10.800]   So and for medicine and for human health, and so on.
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.320]   That's what's really exciting about this ability to kind of mine the metagenome.
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.640]   Silly question for you, or maybe not silly.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:21.680]   We have gotten the precursors to DNA for meteorites.
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:25.120]   If I understand correctly, what do they call them?
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:25.920]   Nucleobases,
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:26.800]   nucleic acids?
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:27.860]   Yeah.
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:29.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:37.920]   I mean, etc, like things that exist in DNA that are precursors, we've never had DNA from
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:42.160]   space, obviously, but we could at some point start to find DNA out there in space.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:45.040]   And this could have an even crazier impact on what we built here.
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:49.920]   Is that the next card to turn over after we know what's here?
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:50.960]   No, I wouldn't say so.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:55.360]   Like, I think, look, if there's DNA that's coming to us from meteorites, call it a couple
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:00.640]   hundred genes, you could pick up a piece of soil and find over a billion genes in that
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:01.760]   piece of soil.
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:02.000]   Right.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.880]   So we have far more to mine here on Earth.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:09.440]   And the low cost of DNA sequencing and shotgun sequencing, coupled with bioinformatics, where
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.160]   we take all that.
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.920]   So just to give you guys a sense, when you take a teaspoon of soil, and you get the DNA
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:18.880]   out and you read the DNA out of it, sequence the DNA, that's potentially 10s of gigabytes
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.840]   of data.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.160]   And then you could do that millions of times over.
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:26.160]   And then you statistically can find genes, and then statistically estimate what they
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:28.720]   physically look like, what those proteins look like.
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.160]   And then you can start to build models around which ones do we want to try and use for drug
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:32.960]   applications?
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:33.840]   Which ones do we want it?
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.600]   So there's so much work to do.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:40.640]   Just in terms of what we have here on Earth, and the tools are getting so cheap and so
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:41.040]   available.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:44.640]   There are labs that are all over the world starting to kind of spring up to do this work.
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:45.360]   It's super exciting.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.040]   Jonathan, any thoughts?
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:50.720]   It's kind of, you know, just to put two ideas together.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:56.400]   I've said before, like the two big investable themes that I'm orienting my organization
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.040]   around is this.
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:00.720]   One is that the marginal cost of energy goes to zero.
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:03.440]   And the second is that the marginal cost of compute goes to zero.
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:08.560]   And the second one is really about shifting compute to more parallelism on GPUs and ASICs
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:09.760]   and FPGAs.
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:12.240]   But that's why all of this stuff is possible.
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:18.080]   The fact that, you know, Meta can do this and Google can do AlphaFold is largely because
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:22.160]   the cost of all of this stuff is, you know, trivial for these kinds of companies.
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.200]   So it's really exciting.
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:29.600]   It's going to move science, in my opinion, out of this in vivo in vitro experimentation
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.040]   model into silica.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:36.240]   And so those who can actually build learning machines will solve some of the most important
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:37.280]   biological problems.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.280]   So I, I'm a real believer in this stuff.
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.640]   I think it's super exciting.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:44.560]   When do you think this stuff actually hits Friedberg, our life?
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.560]   That's always when people talk about these discoveries.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:52.080]   Yeah, a lot of people don't realize it, but so many molecules that are used in agriculture,
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:57.200]   like fungicides to kill fungus in the fields, those are derived from this sort of work.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:02.880]   A lot of antibiotics, a lot of medicines are already derived from mining genomes, finding
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:05.760]   new proteins and seeing what those proteins can do.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:08.800]   Because these proteins didn't evolve in the environment randomly.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.320]   They evolved to do something.
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:15.120]   And in many cases, we can take that thing that they do and then harness it into a product.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.160]   And that's what's so exciting.
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:18.240]   And this this affects everything material science.
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.200]   You know, agriculture, human health.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:24.240]   It's, it's a food, it's really profound.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.760]   Awesome.
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.120]   All right, everybody, there you have it.
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:29.680]   That's another all in podcast in the can.
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:34.000]   Oh, by the way, so many, so many of freeberg stands were afraid, Jay cal that you and I
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.280]   were going to make some joke.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.640]   And we didn't know we didn't.
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:39.920]   And so for all these stands, I just I hope you guys can exhale.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.920]   Take a deep breath, man.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:45.280]   Have some, you know, eggless mayo and enjoy your weekend.
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.280]   Enjoy your week.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:48.000]   Bye bye, everybody.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:48.480]   See you next time.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.120]   Love you besties.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:49.600]   Love you guys.
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:51.840]   You guys, love you besties.

[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:02.840]   And instead, we open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:03.840]   Love you besties.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:05.840]   Queen of Kinwam.
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:13.840]   Besties are gone.

[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.840]   Oh man.
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.840]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless.
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.840]   It's like this sexual tension that we just need to release somehow.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:32.840]   Wet your beef.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.840]   Wet your beef.

[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:37.840]   Besties are gone.
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.840]   I'm going all in.
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:47.840]   I'm going all in.
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.920]   you
