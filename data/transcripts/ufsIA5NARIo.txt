[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.140]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.980]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.160]   Today, my guest is Dr. Peter Attia,
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.460]   his second time on the podcast.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.800]   Dr. Peter Attia is a medical doctor
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.300]   who did his training at Stanford School of Medicine,
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.880]   Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.880]   and the National Institutes of Health.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.400]   He is a world expert in all things related to healthspan,
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.380]   vitality, and longevity.
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.000]   In this episode, we focused on many topics,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.600]   focusing mainly, however,
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.960]   on healthspan and longevity and mental health.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.600]   Healthspan and longevity, of course,
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.120]   relate to how long one lives,
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.120]   and Dr. Attia goes systematically
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.180]   through the seven major causes of death worldwide,
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.040]   beginning with cardiovascular disease
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.040]   and cerebrovascular disease,
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.040]   also cancer, also accident-related deaths,
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.520]   dementia, deaths of despair,
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.220]   and in every case,
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.460]   explains the three or four major levers
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.720]   that one can employ in order to offset,
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.720]   that is to prevent those major causes of death.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.720]   What follows is an incredibly informative
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.580]   and actionable set of tools for anyone,
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.740]   male, female, young, or old.
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.160]   He explains the behavioral, nutritional,
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.280]   supplementation-based and prescription drug-based approaches
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.800]   that one can use in order to extend healthspan and longevity.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.400]   Dr. Attia explains the key tests and markers
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.200]   that we should all pay attention to
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.360]   if our goal is to extend our healthspan
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.240]   and how to do so while maximizing our vitality.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.440]   This is something that not a lot of people think about
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.400]   when they think about healthspan and longevity,
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.520]   but as Dr. Attia illustrates for us,
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.620]   emotional health has everything to do
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.960]   with our physical health and vice versa,
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.080]   and he shares quite openly about his own experiences
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.780]   in pursuing ways to improve emotional health
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.280]   and thereby healthspan, lifespan, and vitality.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.120]   Dr. Attia is quite open about his own experiences,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.160]   exploring different practices to improve emotional health
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.860]   as ways not just to improve healthspan, longevity,
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.360]   and vitality, but of course,
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.780]   also to derive the most meaning and satisfaction from life.
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.000]   Throughout today's discussion,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.880]   we also discussed Dr. Attia's newly released book,
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.400]   which is entitled "Outlive,
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.800]   the Science and Art of Longevity."
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.200]   This is a phenomenal book.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.060]   I've read it cover to cover now three times.
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.400]   I have extensive notes written throughout,
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.340]   and the book of course focuses on longevity and healthspan,
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.860]   and also has an extensive section on emotional health.
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.780]   It gets quite detailed into Dr. Attia's
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.320]   personal experiences with emotional health
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.360]   and tools to improve emotional health
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.440]   that are very actionable for anybody to use.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.500]   I think the best way for me to summarize my feelings
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.120]   about the book would simply be to read
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.400]   the backjacket quote, which I provided.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.480]   So I read quote, "Finally, there is a modern, thorough,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.820]   clear, and actionable manual for how to maximize
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.700]   our immediate and long-term health.
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.500]   Firmly grounded in data and real life conditions,
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.380]   this is the most accurate and comprehensive
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.020]   health guide published to date.
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.200]   Outlive is not just informative, it is important."
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.760]   And indeed, "Outlive" is an important book,
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.580]   as is the discussion that Dr. Attia
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.560]   so graciously provided us in today's episode.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.220]   "Outlive" is released on March 28th, 2023,
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.700]   and is available for pre-order prior to that date.
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.580]   You can find a link to where it's sold
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.260]   in the show note captions.
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.300]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.060]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.400]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.060]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.800]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.980]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.860]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.880]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.560]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.720]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.240]   As I've talked about before on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.880]   there is a critical relationship
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.760]   between sleep and body temperature.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.200]   That is, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep,
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.660]   your body temperature needs to drop
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.320]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.920]   And in order to wake up in the morning and feel alert,
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.640]   your body temperature needs to increase
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.840]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.160]   The problem with most people's sleeping environment
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.120]   is that even if you make the room cool,
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.860]   the actual environment that you sleep on,
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.300]   that is your mattress and underneath your covers,
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.780]   is hard to regulate in terms of temperature.
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.620]   With Eight Sleep, regulating the temperature
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.000]   of that sleeping environment becomes incredibly easy.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.460]   In fact, you can change the temperature
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.160]   of that environment across the night,
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.880]   making it a little bit cool at the beginning of the night,
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.180]   even cooler still a few hours into your sleep,
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.540]   which really helps getting into very deep sleep,
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.960]   and then warming it as you approach morning
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.340]   so that you wake up feeling most alert.
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.460]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.900]   for over a year now,
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.240]   and it has completely transformed my sleep.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.500]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.540]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.460]   to save up to $150 off their pod three cover.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.280]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.560]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.380]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.680]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.540]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.860]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.780]   That means plenty of salt, magnesium,
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.020]   and potassium, and no sugar.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.280]   The electrolytes, salt, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.500]   are critical for the function of all cells,
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.520]   in particular neurons or nerve cells.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.900]   And of course, proper hydration is critical
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.140]   for mental functioning and physical performance.
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.020]   To ensure that I stay hydrated,
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.120]   I consume one packet of Element
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.540]   in approximately 20 to 30 ounces of water every morning
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.820]   when I first wake up.
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.300]   And I will also consume one Element packet
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.220]   in about the same amount of water when I exercise
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.660]   or when I'm doing any kind of mental work,
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.340]   preparing for a podcast, writing grants,
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.020]   working on papers, and so forth.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.940]   I find that allows me to maintain my focus
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.700]   and physical performance at levels
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.700]   that I just simply can't otherwise.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.740]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.620]   that's lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.100]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.280]   Again, that's Drink Element, lmnt.com/huberman.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.500]   Today's episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.860]   HVMN Ketone IQ is a supplement that increases blood ketones.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.820]   I want to be clear
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.020]   that I am not following a ketogenic diet.
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.620]   Most people fall into this category.
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.540]   They are not following a ketogenic diet.
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.140]   They are omnivores and they do eat carbohydrates.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.040]   So their standard fuel source for the brain and body
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.420]   is not ketones.
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.920]   However, I found that by taking ketone IQ,
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.300]   which we know increases blood ketones,
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.300]   I can achieve much better focus for longer periods of time
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.580]   for any kind of cognitive work
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.020]   and much greater energy levels for exercise,
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.780]   especially if I'm going into that exercise fasted
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.620]   and find myself a little bit hungry
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.260]   when I start that exercise.
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.320]   And this is no surprise.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.220]   We know that ketones are the brain's
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.180]   and body's preferred fuel source,
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.780]   even if you're not following a ketogenic diet.
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.260]   So in other words, I and many other people
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.480]   are now starting to leverage endogenous ketones
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.380]   as a fuel source for the brain and body,
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.440]   and yet we are not following a ketogenic diet.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.220]   And of course, if you are following a ketogenic diet,
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.440]   ketone IQ will further allow you
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.740]   to increase your blood ketones
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.900]   as a source of brain and body fuel.
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.420]   If you'd like to try ketone IQ,
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.980]   you can go to hvmn.com/huberman to save 20% off your order.
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.180]   Again, that's hvmn.com/huberman.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.920]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.160]   with Momentous Supplements.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.480]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.680]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.320]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.880]   livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.260]   And I should just mention that the library
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.440]   of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.560]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.940]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Peter Attia.
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.680]   Dr. Attia, Peter, welcome back.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.520]   - Thanks, man.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.840]   Good to be back and sounding better this time.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.000]   - Looking forward to talking about a number
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.380]   of important topics with you that you cover in your book.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.520]   Maybe we could start off by trying to set the frame
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.320]   for what people should be thinking about
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.800]   in terms of vitality and especially longevity.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.840]   - So I mean, I think you have to be mindful
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.600]   of how you define these terms.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.940]   And I'm not gonna suggest that the way I define them
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.900]   is the only way or necessarily the best way.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.740]   But I think from a clinical perspective,
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.740]   it's the way that makes the most sense to me,
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.640]   having thought about this for the better part of a decade.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.960]   So it involves some bifurcation
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.060]   between lifespan and healthspan.
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.340]   Lifespan is very easy for people to understand.
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.720]   It is binary, you are alive or you are not alive.
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:35.580]   And clearly part of longevity is about how long you live.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.480]   Now I think for a lot of people,
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.820]   that tends to be where the discussion ends.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.360]   That tends to be the focus of it, right?
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.480]   It's sort of like longevity somehow implies living
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.720]   for 100 years, 120 years, something to that extent.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.360]   We talk a lot about maximum lifespan.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.320]   Even in laboratory experiments with mice,
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.000]   that's sort of one of the metrics that's discussed
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.500]   is what's maximal lifespan of the animals.
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.740]   But there's an equally, if not slightly,
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.860]   I think potentially more important part of longevity,
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.500]   which is healthspan.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.140]   And healthspan is squishier
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.120]   and I think it requires some definition.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.340]   Now the medical definition of healthspan
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.340]   is the period of time by which you are free
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.960]   from disability and disease.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:29.420]   I find that to be a not particularly helpful definition
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.060]   because by that definition,
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.280]   you and I have the same healthspan today
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.140]   that we did 30 years ago.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.540]   But I know you pretty well, you know me pretty well.
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.060]   30 years ago, we were twice the men we are now
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.980]   based on what we believe our healthspan is, right?
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.340]   In terms of our cognitive function,
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.560]   our physical performance and things like that.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.060]   So I've clearly experienced the deterioration
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.840]   of my physical function as I'm sure you have
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.620]   going back to when you were a teenager,
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.080]   late teenager, early 20s.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.080]   And I think that needs to be captured somehow in healthspan.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.300]   So the way I think of healthspan really
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.400]   is along these three dimensions,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.320]   physical, cognitive, and emotional.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.960]   Again, not necessarily suggesting
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.520]   that that's the only way to do it,
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.160]   but I do think that clinically it makes the most sense.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.240]   And so therefore, anything that really becomes
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.400]   a question of longevity has to address all of these issues.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.140]   Lifespan, physical health beyond that
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.580]   of just straight up disability and disease,
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.720]   cognitive health independent of and separate
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.740]   from pathology such as dementia,
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.300]   and emotional health which of course
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.120]   is by far the most complicated of all of these
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.940]   because we have no biomarkers for it.
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.780]   We have no, you know, it's not like you can get a scan
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.100]   on somebody and determine the state of this.
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.920]   But nevertheless, it's important, right?
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.900]   And it dramatically factors into quality of life.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.660]   - So with all of that in mind,
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.660]   what are the major exit points
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.080]   for people along the lifespan route?
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.240]   Let's just start with the binary one, dead or alive, right?
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.440]   I think most everyone who's healthy
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.720]   would like to be alive rather than dead.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.320]   So what are the typical ways that people exit
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.320]   from alive to dead and how can people stay
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.080]   on the free way of life, so to speak?
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.640]   - So this is again a great analysis.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.080]   We internally in our practice call this
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.560]   the death bar analysis.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.880]   And it's a surprisingly trivial analysis
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.560]   that I'm just surprised the death bars
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.880]   aren't plastered front and center on every doctor's office.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.360]   So if you simply just look at actuarial data
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.560]   which are readily available through the CDC
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.280]   and do a little bit of data, you know,
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.520]   manipulation and analysis, you can pretty quickly realize
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.840]   what the horsemen of death are.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.760]   'Cause there's largely speaking kind of four horsemen of death.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.280]   The first and most consequential in terms of the numbers
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.640]   is the diseases of atherosclerosis.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.600]   So that's cardiovascular disease
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.060]   being the lion's share of that,
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.480]   but also cerebrovascular disease.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.420]   So anything that has to do with atherosclerosis
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.140]   rises to the top.
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.260]   Now that's true in the United States,
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.480]   but it's even more true outside of the United States.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.140]   It's even more true globally.
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.460]   So in other words, when you look at the relative difference
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.520]   between the number one cause of death in the US
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.480]   and number two, which is cancer,
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.560]   the gap is actually smaller in the US than globally.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.720]   Globally, it's enormous.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.560]   We're talking about 18 to 19 million people a year
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.680]   that are dying of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.980]   in the world.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.720]   Whereas number two is cancer at about 11 million.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.840]   - How does the number change
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.040]   when you include cerebrovascular disease?
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.280]   - Yeah, it adds a bit to it.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.880]   Cerebrovascular disease, largely speaking,
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.080]   you can die sort of through embolic events,
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.580]   which are the majority of them.
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.220]   - Can you explain for people what embolic events are?
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.600]   - Yeah, so taking a step back,
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.280]   what does the brain need more than anything?
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.420]   It needs blood flow.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.900]   Anything that interrupts blood flow to the brain
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.560]   that results in ischemia is devastating.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.760]   And it's devastating in a more readily apparent fashion
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.360]   than virtually any other organ.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.680]   So one way that that can happen is if a clot
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.400]   or disruption of blood flow occurs
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.820]   through obstruction of blood flow.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.160]   So that can occur through a clot.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.400]   So for example, if a person has atrial fibrillation
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.680]   and a blood clot gets festering in the right atrium
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.900]   and they happen to have a hole
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.640]   between the atria of their hearts,
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.140]   called a patent foramen ovale,
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.020]   and a clot goes from right to left,
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:42.000]   it can make its way up into the arterial circulation
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.500]   and happen that way where you include blood flow.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.120]   The much more common way it occurs
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.620]   is the same way it occurs in the heart,
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.180]   which is you have plaque buildup
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.320]   and that plaque becomes unstable, that plaque ruptures.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.460]   And the rupture of that plaque results
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.980]   in an immediate attempt by the body to fix the problem.
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.480]   But in doing so, it walls off the artery,
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.340]   meaning the blood flow distal to that point
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:09.660]   so that now blood is acutely being robbed of that.
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.460]   However, there are other ways that people can
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.380]   have this problem.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.820]   And so you have the whole hemorrhagic side of this.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.260]   So you can have blood vessels that,
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.540]   small blood vessels in the brain that will rupture
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.420]   as a result of high blood pressure, for example.
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:27.260]   So hypertension factors into both sides of this equation,
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.100]   both in the heart and in the brain.
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.260]   The majority of these are embolic, however.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.660]   So don't quote me on this exactly,
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.720]   but call it four or five to one strokes
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.760]   result from an embolic phenomenon
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.840]   as opposed to a hemorrhagic phenomenon,
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.320]   a bleeding phenomenon.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.340]   - I don't want to take us too far off on a tangent,
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:50.060]   but as long as we're here talking about bleeds versus clots,
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.020]   what are some of the major risks for bleeds?
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.420]   I mean, I know some people out there
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.780]   have genetic predispositions for being bleeders,
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.460]   as they're sometimes called, or clotters.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.780]   So things like factor V Leiden mutations,
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.980]   which can be exacerbated in women, for instance,
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.820]   by taking certain oral contraceptives.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.200]   I mean, and there's a huge list.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.620]   If people are interested in them, they can look up,
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.500]   what are the factors controlling bleeding
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.040]   and predispose people to be in a clotter?
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.340]   But for the typical person out there who feels healthy,
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.640]   but might do well to know whether or not
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.620]   they are predisposed to be a bleeder or a clotter,
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.140]   what sorts of things rise to the top of that list
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.960]   and that people might want to check into?
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.720]   - Well, I mean, there might be sort of
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.700]   two different things going on in that question,
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.100]   but I think if your question is,
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.820]   when we look at the subset of people
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.780]   who are at highest risk for hemorrhagic strokes,
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.940]   the far more germane question
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.500]   is not underlying coagulopathy.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.060]   The far more germane question
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.780]   really comes down to blood pressure.
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.700]   Blood pressure would be the first, second,
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.600]   and third driver of that.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.380]   So hypertension is, hands down,
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.180]   the leading driver of hemorrhagic stroke phenomenon.
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.140]   - Okay, so I'll just briefly interrupt and ask,
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.820]   since sometimes your recommendations
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.900]   deviate from the standards that one would find online
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.860]   or in the typical doctor's office,
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.940]   at what point do you get concerned?
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.460]   - Well, I actually find myself quite in line
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.560]   with the most recent available data on blood pressure.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.140]   And this has been, obviously it's a topic
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.140]   that's of high concern to any doctor
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.340]   who's taken care of patients,
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.640]   who even pays a fraction of attention
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.700]   to the available literature,
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.260]   which is that basically
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.540]   with each subsequent blood pressure trial,
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.060]   the data are becoming clearer and clearer
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.560]   that the more aggressively you manage blood pressure
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.860]   to be within the 120 over 80 range, the better.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.420]   So there's a recent study that even looked at going
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.300]   from what used to be considered acceptable,
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.380]   which was 130 to 135 over 80 to 85.
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.900]   We used to basically say
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.940]   that's kind of the first level of hypertension.
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.020]   And we would say, well,
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.020]   do you really need to be better than that?
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.180]   And the answer turns out to be, yes, you do.
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.900]   If you want to reduce heart attacks and strokes,
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.620]   it's better to be 120 over 80 than 135 over 85.
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.940]   Now, this is a whole other rabbit hole
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.180]   that we don't need to go down,
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.240]   but it's a total obsession of mine,
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.780]   which is how do you measure a person's blood pressure?
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.840]   I think this is potentially, I'd have to give it thought,
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.440]   but honestly, I could say top three
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:27.020]   under-diagnosed fixable problems in the United States today,
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.200]   and probably globally.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.580]   In other words, there are too many people walking around
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.420]   with high blood pressure who don't know it.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.580]   And I think part of the problem is it's something
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.860]   that is mostly done in the doctor's office,
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.920]   and the readings that you get in the doctor's office
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.320]   can be often misleading.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.620]   You've heard of this phenomenon of white coat hypertension.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.820]   So you go to the doctor,
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:50.120]   your blood pressure is virtually never measured correctly
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.180]   in the doctor's office.
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.540]   - That cuff they put on and that little squeeze bulb,
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.820]   that's not accurate. - Yeah, if you look
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.720]   at the rigor with which you need
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.060]   to measure a person's blood pressure,
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.580]   the right way to do it is the person has to be sitting
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:05.200]   like this for five minutes doing nothing.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.100]   - Okay folks, so when you go to the doctor's now,
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.420]   you don't let them take your blood pressure
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.700]   until you've been sitting for five minutes,
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.420]   and that doesn't include in the waiting room,
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.260]   because if you walk from the waiting room--
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.860]   - Right, because then you get up and walk over, right.
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.260]   - Okay, so make them stand there.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.540]   - Right, so you want to be sitting there like this.
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.820]   A manual cuff is better than an automated cuff,
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.860]   but not enough people use manual blood pressure.
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.780]   So a manual blood pressure means they put a cuff on you
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.700]   and they actually put a stethoscope on the brachial artery
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.240]   and they're using the human ear to listen,
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.500]   which, believe it or not, you would think a machine
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.820]   is better, but it's not.
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.980]   The machine can be misled by different sounds.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.980]   Now, I don't want to suggest that automated cuffs
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.020]   are useless, they're not, but when an automated cuff
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.260]   gives you an answer that is potentially suspect,
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.600]   always back it up with a manual.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.500]   I'm pretty relentless about checking my blood pressure,
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.740]   and so I'll do side-to-side manual versus automated
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.380]   every day, and there's easily a 10 to 15 point difference
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.700]   between them.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.860]   - Maybe this is a silly question,
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.540]   but can people check their own blood pressure?
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.380]   - Meaning manually?
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.140]   - Yeah, just could I get a cuff and a bulb
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.900]   and learn how to do it?
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:12.740]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:13.940]   I mean, I can do it, but honestly,
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.260]   I usually have my wife do it, she's a nurse,
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.300]   but it's not rocket science to check blood pressure.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.420]   I guarantee you there's a great video on YouTube
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.380]   that explains the physiology of it,
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.860]   if you're willing to splurge on a good enough stethoscope,
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.540]   and the cuff I have is really easy to use.
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.340]   Once you put it on, it's in a single thing,
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.740]   I'm squeezing the bulb and looking at the pressure gauge
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.700]   while I've got the stethoscope on my artery.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.940]   - I mean, given the importance of blood pressure
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.980]   and this arterial sclerosis being at the top of the list
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:48.200]   of risks for dying, it seems to me
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.180]   it might be worth the expense.
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.260]   What's a typical range of costs for quality?
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.220]   - I don't, it's not inordinate.
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.780]   I feel like my blood pressure cuff is 40 bucks,
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.140]   and the stethoscope is a couple hundred bucks,
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.580]   if you're getting a good one.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.060]   And a good automated cuff,
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.900]   I have no affiliation with any of these companies.
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.140]   I use two automated cuffs, one's called Withings,
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.620]   and the other one's made by a company called Omron, O-M-R-O-N.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.940]   And they're both decent, but again, they tend to run high,
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.860]   and I have yet to find a credible explanation
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.260]   from cardiologists as to why.
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.640]   Everybody acknowledges that the manual one,
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.460]   when done correctly, is the answer,
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.860]   but I've heard wonky answers about why automated ones
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.080]   are sometimes incorrect.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.900]   And again, it's just made me realize,
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.840]   we're not checking blood pressure often enough on people.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.240]   We're overly relying on blood pressures
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.040]   in the doctor's office, which are not being done correctly.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.580]   So we basically have our patients do this relentlessly.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.260]   - So how often, let's say someone buys this,
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.100]   'cause I think for $240, I mean,
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.820]   I realize that's prohibitive for some people,
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.900]   but given the cost of some of the other things
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.140]   that are discussed on this and many other podcasts--
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.240]   - First of all, I would just let people start
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.060]   with an automated cuff to begin with,
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.540]   and just start with there.
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.900]   We generally have people do it for two weeks.
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.920]   You know, we give our patients a little spreadsheet
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.180]   that automatically calculates averages and stuff like that,
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.900]   tells them what to record and where.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.420]   And we just say, look, for two weeks,
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.780]   we want to see two recordings a day.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:17.780]   And, you know, do a morning and an afternoon/PM recording
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.920]   twice a day for two weeks, and let us see those numbers,
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.400]   and we'll scrutinize them further.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.100]   And if those numbers come in fine,
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.600]   let's revisit in a year.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.320]   - Will a day ever come when a watch
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.560]   or a wristband can do this really well?
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.080]   - So I hope so, and I'm investigating it.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:43.080]   I'm actually gonna be trying one out in a couple of weeks
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.100]   with a company that I tried two years ago,
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.440]   two years ago when I tried it, I was not impressed,
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.980]   so I kind of punted on it.
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.800]   The company, which I guess I'll not share the name
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.320]   of the company just yet, but they claim
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.340]   that it's significantly better,
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.800]   so I'm gonna put it to the test again.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.560]   And it's basically a continuous monitor.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.440]   So it's a wrist device that about every 15 minutes
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.480]   throughout the course of the day
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.040]   will check your blood pressure.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:16.120]   To me, this would be, honestly, probably more important,
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.420]   you know how much emphasis I place on CGM
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.940]   as a great thing to be able to test.
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:20.780]   - Continuous glucose monitor.
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.640]   - Right, I would argue this would be more important.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.560]   When the day comes that we can continuously
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.060]   assess people's blood pressure,
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:30.460]   it would be an integral part of a person's health checkup
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.400]   once a year is do two weeks
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.120]   of continuous blood pressure monitoring.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.020]   Right now, to do that, which I've done as well,
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.720]   is so cumbersome that it borders on absurd.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.200]   You actually have to wear a blood pressure cuff
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.900]   that is attached to a clumsy device
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.280]   that goes through the whole insufflation exercise
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.920]   every 15 minutes, including while you're sleeping.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.720]   You know, it provides some insight,
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.400]   but it's so disruptive that it's not what we really want.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.560]   The dream would be like a patch that you could put,
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.680]   I don't know, over your chest
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.120]   that can somehow impute changes in blood flow
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.640]   or something like that and regulate, but we'll see.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.760]   Between optical sensors and things like that,
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.600]   I hope that we're getting closer to having something.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.720]   - So I don't want a stroke.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.620]   I don't want to bleed in the brain.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.460]   I don't want to clot.
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.120]   As long as we're at this number one on the list,
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.380]   arthculosclerosis being the number one killer,
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.280]   what are the major ways to prevent it?
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.560]   - Yeah, so there's three big ones that stand out,
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.020]   you know, top and center.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.340]   And then there's kind of a fourth one
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.160]   that I think is the foundational piece.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.700]   So the three big ones we've talked about,
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.160]   one, blood pressure.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.000]   So if your blood pressure is 120 over 80 or better,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.340]   that's important.
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.900]   The second is not smoking.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.000]   So it turns out that smoking and blood pressure
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.800]   are both devastating for arteries,
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.040]   but for different reasons, right?
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.840]   So smoking is devastating from a chemical perspective.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:04.520]   So it's completely irritating to the endothelium.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.680]   So the endothelium, as you know, is the single cell lining
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.200]   that is the innermost part of the arterial
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.380]   and arterial wall.
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.060]   So this is a pretty special organ.
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:20.400]   Again, it's a bit naive, but understandable
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.180]   that people just think of arteries as tubes.
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.680]   They're much more complicated than that.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.380]   They have many layers to them.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.800]   But this particular layer is unusually important.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.280]   It has an outsized importance,
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.800]   because it is the one that's in contact
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.420]   with the luminal side, right,
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.780]   where the blood is flowing in the tube.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.100]   And anything that injures that has significant consequences.
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:46.440]   So smoking is irritating to that in a chemical way,
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.640]   and blood pressure is irritating to that
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.240]   in a mechanical way.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.700]   So those two things, basically, you just wanna,
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.060]   that's the low-hanging fruit in my world, right?
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.340]   You just don't wanna have those things
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.360]   causing irritation to the endothelium,
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.740]   because that renders you now susceptible
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:05.820]   to the third factor, which is ApoB-bearing lipoproteins.
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.540]   - I wanna talk about ApoB in depth,
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.140]   but as long as don't smoke
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.880]   is the second recommendation on the list,
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.660]   can we better define smoking and what's being smoked?
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:23.020]   So assume nicotine, what about cannabis?
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.420]   And what about vaping of nicotine and cannabis?
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.740]   Because vaping has become so much more common.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.680]   - Yeah, it's a great question,
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.940]   and it's sadly something we don't have a great answer for.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.700]   So I can certainly tell you that there's no reason
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.140]   to believe that smoking cannabis
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:44.700]   is somehow better than smoking cigarettes.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.420]   But the dose seems to be significantly lower.
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.740]   In other words, let's consider a person
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.780]   who smokes a pack a day for 20 years.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.260]   We call that a 20-pack year smoker.
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.380]   Someone who smokes two packs a day for 15 years
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.120]   is a 30-pack year smoker.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.860]   That's a person who's dramatically increased
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.100]   their risk of many cancers, including lung cancer,
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.000]   and also their risk of cardiovascular
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.660]   and cerebrovascular disease.
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:16.100]   Again, I'm not a THC guy, so I can't necessarily speak
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.620]   for the habits of people that are smoking marijuana.
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.700]   I can't imagine they're smoking that much.
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.540]   - Probably not.
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:26.540]   - Yeah, so while on a joint to cigarette basis,
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.520]   they're probably equivalent in terms of harm,
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.340]   I don't know, let's say a person smokes a joint a day,
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.700]   that would be like smoking a cigarette a day.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.600]   That's a 20th of a pack.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.980]   Again, I don't wanna say that there's no downside to that,
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.580]   but it's probably significantly less.
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.440]   So I don't think the risk fully tracks.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.260]   I think the same is probably true for vaping.
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.760]   And I wanna be clear, I don't think vaping's a good idea.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.360]   The last time I looked at the data on this,
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:02.880]   it was surprisingly sparse, but to me,
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.720]   the only advantage I could see to vaping
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.660]   was if it was the only way a person would stop smoking.
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.480]   So there was, I sort of looked at it as,
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.680]   it was definitely the lesser of two evils,
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.280]   but by far the better scenario
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.640]   was not to do any of these things.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.780]   If nicotine is what you're after,
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.460]   there are better ways to get nicotine, for example,
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.800]   through lozenges and gum and things like that.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.540]   So you shouldn't be turning to those things to do it.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.460]   But if it was like, if gum is here and cigarettes are here,
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.540]   vaping was probably here, but boy, I don't know.
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.740]   - For those listening, Peter spaced his hands
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.320]   far apart for gum and smoking and put vaping
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:48.160]   about a third of the way from gum toward smoking.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.140]   In other words, vaping isn't good for you,
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.700]   but it's not as bad as smoking.
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.980]   - That would be my, I mean, do you have a,
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.300]   you've probably looked into this as well.
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.440]   What are your views on this? - Yeah, we did an episode
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.280]   about nicotine.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.300]   I did an episode on cannabis and, you know,
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.700]   the discussion around cannabis gets a little contentious
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.940]   for reasons that aren't important.
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.900]   It's kind of funny, the moment someone starts
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.000]   to confront cannabis as a potential health harm,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.920]   people say it's not as nearly as bad as alcohol,
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.560]   which is a crazy argument, right?
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.140]   Getting hit by a bus isn't nearly as bad
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.160]   as getting hit by a motorcycle in most cases,
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.000]   but sometimes, you know, so that's just kind of silly.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.820]   And clearly cannabis has medical applications, clearly.
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.740]   And then it becomes an issue of the ratio of THC to CBD,
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.660]   pure CBD forms actually being quite effective
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.600]   for the treatment of certain forms of epilepsy,
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.200]   so-called Charlotte's Web, that's actually what it's called.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:41.060]   Very high THC containing cannabis clearly predisposes,
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.780]   especially young males, to later onset psychosis.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.240]   Those data are starting to become clear,
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.420]   clear enough to me anyway,
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.580]   that people ought to be aware of them at least,
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.020]   and maybe make decisions on the basis of those.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.380]   When it comes to the smoking versus vaping,
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.740]   it's just very, very apparent
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.220]   that the chemical constituents of the vape
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:07.900]   and what people are inhaling are terrible for people
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.820]   and are loaded with carcinogens and a bunch of other stuff,
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.740]   many of which cross the blood-brain barrier.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.580]   So that's what worries me the most.
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:16.620]   Obviously I'm not a clinician,
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.400]   but anytime I hear about small molecules, you know,
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.860]   these small inorganic molecules
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.440]   getting across the blood-brain barrier
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.780]   and then being maintained in neurons for many, many years,
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.820]   I worry because the experiment is ongoing
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.100]   mostly in young people.
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.360]   So anyway, without going too far down that track,
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.740]   I think if people can avoid smoking and vaping, they should.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.800]   And as you mentioned, there are other delivery devices
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:40.180]   for nicotine and cannabis, tinctures and patches and gums
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:43.080]   and things that, edibles that,
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.780]   if people choose to use those substances, they can offset.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.260]   - I think sometimes people would benefit to imagine
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.860]   what the surface area of the lung is, right?
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.560]   If you took the alveolar air sacs of the lungs
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.420]   and spread them out, you would easily cover a tennis court.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.260]   - Remarkable.
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.460]   - So just think about anytime you inhale something,
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:11.040]   you are exposing, your body is so adept at absorbing it.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.980]   I mean, we have this unbelievable system for gas exchange
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.700]   that was designed for gas exchange.
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.180]   And anytime you're putting something else in that wake,
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.040]   you're doing a really good job of getting it into your body.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.760]   So be mindful of what that is.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.020]   And that, look, that applies to pollution too.
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.140]   I mean, the PM2.5 data is pretty good.
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.700]   I think once you, so particulates that are less
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.420]   than 2.5 microns are getting straight into the body,
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:41.220]   which is like a great argument for avoiding air pollution.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.680]   I mean, I always find it funny,
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.900]   not to get off on this tangent, but to me,
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:50.820]   the most compelling arguments around cleaner energy
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.940]   have nothing to do with greenhouse gases.
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:54.740]   They have to do with air pollution.
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.340]   I promise you more people are dying
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.040]   from the particulate matters in air
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   that result from burning coal than are ever going to die
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.900]   from the CO2 emissions that result from that.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.900]   And I would argue that's gonna be two orders of magnitude.
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.300]   It's not even in the same zip code.
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.140]   - That makes sense.
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:16.300]   - During the fires, which seemed to follow me
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.740]   because when I was in Northern California,
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.640]   there were a bunch of fires and we were constantly looking.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.700]   I mean, wake up in the morning,
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.540]   everything was covered with ash.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.980]   My dog was having trouble breathing.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.040]   I was having trouble breathing.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.740]   Everyone was suffering.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.100]   But there are websites that one can go.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.500]   You can just look at air pollution.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.580]   And we tend to only do this during fires.
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.460]   And then, you know, when I'm in Southern California,
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.420]   there tend to be fires here.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.560]   So, you know, it's correlation, not causation,
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.500]   but for sure, I didn't set those fires, folks.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.440]   But it's clear that it disrupts your breathing
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.900]   for a very long period of time.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.300]   But it's the long tail of that
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.560]   that we're really talking about here.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.100]   The very small particulate that we know firefighters,
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.100]   for instance, and certain industrial workers
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.320]   can end up with that stuff embedded in their brain tissue
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.860]   for extremely long periods.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.520]   That's just not good.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.760]   You make a really interesting point
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.700]   about the call for cleaner energy.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.700]   Can we run that one up to Washington
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.820]   or settle some of the debates about climate change
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.620]   just by getting straight to help bypass all the garbage
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.800]   that's being spewed back and forth
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.700]   and basically get to the issue at hand, right?
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.620]   - Yeah, just make it better for people to not die
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.640]   from the direct consequence.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.140]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:29.060]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.540]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.900]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.780]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.480]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.700]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.300]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.360]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.360]   once or usually twice a day
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.260]   is that it gets to be the probiotics
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.960]   that I need for gut health.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.080]   Our gut is very important.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.600]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.360]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.760]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.400]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.260]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.100]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.660]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.560]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.440]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.900]   nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great.
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.360]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.740]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.720]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.040]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.320]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.620]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:32.020]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.720]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.080]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.940]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:44.640]   So trying to avoid, such a difficult word to say,
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.840]   especially for a neuroscientist, arterial sclerosis.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:48.720]   Did I get it right?
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.040]   - Well, it's athero, which is easier, 'cause yeah.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.180]   - Atherosclerosis.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.020]   Oh, there.
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.980]   I've been making life more complicated for myself.
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:55.980]   Typical of me.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:00.980]   Okay, so blood pressure, keeping it 120 over 80 or better.
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:04.140]   Don't smoke.
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.600]   Let's just throw in don't vape.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.440]   - Sure.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.260]   - I'm gonna just plant my flag on it.
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.100]   Just don't vape.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.760]   There are other ways to get those things in your system
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.040]   if you really wanna get nicotine
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.200]   or cannabis into your system.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.720]   ApoB.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.760]   What's the story with ApoB?
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.440]   - Okay, so to explain this,
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:23.440]   you have to tolerate a little bit of chemistry.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.580]   So everybody's heard of cholesterol,
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:29.600]   and I certainly devote quite a bit of time in the book
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.480]   to explaining this, because it is so important.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.280]   And it's definitely one of those areas
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:39.000]   where I initially received a lot of pushback from the editor,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.160]   and there was a thought that hey,
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.800]   this is a bit more technical than it needs to be.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.600]   But I think that sometimes you do need to resort
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.680]   to longer dissertations to dispel mythology.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.320]   So cholesterol is a lipid.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:59.000]   It is a molecule that the body synthesizes.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.640]   It is a molecule that is essential for life.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:05.920]   So if you cannot synthesize cholesterol, you can't live.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.120]   You'll die in utero.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.520]   So there are rare genetic conditions
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.880]   that prevent the successful synthesis of cholesterol.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.100]   Embryos that have those mutations do not survive.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.460]   Okay, so why do we need this stuff?
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:24.000]   So we need this stuff primarily for two reasons.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.880]   First, it makes up a very important
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.700]   structural component of cell membranes.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:33.140]   So as you know, a cell is a sphere.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.840]   We look at them and think they're circles,
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.920]   but they're spheres, and they're fluid, right?
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.100]   They aren't just like little perfect big bowling balls
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.700]   or balloons.
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:47.520]   They actually morph and shape and move in these paths.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.360]   And this is what allows cells to be next to each other
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.500]   and all sorts of things.
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.080]   They also have channels across all of them,
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:57.060]   and those channels are held in place by,
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.920]   among other things, cholesterol and phospholipids.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.440]   The second thing that makes cholesterol so important,
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.640]   it is the precursor to some of the most important hormones
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.720]   in our body.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.640]   So our sex hormones, testosterone, estrogen, progesterone,
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.620]   in addition to glucocorticoids.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.140]   If you look at them, it's really funny.
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.040]   People, if you're looking at, if you Google,
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.600]   like give me the structure of these things,
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.600]   you're kind of like, wow, they're all basically the same.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.880]   They all look really similar,
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.000]   and they're all pretty much just templates of cholesterol.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.600]   So understandably, when it's something that's that important,
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.160]   the body would leave nothing to chance.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.280]   We make all of our own cholesterol.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.060]   The cholesterol that you eat in food, largely irrelevant.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.460]   It's esterified cholesterol,
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.680]   so it means it has an ester side chain.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.700]   It's too bulky to absorb in the gut.
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:42.720]   So most cholesterol that you eat in food
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.280]   just goes out your GI tract.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.800]   Okay, so we have this super important molecule
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.260]   that every cell in the body makes,
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.000]   but there's a bit of a problem.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.840]   There's actually two problems.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.640]   The first problem is not every cell can make
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.680]   as much as it needs all the time.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.200]   So you have this demand problem.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:03.020]   So for example, if you're sick,
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.560]   you're gonna need to make far more glucocorticoids.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.120]   Your body's response is going to be
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.160]   to ramp up cortisol production to mobilize fuel
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.000]   and do a whole bunch of other things,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.080]   and certain cells, like the adrenal glands,
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.360]   are gonna be called on to rise
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.320]   to a higher level of performance,
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.160]   and they're not gonna be able to make enough cortisol.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.960]   So they're going to have to borrow or take cholesterol
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.080]   from other cells in the body.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.240]   In fact, one of the things we used to notice in the ICU,
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:33.640]   I never knew why it was happening, I now know,
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.560]   is the few times I would accidentally order
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.960]   the wrong set of labs on a patient in the ICU
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.600]   and also order like a lipid test or something,
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.520]   you would always notice their cholesterol levels
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.200]   were dropping, you know, serum cholesterol levels.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.840]   And I now realize why, because they were basically
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.120]   just funneling cholesterol to the adrenals
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.940]   to make more of the cortisol that they needed
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.080]   to combat whatever they were in the ICU for,
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.400]   which is usually the most severe form of, you know,
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.680]   stress the body is under.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.680]   So you have to be able to transport this stuff.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.960]   And then the second problem is, as you know,
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.840]   cholesterol, being a lipid, is not water soluble.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.400]   So the most dominant highway in the body
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.720]   is the circulatory system.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.720]   We can use the lymphatic system and things like that,
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.480]   but for the most part, we use our circulatory system
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.360]   as the highway to move stuff around.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.280]   And the highway is made up of water.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.440]   Plasma, which is the liquid component of your blood,
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.960]   is water, and therefore things that are water soluble
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.960]   move easily, so glucose, sodium, electrolytes,
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.420]   all of those things are dissolvable in water,
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.040]   and therefore they don't need a carrier.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.240]   You just dissolve them in the water and they can go.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.740]   So that's why your liver can make glucose
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:48.540]   that your brain can easily get,
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:50.100]   and there doesn't need to be a carrier
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.460]   or an intermediary or anything like that.
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.720]   But unfortunately, with cholesterol being a lipid,
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.860]   we can't do that.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.160]   Just as water and oil don't mix,
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.740]   cholesterol and plasma don't mix.
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.340]   So the body had to come up with a trick.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.660]   And the trick was designing a vehicle
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.600]   that was water soluble on the outside
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.280]   and fat soluble on the inside,
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:16.060]   that you could bury the cholesterol inside,
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.260]   along with triglycerides.
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.920]   And on the outside, it was covered in protein,
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.920]   which is water soluble,
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.660]   and that's the thing that moves around.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.440]   And that thing is called a lipoprotein.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.440]   And as its name suggests, it's part lipid, part protein.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.040]   Lipid on the inside, protein on the outside.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:36.040]   And those lipoproteins come largely
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.380]   in two different families.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:44.560]   So one family comes from a lineage called ApoB.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.780]   So the ApoB family,
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:51.300]   which is short for Apolipoprotein B100,
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.140]   is a family that is derived from the liver.
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.780]   And each of those lipoproteins
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:01.780]   has one and only one Apolipoprotein B100 on it.
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.420]   We shorten it and just call it ApoB,
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.660]   'cause we don't really worry about Apolipoprotein B48,
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.900]   which is attached to chylomicrons
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.400]   that are responsible for fat absorption in the gut.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.900]   They're very short-lived.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.620]   They don't really factor into atherosclerosis.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.820]   So we're gonna just, for the purists out there,
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.620]   there's an ApoB48, we're not gonna talk about it.
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:23.860]   So when I say ApoB, what I'm talking about
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.820]   is a protein that wraps around
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.820]   a subset of these lipoproteins.
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.980]   There's another family of lipoproteins called ApoA,
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.440]   or Apolipoprotein A.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.380]   This is a much more complicated family.
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.260]   And I'm not gonna talk about it here,
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:42.480]   'cause we would take an hour to just explain
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.240]   how the Apolipoprotein A family works,
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:48.360]   but I'll give the punchline is,
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.360]   there are many Apolipoprotein As,
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.200]   there's variable numbers of ApoAs on those proteins,
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.660]   and they are all part of a family
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.220]   called high-density lipoproteins.
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.120]   Back to the ApoB guys,
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.980]   they are of the low-density lipoprotein lineage.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.480]   So you've heard the term LDL and HDL.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.420]   What is it referring to?
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:09.020]   It's basically referring to the relative concentrations
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.600]   of protein and lipids in the lipoproteins,
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.620]   and not surprisingly, based on their names,
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:17.820]   the HDLs are higher density, more protein, less lipid.
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.660]   The LDLs, low-density lipoproteins,
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.280]   and VLDLs, very low-density lipoproteins,
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.500]   and IDLs, intermediate-density lipoproteins,
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:31.020]   are all lower density, which means more lipid to protein.
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:31.940]   There are different sizes,
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.140]   there's a whole bunch of other things going on.
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.600]   Most important fact in all of this
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:40.380]   is that the ApoBs are atherogenic.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.660]   So what we're about to talk about next
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:47.260]   is perpetuated by lipoproteins that have an ApoB on them.
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:49.160]   So everything in the story right now
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.920]   is just about how do you get cholesterol around the body.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:59.780]   - And these proteins that have lipid in the middle.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:03.420]   So let's just take ApoB for example.
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:07.900]   Many, many billions of them floating around in our body,
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.820]   even in the healthiest of people.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:15.820]   And they're being shuttled to tissues that need them,
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:20.740]   like the adrenals, muscle, heart, et cetera.
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:24.740]   What sets the demand for these things?
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:29.100]   So for instance, could somebody have relatively high LDL,
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:35.120]   maybe even higher than sort of high end of chart,
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.120]   or even above high end ApoB,
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.660]   but there's some sort of demand, metabolic demand,
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.140]   or they're weight training a lot,
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.480]   or they're running marathons,
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.480]   and so they need a lot of LDL.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:52.480]   The reason I ask this is because it's so easy
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.800]   for the uninformed person,
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.560]   which I include myself in that group,
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:01.560]   to just think here, oh, LDL bad, cholesterol bad, ApoB bad,
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:06.440]   when in fact you very graciously spelled out the fact
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:10.460]   that these things actually perform a functional role
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.680]   in the healthy body.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.220]   So before we get into why they are or can be bad,
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.580]   why would you want a low density lipoprotein?
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:19.380]   What is that doing for somebody?
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.260]   And is there any circumstance
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.100]   where the way people are exercising,
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.380]   or thinking, or not sleeping, or sleeping too much,
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.680]   it's that a higher level actually reflects
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:32.500]   a healthy metabolic need?
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.800]   - We don't have any evidence of that to date.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:39.400]   All of the functions that I described
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.680]   can be done by the HDL.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.500]   So the high density lipoproteins,
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.440]   the ApoAs, can do all of it.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.600]   - So ApoB and low density lipoproteins are just,
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:57.320]   they're just the necessary, the waste.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.900]   - No, we don't understand why we have them, Andrew.
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.960]   This is the part that's really interesting to me.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.680]   Most species do not even have ApoB.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.600]   And as a result of that,
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:12.600]   most species are chemically incapable of atherosclerosis.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:16.920]   - So if someone could zero out their ApoB and their LDL,
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:20.080]   we assume they would function just fine.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.660]   - We know they would because we have certain people
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.540]   who walk around with genetic mutations
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.540]   that render them that way.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:27.380]   - Wow.
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.000]   - Furthermore, we also know that,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.440]   there's a bit of a myth out there that cholesterol,
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.440]   the cholesterol you measure in your blood is essential
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.800]   for brain health, for example.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:37.920]   That's an understandable thing, right?
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.680]   You can speak to this very eloquently,
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.640]   the role of cholesterol in the brain.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.540]   - Yeah, I wrote down when I was a postdoc at Stanford,
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.400]   so I always point out, I was born at Stanford,
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.840]   trained at Stanford, where he said I'd probably die
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.400]   at Stanford, hopefully a long time from now.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.240]   You'll tell me how long from now.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.480]   - Well, we're gonna do the Charlie Munger thing
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.720]   and make sure that you never go back to Stanford
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.280]   so that you can't die there.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.720]   - There, exactly.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.200]   We cured already.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:06.320]   When I was a postdoc, I worked with a guy named Ben Baras,
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:10.440]   who I know you know, probably as a different person then,
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.060]   for reasons that people can look up Ben's name.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.200]   Anyway, incredible scientist,
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.400]   but there was someone in his lab that discovered
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.760]   that cholesterol is a critical component
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.560]   of the synaptogenesis process,
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.360]   the formation of connections between neurons
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.480]   in the developing brain.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.720]   And then that went on to lead to the discovery
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.560]   of things like thrombospondins being important
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.080]   for synaptogenesis, et cetera.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.560]   But cholesterol sits central
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.560]   in the brain development mechanisms.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.580]   You want cholesterol around for brain development.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.440]   In fact, I think very low-fat diets
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.520]   and very low-cholesterol diets during early development
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.960]   can really impair brain development, as I understand.
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.640]   - Yeah, it's not entirely clear why,
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:50.980]   but here's what we know.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:55.860]   When you're born, your serum cholesterol levels are very low.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:00.860]   So children, infants and children, have very low levels
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:01.920]   of cholesterol.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.900]   They would have, and I should explain one thing
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:05.740]   that's important.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:07.240]   - Well, they're not myelinated yet, right?
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:10.160]   I mean, sorry to interrupt, but myelin, of course,
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.860]   the sheathing around neuronal axons,
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:16.320]   which accelerates the propagation of nerve signals
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:19.660]   and which is deficient in things like multiple sclerosis,
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:22.260]   is essentially fat made up of phospholipids
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:25.380]   and requires cholesterol for synthesis.
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.420]   But young children are not very well myelinated.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.420]   I mean, the spinal cord is myelinated.
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.420]   Spinal tracts are myelinated.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.860]   - So this is what's interesting, right?
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.980]   We would all agree that cholesterol is more important
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:39.180]   to infants and children than to anybody else, right?
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.400]   It would be the most important substrate
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.920]   for CNS development, and yet infants and children
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:49.140]   have virtually unmeasurable levels of cholesterol.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.620]   It really starts to take off in your teenage years, right?
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:54.620]   So cholesterol basically, serum cholesterol levels rise
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.760]   basically monotonically throughout life.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:00.720]   Women get a big bump at menopause,
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.220]   so it really goes up for them.
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:07.240]   But what's interesting is how is it,
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:10.500]   how do we reconcile the fact that infants and children
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:13.320]   have really low levels of serum cholesterol
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:18.320]   yet clearly undergo CNS maturation without any problems?
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:21.380]   And it basically comes down to the following.
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:25.920]   What you measure in the serum is but a fraction
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.260]   of the total body pool of cholesterol.
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:31.920]   So we get a little bit of the light under the,
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.560]   what's the street lamp under the--
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.400]   - The drunk under a--
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.100]   - The drunk under the street lamp problem.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.400]   Just because we're looking there,
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.980]   we tend to think that that's what we're seeing.
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:44.980]   But if you took the entire circulatory pool of cholesterol,
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:48.500]   it's about 10% of your total body cholesterol.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:50.180]   It's a tiny fraction of it.
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:53.160]   So it's what we measure 'cause that's all we have access to,
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.500]   but it really represents virtually none of it.
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:58.620]   I do wanna say something 'cause you mentioned LDL.
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.420]   I wanna tie this back to the reader, right,
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:01.620]   or the listener rather.
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:08.640]   ApoB refers to the lipoprotein, the singular lipoprotein
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.860]   wrapped around an LDL particle.
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:14.680]   So if you happen to be lucky enough
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:18.860]   that your doctor measures an ApoB level, it's a blood test.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.900]   It says ApoB X number of milligrams per deciliter.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.980]   That's measuring the concentration of that protein.
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:29.340]   It is a direct measurement of the concentration
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:33.080]   of LDL and VLDL particles.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.940]   When you have a blood test that says LDL,
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:37.460]   it usually doesn't say LDL.
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:40.460]   It usually says LDL-C or LDL cholesterol
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:43.220]   because LDL is not a laboratory measurement.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:46.040]   LDL cholesterol is a laboratory measurement.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.740]   And it's just taking the total number of LDL particles,
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.180]   breaking them apart,
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.740]   and measuring how much cholesterol is in them.
[00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:58.320]   So LDL-C measures the total concentration of cholesterol
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.120]   in the LDLs.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:03.860]   ApoB measures the number of them.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:07.280]   And they're different, but one of them is far superior
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.300]   at predicting risk in its ApoB.
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:13.920]   The number of particles is much more predictive of risk
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.520]   than the amount of cholesterol contained within them.
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.080]   - Fascinating.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:22.160]   First time I've understood HEL-LDL
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.880]   and these lipoproteins in a way that makes sense.
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.140]   So thank you.
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.780]   I'm sure others feel the same way.
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:33.780]   What ApoB level is your red flag cutoff, right?
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:37.900]   I actually had my ApoB measured recently
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.540]   and I'm definitely above the high end.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:42.600]   - We'll be discussing this over dinner on Saturday night.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.760]   And just to tie this back,
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.960]   I hope that's a steak dinner and that should be fine
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.720]   given the fact that dietary cholesterol
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.840]   has no direct link to ApoB and LDL.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.500]   - That's true, but dietary saturated fat does.
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:55.340]   - Okay, so I'll-
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:56.560]   - Which is not to say we're not going to have a steak.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.880]   We will, but-
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.780]   - Not necessarily one of the fattier cuts.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:03.040]   Although probably will be for me.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:08.440]   So what's the high end that you, high end flag?
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.520]   At what point do you start saying,
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.720]   "Ah, we need to do something."
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.560]   And then we'll talk about what people can do.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.600]   - Yeah, so this is a complicated question
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.720]   because it depends on so many factors.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.960]   The first factor it depends on is what is your objective?
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.080]   And I do pose this question directly to a patient, right?
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.600]   So I say, look, we've got this disease
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.000]   that's the number one cause of death.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.460]   Now you can die with it or you can die from it.
[00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:35.560]   Those are your choices.
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:38.720]   Statistically speaking, more people will die from it
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:39.920]   than anything else.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:40.880]   But if you live long enough,
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.220]   we will all die with it to some extent.
[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:48.320]   So if you're me and I come from a family history,
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.040]   as you know, I write about this in the book,
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.920]   where basically every man in my family except one
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.160]   has died of atherosclerosis
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.940]   and they have all done so very prematurely.
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:51:00.520]   My dad's lost brothers in their 40s and 50s.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:04.800]   By some miracle, my dad is still alive at 86,
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.720]   but I think that's in large part
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:11.320]   because he at least had the good sense to listen to doctors
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:13.320]   and take medication to lower his cholesterol
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.320]   and blood pressure.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:21.320]   If your objective is to not die from heart disease
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.040]   and only to die with it,
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.440]   then you want ApoB as low as possible.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:32.440]   Now, how low you go depends on when you start,
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.960]   because one way to think about this
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.680]   is it's an area under the curve problem.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:42.460]   The longer you wait to start doing something about this,
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:45.660]   the more aggressively you need to do something about it.
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:50.320]   I think a better way to think about this though
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:53.400]   is to go back to what we talked about with smoking.
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:58.400]   So would you agree that smoking is causally related
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.380]   to lung cancer?
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:01.220]   - Yes.
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:02.760]   - So just to be clear, Andrew,
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.960]   you do not think that it's just an association
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.700]   that smokers get more lung cancer?
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.560]   - No, I do not.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.720]   - In other words, you believe that smoking
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.800]   causes lung cancer then?
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:15.880]   - Yes.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:18.900]   I mean, there are a number of mechanistic steps in between.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:22.640]   I mean, if somebody was really wanting to drill
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.840]   into the logic, they could say,
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:25.080]   okay, it's not actually the smoking,
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:30.080]   it's some disruption of the endothelial cell lining that--
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:32.880]   - Smoking triggers that, it triggers that.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:33.720]   - I assume so.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.680]   - And I agree with you, by the way.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:35.840]   I think the data are very clear.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:37.680]   - I'm very relieved to hear that.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.160]   - But I'm going someplace very important here
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:44.120]   because if there's one topic that doesn't get enough
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.960]   attention in medicine, it's causality.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:51.460]   And causality is an obsession of mine.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:55.000]   Like most of the day on some level,
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.060]   I sit around thinking about causality.
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:03.060]   And I think the hardest part about studying medicine
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:06.460]   with respect to human beings is how difficult it is
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:10.080]   to infer causality for most things that we do.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:16.180]   So if you believe that smoking is causally related
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:22.660]   to lung cancer, then smoking cessation
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:26.160]   reduces the probability of lung cancer.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.020]   That is a logical equivalency.
[00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:31.060]   There can be no debate about that.
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:35.040]   What if I said to you, Andrew, this is going to be
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.280]   our new philosophy around smoking cessation.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:42.980]   You're gonna anoint you the czar of smoking cessation.
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:47.060]   So if people pick up smoking, no problem.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:48.640]   We're gonna let them smoke.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:53.260]   But we're going to assess their risk for lung cancer
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:57.180]   using a model that predicts when their 10-year risk
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:59.860]   of lung cancer gets above a certain level,
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:02.180]   we're gonna recommend that they stop smoking.
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:04.140]   So we're gonna look at their age, their sex,
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:07.660]   their family history, some biomarkers that might help us.
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:10.380]   We're gonna even do scans of their lungs.
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:13.720]   And once we think they cross a threshold
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.620]   where their risk of lung cancer is high enough,
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:19.420]   let's just say it's 25%, boom, you make them stop.
[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:21.340]   You tell them it's time to stop.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:25.460]   Is that a logical approach to treating smoking
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:28.340]   and lung cancer or would it be better to say,
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:32.860]   given that we know cigarettes are causally related to this,
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:35.980]   how about you never start smoking and the minute you do,
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:37.460]   we pull the cigarette out of your mouth
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:39.660]   and explain to you that you're doing something
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.660]   that is causally related.
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:43.580]   Of course it would be the latter, not the former.
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:47.740]   It would be idiotic to suggest that we endorse smoking
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:49.780]   until you cross a certain threshold.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:54.420]   Well, this now becomes the germane question.
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:57.160]   There is no ambiguity that APOB
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:00.340]   is causally related to atherosclerosis.
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:03.460]   How can I tell you that?
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.160]   I can tell you that looking at
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.060]   all of the clinical trial literature,
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.680]   all of the epidemiologic literature,
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.480]   and perhaps even most importantly,
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.860]   the Mendelian randomizations.
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.940]   All of these things tell us, because by the way--
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:19.620]   - Mendelian randomizations meaning genetic mutants,
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.960]   humans out there that make very little APOB
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.320]   or excessive APOB. - And very much, exactly.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.160]   So we have a whole gradient.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.980]   - So you can say if you make very little,
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:29.880]   you aren't gonna die as quickly in your life
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:30.980]   as if you make too much.
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:31.820]   - That's right.
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:33.880]   So Mendelian randomization is such an elegant tool
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:37.900]   where you basically let genes do the randomization
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:42.020]   and as you said, there is a gradation of LDL concentration
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:45.640]   or APOB concentration that occurs from insanely low
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:49.420]   to insanely high and this is a wildly polygenic,
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:51.580]   polymorphic set of conditions
[00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:55.260]   and we can look at the outcomes of those people
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.540]   based on the random sorting of those genes
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:59.260]   and there's no ambiguity.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.660]   LDL is causally related.
[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:03.340]   LDL cholesterol or APOB,
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:05.900]   causally related to atherosclerosis.
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:09.380]   Well, if that's true,
[00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:12.280]   and I haven't seen a credible argument that it's not,
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:15.420]   there are people who argue that it's not, by the way,
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.740]   but they just don't have credibility in their arguments,
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:20.380]   then you have to say
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:23.300]   that what we're doing in medicine today is very backwards
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:26.540]   because what we're doing in medicine today is the following.
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:29.780]   We're saying, I'm coming at this in a long way,
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:31.300]   but your question is so important
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:32.700]   that I wanna answer it this way.
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.080]   We're answering your question today as follows.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:40.080]   We're saying, Andrew, let's do a 10-year risk calculation
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:42.900]   of your risk of MACE.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.820]   MACE stands for Major Adverse Cardiac Event.
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:48.780]   It is the metric we use in medicine.
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.340]   So a major adverse cardiac event is a heart attack,
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:55.300]   stroke, or death basically resulting from these things.
[00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:59.260]   And we have calculators that are pretty good
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:02.860]   at predicting your 10-year event risk.
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:05.040]   They'll look at your cholesterol levels,
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:07.540]   your blood pressure, they'll ask if you smoke,
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.780]   they'll ask some family history questions,
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:11.780]   and they'll spit out a number.
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:14.180]   Now, we should do yours after the fact.
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:19.260]   And I don't know, if we did it for a person
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.280]   who's is, you know, you're in your mid-40s,
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:26.060]   like it would probably spit out less than 5% risk
[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:28.860]   for a major adverse cardiac event in the next 10 years.
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:33.860]   In fact, the models don't even work if age is below 40.
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:37.420]   So the first time I went to do one of these tests
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.340]   when I was in my mid-30s, I couldn't do it.
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:42.780]   Like, the algorithm breaks.
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:44.460]   That's sort of like, you know, just doesn't work.
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:48.040]   So the implication there is if you're,
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:52.940]   if your MACE risk is less than 5%,
[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:56.340]   the thinking is you do not need to treat LDL or ApoB.
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:58:00.340]   I argue that that makes absolutely no sense.
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:04.560]   It's just as idiotic as the analogy I used around smoking.
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:08.460]   If a risk is causal and it is modifiable,
[00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:10.660]   it should be modified regardless
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:12.900]   of the risk tail in duration.
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:17.460]   So then the question becomes to what level?
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:19.100]   And again, the earlier you start,
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:20.820]   the less aggressive you need to be,
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:22.900]   the less damage that's there already.
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:26.140]   So for example, we do CT angiograms on our patients.
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:29.260]   If the CT angiogram shows no evidence of calcification,
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:32.780]   no evidence of soft plaque, that means grossly,
[00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:34.700]   their coronary arteries are still normal.
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:36.260]   Histologically, they're probably not
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:38.980]   because nobody probably makes it to our age
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:41.520]   with histologically perfect coronary arteries.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:46.300]   You know, we might be satisfied with a person's ApoB
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:48.420]   being at the fifth percentile of the population,
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:51.260]   which would be about 60 milligrams per deciliter.
[00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:55.020]   But if we have any other factors,
[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:57.460]   meaning we're starting later in life,
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:02.140]   or a person already has gross evidence of disease,
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:06.140]   calcification, soft plaque, family history is significant,
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:08.740]   any other risk factors are present,
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:12.900]   I mean, we'll treat ApoB to 30 to 40 milligrams per deciliter,
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:15.020]   which is, you know, probably the first percentile.
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:18.200]   - And if somebody's sitting up in the, say, low 130s,
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:21.940]   what kind of flag does that raise for you?
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:24.820]   And I realize it's highly contextual, age, et cetera.
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:26.380]   - No, no, it's a huge red flag.
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:29.300]   Again, just because something is causal
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:31.300]   doesn't mean you're guaranteed to get it.
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:33.060]   There are smokers who don't get lung cancer.
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:35.220]   So, you know, there's gonna be somebody listening to this
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:39.100]   who says, my grandmother's 95 years old,
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:41.620]   she's is, her cholesterol is sky high
[00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:44.300]   and she's alive and well, and I will say, absolutely,
[00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:46.220]   there are a lot of people walking around that way,
[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:48.580]   just as there are a lot of smokers walking around
[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:50.460]   who don't get lung cancer.
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:55.480]   You can't, you can't impute these things
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:57.260]   on an individual basis.
[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.860]   You basically have to ask the question,
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:04.060]   how do I make the best judgment about an individual
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:07.620]   from heterogeneous population data
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.800]   and based on what are causal
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.300]   and non-causal inferences around risk?
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:17.300]   So, you know, to me, if a person has very high ApoB
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:21.460]   and they do not want to be treated for it,
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.020]   then the best we would do is say,
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.220]   let's at least establish that there are no other
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:28.000]   risk factors present and let's at least
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.780]   do the most investigation we can around the existing damage.
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:36.780]   And if that person has a perfect CT angiogram,
[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:38.780]   I'm gonna push less hard than if they have
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.460]   a devastating angiogram.
[01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:42.460]   And by the way, devastating in my book
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:45.060]   is just any amount of calcification or soft plaque.
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.820]   Anything that shows up grossly that you can see
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:51.620]   on a CT scan means that you've got a decade plus
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.940]   of really bad histology building up to it.
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:58.060]   - This issue of causality, I think now,
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:01.780]   becomes very clear as to why that is so crucial
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:04.520]   and I really appreciate the way you spelled that out.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:09.520]   So let's say somebody's ApoB is, you know, 80, 100,
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:14.380]   let's say 130, for example.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:17.880]   What sorts of things can they do to reduce that number?
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.940]   Is this always going to be prescription medication?
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.140]   And if so, what are the more common forms
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:24.380]   of prescription medication that work best?
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.700]   What are their side effect profiles and so on?
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:31.460]   - So, yeah, usually once you want to start getting down
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.260]   into the 30 to 60 range,
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.240]   you're gonna require pharmacotherapy.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:38.840]   But, you know, usually we want to see how far we can get
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.680]   with nutrition.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.040]   So fixing insulin resistance in an insulin resistant person
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.060]   will bring this down, right?
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.940]   So one of the hallmarks of insulin resistance
[01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:50.020]   is elevated triglycerides.
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:51.660]   They haven't, we haven't talked about triglycerides,
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:54.220]   but they warrant some attention
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.780]   because I mentioned it earlier,
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:59.860]   but one of the other things that the lipoproteins carry
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:01.040]   is triglycerides.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.500]   So they're, you're carrying fat and cholesterol.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:09.640]   And if you recall, ApoB represents the number of particles.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.940]   So the purpose of them is to be carrying around
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.100]   mostly cholesterol,
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.760]   but if you have a high amount of triglyceride,
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.640]   you're basically using up cargo space on the ships.
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.540]   And so you need more ships.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:25.080]   So if a person has elevated triglycerides,
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.300]   and I consider anything over a hundred to be elevated,
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.820]   even though most laboratory tests would consider normal
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:33.580]   to be up to 150 milligrams per deciliter,
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:38.260]   we would want to fix their insulin resistance,
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:40.640]   bring the TRIGs way down.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:44.280]   I would want to see TRIGs no more than two times
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.340]   the HDL cholesterol.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:48.520]   So if their HDL cholesterol is, you know,
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:51.080]   60 milligrams per deciliter,
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.920]   I consider 120 to be through the roof high.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:58.880]   And ideally we want TRIGs at or below HDL cholesterol.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:02:59.960]   - TRIGs being triglycerides.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:00.800]   - That's right.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.240]   - And does that mean lowering dietary fat?
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.840]   - No, actually it's most easily accomplished
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.340]   through carbohydrate restriction.
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:09.780]   Yeah, carbohydrate.
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.960]   Triglycerides in some ways are kind of an integral
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.320]   of carbohydrate consumption.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:17.340]   Any energy restriction will get it for you,
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:22.000]   but it's most sensitive to restriction of,
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.520]   even under eucaloric conditions,
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.460]   carbohydrate restriction will lower triglycerides.
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.880]   So again, energy restriction would be kind of
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.000]   first order of business,
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.660]   but within that carbohydrate restriction
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.700]   will probably get you there quicker.
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.840]   So, you know, you sort of take the low-hanging fruit
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.680]   off the table.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.600]   - And where does exercise play a role?
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.520]   - Minimal role.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.040]   - For improving insulin sensitivity?
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:45.880]   - No, no, no, I'm sorry.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.920]   For improving lipids in general, yeah.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.880]   - But it can improve insulin sensitivity?
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:51.720]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.600]   - Especially combinations of resistance training
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.360]   and cardiovascular exercise, correct?
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.180]   - Yeah.
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:58.920]   So once it comes down to pharmacotherapy,
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.640]   you basically have several classes of drugs.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.200]   So the most obvious and the one that most people
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.280]   are aware of are called statins.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.280]   So statins work both directly and indirectly on the problem.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.700]   So directly they work by targeting an enzyme
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:17.840]   very high in the synthetic pathway of cholesterol production.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.500]   Enzyme is called HMG-CoA reductase,
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.160]   and I think it's the second committed step.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.060]   I could be wrong on that.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.640]   I don't think it's the first committed step,
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:29.520]   but that enzyme gets targeted kind of ubiquitously
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.820]   throughout the body.
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:35.400]   And in response to that, the liver senses a reduction
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.720]   in the body's pool of cholesterol.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.640]   And the liver really tries to regulate this.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.840]   So the liver in response to that
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:46.100]   increases its expression of LDL receptors.
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:49.480]   So the liver itself has LDL receptors on its surface.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:52.840]   And as the body's pool of cholesterol goes down,
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.820]   the liver senses this reduction and says,
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:56.900]   "I wanna bring more cholesterol in."
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:00.260]   More LDL receptors go up and more ApoB particles
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.840]   are coming out of circulation.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.420]   So that's really the dominant way that they work.
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.200]   And in fact, that's kind of a dominant way
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.580]   that all of these drugs work.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:10.940]   So another class of drug is called ezetimibe.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:13.660]   It works by blocking,
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.160]   we could get as technical as you want on this.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.660]   It's called the Nieman-Pix C1-Lyke-1 transporter
[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:18.920]   in the enterocyte.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:21.140]   I like to explain this.
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:23.380]   I borrowed this explanation from Tom Dayspring.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:28.380]   But the enterocyte is obviously the luminal gut-side cell
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:32.620]   that is responsible for absorption of cholesterol.
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:33.460]   Remember I said earlier,
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:36.020]   most of the cholesterol you eat, you don't absorb.
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:37.540]   The reason you can't absorb it
[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:40.260]   is an esterified cholesterol molecule
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:44.220]   cannot come in the Nieman-Pix C1-Lyke-1 transporter.
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:46.300]   It's physically too large.
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.540]   But the cholesterol that you synthesize,
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:51.260]   which once it makes its way back to the liver,
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:54.460]   gets secreted in bile down the intestine,
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:58.480]   that is unesterified and readily fits into that transporter.
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.060]   So I kind of describe that guy
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.140]   as the ticket taker at the bar.
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:05.700]   He lets everybody in as long as they fit through the door.
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:08.180]   There's a checkpoint inside the bar that basically says,
[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:09.660]   do we have too much cholesterol?
[01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:10.880]   If so, spit it out.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.120]   And there's another door that acts more like the bouncer,
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.840]   and he's called the ATP binding cassette G5-G8,
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.300]   and he spits excess cholesterol out.
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.780]   And if that system's working fine,
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:22.940]   everything is great, but in a lot of people,
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.660]   that ATP binding cassette doesn't work very well,
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:27.220]   and it can't properly regulate
[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:29.180]   the total body pool of cholesterol.
[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:30.820]   So there's a drug called ezetimibe
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:33.380]   that simply blocks the ticket taker.
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:36.820]   - Are there side effects to statins and ezetimibe?
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:39.740]   - Ezetimibe has virtually no side effects.
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:40.620]   You can think of it as a drug
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.660]   that's acting outside the body, right?
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:47.020]   It's sort of acting on a turnstile door in your gut.
[01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:52.420]   I have seen one patient get sort of loose stools from it
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:55.940]   that became enough of an issue that we discontinued it.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:59.140]   I would say that when ezetimibe is combined with a statin,
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:04.140]   which is very commonly done, it's not unheard of.
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:07.980]   I can't give you a number, but it could be as high as 10%
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:10.900]   that you see an elevation in transaminases,
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:12.640]   which are enzymes that are made by the liver
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.300]   in response to some irritation.
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:17.320]   So this is where I think it's unclear
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.040]   what the clinical significance of that is.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.060]   We tend to abort the strategy
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:24.820]   in the presence of elevated transaminases.
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:28.080]   Even though the literature says you don't need to,
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.860]   our view is we have other options.
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:33.780]   Why would we tolerate any inflammation if you don't need to?
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:35.980]   Statins do have side effects.
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:39.980]   So 5% of people genuinely and legitimately
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:43.480]   get a muscle soreness that can be debilitating.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.140]   It could feel like kind of the worst workout
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:46.500]   you've ever had that, you know,
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.980]   like the day after you've,
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:50.620]   like imagine you hadn't lifted weights in six months
[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:52.800]   and then you, you know, came over
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.980]   and I made you do the most brutal workout of your life.
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:55.820]   You know how you would feel the next day?
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:56.820]   - That happens every time I come over to,
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:58.480]   well, I work out often,
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.140]   but every time I come over to your house,
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:02.940]   you put me through the most brutal workout
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:04.380]   I've ever been through.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.420]   I think you and Cam Haines are the two people
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.000]   who've managed to put me through workouts
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.180]   that kept me sore for at least two weeks after each visit.
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:16.420]   - So that soreness, imagine you would have that persisting
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:19.020]   5% of people get that response from a statin.
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.500]   And obviously that's just non, you know,
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:23.680]   it's a non, it's a non, it's a non do.
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.140]   There's a narrower subset of people
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:29.540]   that do, do get brain fog
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.380]   and do experience brain fog from statins.
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:33.900]   And we don't really understand the why there.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:35.840]   We have some theories as to why, you know,
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:40.260]   maybe they're, maybe they're getting too much of a reduction
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:42.940]   in central cholesterol synthesis.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.520]   - Again, it's a subjective finding,
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.440]   but given that we have so many tools in the toolkit,
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.240]   like we don't have to tolerate side effects
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.240]   with these drugs anymore.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.960]   There was a day when, you know,
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.200]   you had somebody who just had a heart attack
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.060]   and they're basically looking down the barrel
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:00.000]   of being on a statin for the rest of their life.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.720]   And there were like two of them and they, you know,
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.660]   had tons of side effects and it didn't matter.
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:08.000]   Today, while there were probably nine statins out there,
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.600]   there were really only four that we even use.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.980]   And at least two of them have such a low side effect profile.
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:15.360]   They're not as potent, but they have a,
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:18.360]   I mean, potent's a bit of the, potent's the wrong word.
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:22.580]   They don't have the same effect, but they're very potent
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:23.580]   because you're, at least one of them,
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:25.880]   you're taken at such a low dose
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.900]   that we've got lots of statin options.
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:32.360]   The third side effect of statins, which again, not common,
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:35.780]   but can't be ignored is insulin resistance.
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:38.680]   So it really, and this is one of the,
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.120]   I think one of the benefits of at least having
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.180]   periodic CGM tracking is we'll see this.
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.860]   We had a patient who happened to be wearing CGM in general,
[01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:51.100]   and then we started him on 10 milligrams of resuvastatin,
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.980]   which is probably the workhorse statin right now.
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:55.960]   That's a generic term for Crestor.
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:00.160]   And he pings us like a couple weeks later and he's like,
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.300]   man, my glucose is like 10 points up consistently
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.900]   from where it has normally been.
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.620]   Kind of hummed and hawed.
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:08.300]   We troubleshooted a few things.
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:12.560]   After two months we're like, let's just stop the Crestor
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:15.520]   and see if that fixes it, and it immediately fixed it.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:18.460]   So we reintroduced the Crestor and it happened again.
[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:20.760]   So there was no doubt in my mind that,
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.640]   or low doubt in my mind that Crestor
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.680]   was responsible for that.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.640]   And again, you could say, well,
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.340]   maybe that's not that clinically significant,
[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:28.960]   but I would argue, why bother?
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.300]   I have other choices.
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:32.280]   So those are your two big ones.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.120]   The next one that is really the big one
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.800]   are PCSK9 inhibitors.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:40.800]   So you know, gosh, coming up about 20 years ago maybe,
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:45.380]   a woman named Helen Hobbs made a discovery
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:48.520]   of a group of people that had a disease
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.060]   called familial hypercholesterolemia.
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:52.840]   So FH, or familial hypercholesterolemia,
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:56.500]   is a very genetic heterogeneous condition.
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.420]   Going back to that Mendelian randomization study,
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.960]   these are the people on the far end
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:04.280]   that show us how high lipid levels cause atherosclerosis.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.460]   So these people have very high cholesterol levels,
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:09.200]   typically north of 300 milligrams per deciliter.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.540]   Their LDL cholesterol alone is, by definition,
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:14.000]   at least 190 milligrams per deciliter.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.800]   Very high incidence of atherosclerosis in these people,
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.120]   along with other sort of injuries.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.640]   Like they have so much cholesterol,
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.920]   they accumulate it in their tendons, in their eyes.
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:27.120]   It's a really devastating condition,
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.840]   if not managed correctly.
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:33.320]   And she discovered this mutation in a gene
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:36.280]   for PCSK9 that codes for a protein
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.680]   that degrades LDL receptors.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:43.680]   So these people had hyperfunctioning PCSK9 genes.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.320]   So their genes were just chomping down
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.760]   all the LDL receptors in the liver,
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.840]   so these people weren't clearing LDL.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:54.040]   About five years later, another subset of the population
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.800]   were discovered that were the exact opposite.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.000]   These people had hypofunctioning PCSK9.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.520]   They had virtually unmeasurable,
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.560]   these people had LDL cholesterol levels
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.680]   10 to 20 milligrams per deciliter.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.460]   And not surprisingly, they had no heart disease.
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:10.400]   So that led to the development of a couple of amazing drugs
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.240]   that are now used.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.560]   So I take one of these drugs.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.560]   I've been taking one of these drugs for,
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.520]   I don't know, I probably started in 2015.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:17.880]   So it's an injectable drug.
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.360]   I take it every two weeks,
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.320]   and it's called a PCSK9 inhibitor.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.800]   So the drug blocks the protein,
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.480]   and therefore gives me more LDL receptors,
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.560]   yanks more APOB out of circulation.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.980]   - Interesting, when we were talking about side effects,
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:37.980]   I was thinking, are there any short-term benefits?
[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:40.300]   So I guess we'd call this positive side effects,
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.280]   but let's think of it more directly in line
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.740]   with the underlying biology.
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:47.920]   Let's say my APOB is high,
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.760]   mid-range to high,
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.640]   let's say 100, 80 to 100.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:59.140]   And I improve my insulin resistance through nutrition,
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:01.120]   but we decide it doesn't go down so much,
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:04.180]   so we're going to continue to try and knock this number down.
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:09.180]   And I take any number of different drugs to reduce it.
[01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:11.280]   Do I immediately start to feel better?
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.120]   - Nope.
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:13.460]   - So there's no-- - You feel nothing.
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:14.300]   - Okay. - You feel nothing.
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:17.680]   - And I think that's an important point
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.160]   because of the causality issue
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.360]   that we were talking about earlier.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.960]   Because a lot of people are walking around out there
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.500]   feeling fine, their APOB might be a bit high.
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:28.100]   They either know it or don't know it,
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:30.280]   but they think, well, I'm feeling fine.
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.040]   And you gave a very rational argument earlier
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.000]   as to why because of the causality involved,
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.320]   it makes far more sense to intervene.
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.320]   - Yeah, we don't want to rely on feeling
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.660]   when it comes to atherosclerosis,
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:44.120]   just to put some perspective on this.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.880]   When I was in medical school,
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.840]   we had a, and I think I even write about this in the book,
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.560]   we had a pathology lecture
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.240]   where the professor stands up there and he says,
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:59.840]   "What is the most common presentation of a heart attack?"
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.380]   And you know, us keener first year med students,
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:05.020]   hands shoot straight up, chest pain.
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:06.820]   No, that's not the most common.
[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:10.540]   Oh, shoulder pain, arm radiating down the left arm, no.
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:12.660]   Nausea, shortness of breath, no, no, no.
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:14.500]   We rattled this off for a few minutes.
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:15.940]   And he goes, "Death."
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:20.580]   The single most common presentation
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:23.500]   for a myocardial infarction is death.
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:26.960]   More people, now, I would say today,
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.760]   that was 25 years ago.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:33.040]   Today, it's probably not the most common
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:37.480]   because advanced cardiac life support is so much better,
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:39.960]   but it's still strikingly common.
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:44.040]   - Well, you could say that the best predictor
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.720]   of a heart attack is still a heart attack.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:49.860]   I mean, not saying that the best underlying predictor.
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:52.120]   And actually, this hits home when I was a postdoc,
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.080]   I was living in San Francisco,
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.140]   and I'll never forget this,
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:57.020]   taking my coffee out on my porch in the morning.
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:59.520]   This is right near the UCSF Parnassus campus.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:00.640]   And this guy's walking down the street,
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.000]   he's probably about my age.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:02.920]   And I said, "Hello."
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:03.760]   And he said, "Hello."
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.340]   He walked a few more steps and boom,
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.260]   he just hit the concrete and died right in front of me.
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:10.660]   It took a minute or two to know that he was truly dead.
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:12.300]   I'll never forget it because that's a,
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:15.720]   for a non-surgent, it's an event, right?
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.160]   And I followed up on this and because it's family,
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.360]   you know, the whole thing, 'cause they wanted a report
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.840]   and no cocaine in his system,
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:27.100]   no prior history of any kind of health issues.
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:29.400]   But he was just strolling along and just boom,
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.160]   as if he'd been hit by a bus.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.640]   It's crazy. - Yeah, so it's, I mean,
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:37.200]   again, this is just one of those things where we're gonna,
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.640]   he's spent a lot of time talking about things
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.840]   that feel good and feel bad when you change them, right?
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.680]   Like if you take a person who's not sleeping well,
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.240]   but who thinks they're sleeping well,
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.980]   and you ask them for a leap of faith,
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:48.360]   which is, hey, give me a month
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.280]   to help you sleep really well,
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.700]   yeah, you're gonna feel better.
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:53.000]   You might not know it now
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.760]   because you don't know how bad you're sleeping now.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.800]   You've become acclimated to this.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.360]   But this is not one of those domains.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:01.280]   You know, exercise, nutrition, sleep, all those things,
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:04.240]   when you do those things better, you feel better.
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.820]   But you know, I don't wanna overpromise on this.
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:09.400]   You're not gonna feel better in the moment
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.960]   when you fix your lipids,
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.720]   but you'll feel better when you don't have a heart attack.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.900]   - So by all this logic,
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:16.780]   everybody should get their ApoB measured.
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:18.680]   How early in life should people do that?
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:22.560]   Starting in their 20s, in their 30s?
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.400]   - Certainly if you have a family history
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.960]   that is of any concern.
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:29.000]   Like if I could live my life over again,
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.640]   if I knew everything then that I know today,
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:34.040]   yeah, I would have had mine measured in my 20s.
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:37.200]   I didn't get my ApoB measured for the first time
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:41.400]   probably till I was in my 40s because that's,
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.040]   well, yeah, maybe late 30s, early 40s, right?
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:47.480]   I had my first calcium scan when I was 35,
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.720]   and I had to beg Borrow Steel to get it done
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.220]   'cause everyone was like,
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:53.100]   why does a 35-year-old wanna do this?
[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:56.160]   But I just felt something was wrong
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:59.840]   given my family history, and I'm glad I did.
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.360]   I'm glad I did that 'cause I learned something
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.920]   that completely changed the direction of my life.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.640]   - Okay, I know my ApoB numbers and that I might be that guy
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.580]   who's up in the, you know, above 100,
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.160]   so I'm gonna get this treated.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.320]   That's a promise to myself.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:13.880]   I'd like to just take a brief moment
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.740]   and thank one of our podcast sponsors,
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:17.020]   which is Inside Tracker.
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:19.700]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:22.260]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:23.840]   to help you better understand your body
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.700]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:28.000]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.960]   for the simple reason that blood work is the only way
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:33.320]   that you can monitor the markers such as hormone markers,
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.440]   lipids, metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:38.160]   that impact your immediate and long-term health.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.280]   One major challenge with blood work, however,
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.800]   is that most of the time,
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:44.520]   it does not come back with any information about what to do
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.540]   in order to move the values for hormones, metabolic factors,
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:50.060]   lipids, et cetera, into the ranges that you want.
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.360]   With Inside Tracker,
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.660]   changing those values becomes very straightforward
[01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:56.620]   because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use
[01:17:56.620 --> 01:17:59.660]   to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,
[01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:02.380]   supplement-based approaches that you can use
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.540]   in order to move those values into the ranges
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:06.420]   that are optimal for you, your vitality,
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:07.540]   and your longevity.
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:09.300]   Inside Tracker now includes a measurement
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.780]   of Apolipoprotein B, so-called ApoB,
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:12.940]   in their ultimate plan.
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:15.600]   ApoB is a key marker of cardiovascular health,
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.360]   and therefore, there's extreme value
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.360]   to knowing your ApoB levels.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.760]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.480]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.820]   to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:30.480]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:33.760]   We covered the three major risk factors,
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:37.680]   which were blood pressure, keeping that in check,
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:40.640]   don't smoke, and ApoB,
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:44.540]   and we've now talked about the things to adjust ApoB levels.
[01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:46.360]   We did not really talk about things
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.460]   to adjust blood pressure.
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:50.380]   I'm assuming exercise sits as one of the foremost--
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:51.220]   - Exercise and nutrition, yeah.
[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:53.240]   Weight management is a huge one here.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.620]   So, you know, you take a person who's blood,
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:56.760]   and this is one of those things
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:59.560]   where we don't immediately jump on the pharmacotherapy train
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.020]   with blood pressure,
[01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:03.800]   because here there are side effects sometimes,
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.740]   and you do have to worry about overshooting.
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:07.580]   You don't really have to worry
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:09.360]   about overshooting a person's lipids.
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.480]   We do back off if we overshoot,
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.900]   but it doesn't cause a symptom.
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:16.240]   There's not a short-term immediate risk from doing that.
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:19.000]   If you overshoot somebody's blood pressure medication,
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.960]   you trade one problem for another problem.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.820]   They become lightheaded when they get up to pee at night.
[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.040]   They fall and bang their head.
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:26.740]   That's a devastating consequence, totally unacceptable.
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:30.560]   So our goal is to see how much we can lower blood pressure
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:33.520]   without medication before we turn to medication.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:36.080]   And let's be clear, the meds today
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.240]   are so much better than they used to be.
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.080]   Again, there was a day
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.160]   when the side effects of these medicines were miserable.
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.560]   That's simply not the case today.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:47.720]   I mean, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:50.160]   I mean, these things are very well tolerated,
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.560]   especially the ARBs.
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:56.000]   So again, almost anybody can be on these things,
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.600]   but if we could get a person to lose 10 pounds
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.620]   and exercise every day,
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:02.840]   we see great effects with zone two stuff, right?
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.800]   So kind of the low-intensity cardio.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.120]   - And your recommendation there,
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.360]   I know you talk about this in the book,
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:12.360]   but I've thrown out numbers about 150 to 180 minutes per week
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:13.560]   you go a bit higher.
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:16.360]   - Yeah, we go 180 to 250, 240.
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:18.120]   Yeah, I'd like to see three to four hours a week
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:18.960]   of zone two.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:21.560]   So that's an important piece,
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.800]   and sleep is an important piece.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:26.600]   So get the sleep right, get the exercise right.
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:30.240]   If you're overnourished, let's correct that problem.
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:32.400]   And if all of that doesn't work,
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.880]   and by the way, that works a lot of the time,
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:36.320]   that works most of the time,
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.320]   if that doesn't work, then we've got pharmacotherapy.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:41.160]   There is still a true phenomenon of essential hypertension,
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:45.560]   which is in individuals for whom all the fixable stuff
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:48.360]   has been fixed and they still have high blood pressure,
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.520]   we still have to medicate those folks.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:52.080]   By the way, there's something that I want to mention here
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:55.480]   that doesn't get much attention, but it's so important,
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:58.080]   which is the effect of high blood pressure on the kidney
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.160]   and also the brain itself.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.840]   We've talked about the brain, we've talked about the heart,
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.960]   but the kidney doesn't get enough attention.
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:06.240]   The kidney is a remarkable organ,
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:08.780]   and I think if you're really in this game
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.400]   of trying to live longer, right?
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:14.840]   If you think, hey, maybe we'll live 80, 85 years,
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.240]   but if we kind of start doing all of these other things
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:21.440]   and really optimizing our behaviors, that could be 95.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.560]   Well, you have to start thinking
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:26.040]   about the capacity of the kidney.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:29.240]   And once the glomerular filtration rate
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:32.000]   falls below a certain level,
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.520]   you have to be very careful with how you live your life.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.960]   And unfortunately, this is one of those things
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:40.540]   that is another sort of mistake that's made
[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:42.120]   in kind of modern medicine,
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.040]   which is we don't pay enough attention
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.960]   to how to measure kidney function correctly.
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:50.160]   We rely very heavily on something called creatinine
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.920]   as opposed to looking at another biomarker
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:54.320]   called cystatin C, which is far more accurate.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:57.760]   And we also tolerate too low of a kidney function
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:58.920]   for a person's age.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:02.280]   So we look at, you know, we might look at someone who's 50,
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:06.600]   whose kidney function is at 65%
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:07.920]   and say, you're totally fine.
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:11.120]   Because it's true that at 65%, there is no problem.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:12.000]   But you're not thinking, well,
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.440]   if this person has to live another 40 years
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.320]   and this continues to go down,
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:19.360]   they're going to potentially be staring down the barrel
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.160]   of needing dialysis the last five years of their life.
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:26.220]   Again, you want to die with compromised kidney function,
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:28.800]   but never from compromised kidney function.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:31.240]   In fact, the hazard ratio of all-cause mortality
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.300]   associated with compromised kidney function
[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:36.240]   is even greater than that of heart disease.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:39.500]   Once you cross that threshold, I mean, lights out.
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.340]   Once you are needing dialysis,
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:45.360]   I mean, your risk of death is higher than that
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.700]   of someone with high blood pressure, smoking,
[01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:49.060]   even someone who has cancer.
[01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:50.640]   You have a higher risk of death
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:53.080]   having end-stage renal disease than you do having cancer.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:57.960]   So the kidney is so sensitive to blood pressure.
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:02.200]   This is a tiny organ that on every pump of your heart
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:04.260]   is getting 20 to 25% of your blood.
[01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:09.280]   So just imagine how sensitive and susceptible it is
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:11.360]   to elevated blood pressure.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:15.160]   - We've covered quite a few corners
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:19.580]   of avoiding the major killer, arthrosclerosis.
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:22.400]   Let's talk about cancer.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:25.420]   Nobody wants cancer.
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.720]   Everybody seems to know somebody who has had
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:30.320]   or has died of cancer, and probably no surprise
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.180]   given that it's number two on the list.
[01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:37.180]   What are the numbers and what can people do to offset cancer?
[01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:41.360]   And of course, there are a huge number
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.760]   of different types of cancer.
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:47.820]   And inside of this conversation, I just want to earmark
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:51.680]   that it might be good to have a conversation about alcohol,
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:55.520]   which we didn't talk about in the last discussion.
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:24:00.400]   But if alcohol is involved or is a risk factor rather
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:03.360]   for a cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease,
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:06.400]   now would probably be the time to mention it.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:10.440]   - Yeah, this has been looked at in a number of ways.
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:15.280]   And so if you look at sort of top line epidemiology,
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.740]   and you've heard of these things called the French paradox,
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:21.040]   which is, oh, come on, like they eat all of this fatty stuff
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.260]   and drink all this wine and they have a slightly lower risk
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:25.980]   of cardiovascular disease, you just have to kind of throw
[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:28.300]   that stuff out the window 'cause there's so many confounders
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:30.980]   there that it's kind of useless epidemiology.
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:32.840]   If you really look at the data clearly,
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:35.380]   and there was actually a really elegant analysis
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:38.460]   that included some genetic studies that came out of JAMA
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:42.220]   about a year ago, it's actually pretty clear
[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:45.220]   that there is no dose of ethanol that is healthy.
[01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:48.700]   Okay, so there's no J curve.
[01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:51.500]   So it used to, there used to be kind of this literature
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:54.600]   that said there's a J curve associated with ethanol.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:58.720]   So meaning at total abstinence,
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:01.480]   there's a slightly higher risk of death
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.320]   than if you're drinking one drink a day,
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.020]   and then if you go beyond one drink a day,
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:08.760]   the rate of death starts to climb.
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.000]   The problem with that analysis,
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.180]   so there's just been a lot of consternation around that,
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:16.200]   but the problem with those analyses are multiple,
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.960]   but the most important of these are that the abstainers
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:23.000]   have a reason for abstaining typically,
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.660]   and those reasons can't be extracted statistically
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:28.780]   from these analyses.
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:31.440]   So I'll leave it at that without,
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.640]   I mean, I've written many blog posts about this.
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:35.320]   If people are really interested,
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.600]   they can go and talk about that.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:38.360]   I also do talk about this a little bit in the book,
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:43.360]   by the way, but the short answer is there is no dose
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.320]   of ethanol that is healthy.
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:48.440]   I would argue that it's not a straight line of risk,
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:50.960]   but it probably goes, I think from zero to one,
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:55.280]   there's probably no measurable harm for most people.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.120]   - One per day or one per week?
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.280]   - Probably one per day, up to one per day.
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:03.320]   It's probably very difficult to discern the harm,
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:06.160]   but I'm gonna put a caveat on that that I'll come back to,
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.000]   and then I think the risk starts to climb
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   pretty steeply after that,
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.760]   and I think it climbs non-linearly after that.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:14.220]   That is my reading of the literature.
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:16.760]   Okay, so then how do you decide
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:19.120]   if you're gonna have up to one drink a day?
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:21.560]   And by the way, that's not the same as seven a week,
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:24.160]   because that doesn't mean seven in a day.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:27.240]   - Right, which we know is really detrimental.
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.400]   - Right.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:29.960]   - Especially for the brain,
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:34.960]   but also the cascades that result from disrupted sleep,
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.360]   not just for that one night, but multiple nights.
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.560]   Yeah, the literature I've seen on alcohol,
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:44.360]   the most, now again, this is an emerging literature
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:47.080]   because what you're describing is exactly right,
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:49.760]   but people are now, some more conservative folks
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:54.400]   are starting to place it at two drinks per week total,
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:56.680]   beyond which you start running into issues,
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:58.920]   especially for women in terms of breast cancer risk,
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.720]   which is something maybe we can circle back on.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:03.160]   - Yeah, I mean, look, my view is
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:05.040]   if you can not drink at all,
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.360]   you're better off not drinking at all.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:08.200]   And people always say to me,
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:09.600]   "Well, Peter, what's your view on this?"
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.340]   And my view is I do drink.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:15.320]   I'll go weeks at a time without having a drink.
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:17.120]   I haven't had a drink, you know,
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.360]   I've had one drink since I saw you last a couple weeks ago
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.640]   because I've been sick, so I'm thinking,
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:23.400]   well, gosh, like, the deck is stacked against me right now.
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.520]   Why would I do anything to stack it more?
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:30.560]   But my philosophy, which is half tongue in cheek,
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:34.240]   but is true, is like, I just don't drink bad alcohol.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.840]   You know, I sort of, my wife saw me do this the other day.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:39.580]   We opened up a bottle of wine,
[01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:41.640]   and it was a very expensive bottle of wine,
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:44.120]   I took a sip and I was like, yeah, I just dumped my glass.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:46.440]   I was like, I don't know, just doesn't taste right to me.
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:47.400]   And it tasted fine to her,
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:49.040]   so I don't think it was that the wine had spoiled,
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.080]   it was just, I didn't like the taste of it enough
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:52.720]   to justify drinking it.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:53.620]   I was like, I don't feel like drinking it.
[01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:56.440]   - Yeah, fortunately, there were times in life,
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.480]   certainly college and portions of graduate school
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:00.540]   when I drank, but I've never really enjoyed
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:03.960]   the taste or experience of alcohol.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.440]   So all the alcohol in the plant could disappear,
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:07.260]   I wouldn't even notice,
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:08.740]   but I'll have one every once in a while,
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.280]   I'm sort of of that mindset.
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:13.800]   But, great to hear that zero is better than any,
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:16.920]   'cause I think everyone agrees on that.
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:22.320]   So, it doesn't appear that alcohol can be directly linked
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.920]   to cardiovascular disease and cerebral vascular disease,
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:26.720]   although there are these indirect effects
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:28.720]   through insulin, altering insulin sensitivity.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:31.740]   - And through sleep, I think the impact of sleep
[01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:34.000]   on cardiovascular and cerebral vascular disease is profound,
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.280]   and I do think that the impact of ethanol on sleep
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.320]   is underappreciated.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:44.080]   - Yeah, and here, I think we should do a little nod
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:46.120]   to Matt Walker, the great Matt Walker,
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:49.820]   because 10 years ago, if someone had a conversation
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:51.860]   about sleep and how critical it is
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:55.900]   and how not getting enough quality sleep is dangerous,
[01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:57.400]   people would have just kind of shake their heads
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.520]   and say, what's the evidence for that?
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.680]   I think Matt really deserves most of the credit
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:05.200]   for alerting people to these issues
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.380]   around not getting enough sleep.
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:09.460]   It's just remarkable what's happened in the last decade,
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:11.020]   thanks to Matt.
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:12.700]   - And while we're on that topic,
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:14.460]   we have the other next horseman of death,
[01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:15.760]   the neurodegenerative diseases,
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.340]   I think those are also heavily impacted,
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:20.500]   especially on the dementia side by ethanol.
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:24.060]   So, again, I wanna be careful when I say this stuff, right?
[01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:26.980]   I don't believe in fear mongering, okay?
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:28.720]   I just said a moment ago, I'll say it again,
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.420]   I drink alcohol and I'm gonna continue to drink alcohol,
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:34.920]   but I think that one has to make the trade-offs,
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:38.500]   which is like, if I really do love the taste
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:39.760]   of certain Spanish wines,
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.420]   I really do love the taste of certain tequilas,
[01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:45.140]   certain mezcals, and I really do love the taste
[01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:48.720]   of certain weird esoteric Belgian beers.
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:53.060]   And it really does give me pleasure to consume those things
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:54.960]   in the same way it gives me pleasure
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:59.460]   to consume certain foods that are quite vapid, right?
[01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:02.700]   You know, there's no upside in consuming a brownie
[01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:05.080]   that my kid just made, except for the fact
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:06.340]   that my kid just made it,
[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:08.440]   and it's fun to eat the brownie with them, right?
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:12.680]   So, you know, we come back to this thing about,
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:15.020]   like, longevity is also about healthspan,
[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:17.820]   and part of healthspan is quality of life.
[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:20.220]   And, you know, I write about this in the book
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:23.120]   that I think there was a day when my approach to this
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:25.080]   was purely an engineering approach,
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:29.440]   which was we were going to optimize every molecule
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:31.700]   of my being for this.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:34.520]   And if you go so far down that rabbit hole
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:37.560]   that the quality of your life deteriorates,
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:39.160]   what's the point?
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:41.920]   So that's why I think for somebody like you,
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.720]   who says, like, you could take all the alcohol
[01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:45.840]   off the face of the earth, I wouldn't even notice,
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:48.720]   then that's a great reason not to bother drinking.
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:51.040]   I wouldn't put myself at the opposite end of that spectrum,
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:53.680]   but I'm probably further to the spectrum, you know,
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:57.960]   where, yeah, if you told me I could never drink alcohol
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.800]   again, I would be fine with it,
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.000]   but I'd be giving something up that I enjoy.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:06.660]   But at the same time, I know if I have two drinks
[01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:10.140]   with dinner, my sleep sucks, and therefore,
[01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:14.320]   that's just a threshold I rarely, rarely cross.
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:17.580]   - I certainly have my vices of alcohol,
[01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:19.600]   just doesn't happen to be one of them.
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:22.500]   What about cancer?
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:24.620]   Again, nobody wants cancer.
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:27.260]   We've all known people who have died of cancer
[01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:29.120]   or have had cancer.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:32.860]   What can be done to reduce one's risk of cancer?
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:35.260]   - Well, you asked earlier about the numbers,
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:36.860]   so let's throw some numbers out there, right?
[01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:39.860]   So globally, we're talking about 11, 12 million deaths
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:43.580]   per year, about half the number of ASCVD,
[01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:45.220]   still a staggering number.
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:49.260]   At the individual level, put it this way,
[01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:52.340]   somewhere between one in three and one in four chance,
[01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:53.860]   anyone listening to this or watching,
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:55.900]   this is gonna get cancer in their lifetime.
[01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:59.380]   - But what's the probability they will die from that cancer?
[01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:02.160]   - Half of that, about a one in six chance of dying.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:06.240]   - Okay, so is it true that every male gets prostate cancer?
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.400]   In other words, from their deathbed, then have--
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.960]   - Every man will die with prostate cancer
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:12.300]   and some will die from it.
[01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:14.960]   - Got it.
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.640]   - You and I have prostate cancer right now.
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:17.680]   - Thank you for informing me.
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:19.200]   - Yes.
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.400]   Hopefully, we will not die of it.
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:21.240]   We should not die of it.
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:23.960]   Prostate cancer, colon cancer are cancers
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.520]   that no one should ever die from
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:28.040]   because they're so easy to screen for,
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:31.960]   they're so easy to treat when they are in their infancy
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:33.160]   that it's totally unacceptable
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:34.160]   that people are dying from this.
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.360]   There are other cancers for which I can't really say that.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.320]   Breast cancer, much more complicated.
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:40.780]   Pancreatic cancer, much more complicated.
[01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:42.960]   Glioblastomy multiforme, much more complicated.
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:47.080]   So as you said a second ago, cancer is not a disease,
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:49.200]   it is a category of diseases.
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.880]   Each, it's not just that each organ is different
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:53.940]   and breast differs from pancreatic,
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:57.260]   it's that within breast cancer, ERPR positive,
[01:32:57.260 --> 01:32:59.940]   HER2/neu positive is a totally different disease
[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:01.660]   from the triple negative breast cancers.
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:04.300]   - Those with BRCA mutations or non-BRCA mutations.
[01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:05.960]   - Well, even putting that aside,
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:08.040]   just looking at the hormone profile
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:09.600]   of the individual breast cancers,
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.580]   they're totally different diseases.
[01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:13.400]   So it's not just that breast cancer
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.680]   is different from prostate cancer,
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:17.700]   it's that all breast cancers are quite different.
[01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:19.500]   - Maybe I should frame the question a little differently
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:22.580]   than given the vast number of different types of cancers
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:23.420]   and categories within those.
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:25.240]   - Your question is still a fair one.
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:26.600]   I just wanted to throw that caveat out there.
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:27.760]   So now to your question.
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:29.620]   Okay, so what do we know?
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:34.060]   It turns out that we can very comfortably speak
[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:37.420]   to several things.
[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:40.260]   One is the role that genes play.
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:44.600]   So maybe I'll just spend one second
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:49.360]   on a gene 101 thing for the viewer.
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.720]   We want to differentiate between
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:54.420]   what are called germline mutations and somatic mutations.
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:59.320]   So your germline and my germline are set.
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:03.340]   When we were born, our germline mutations,
[01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:05.480]   any mutations we have in germline genes
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:07.240]   are inherited from our parents.
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:09.720]   - They're non-negotiable.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.860]   - They're non-negotiable, you got those things.
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:16.540]   So question one is how much of cancer results
[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:19.800]   from those types of genetic mutations?
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:22.360]   And the answer is very little, less than 5%.
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:25.280]   So very, you mentioned one a moment ago, BRCA.
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:29.000]   Okay, so mutations in BRCA are germline mutations.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.320]   A woman will get a BRCA mutation from one of her parents.
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:36.440]   And we will often have a sense of that
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:37.960]   just from the family history.
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:41.480]   When mom and sister and aunt and grandmother
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:44.740]   had breast cancer, you've got a breast cancer gene.
[01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:46.940]   Now it might be BRCA, it might be another gene
[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:50.320]   that's not BRCA, but there's no ambiguity.
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.540]   And we test for these genes,
[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:54.980]   mostly just for insurance purposes, frankly.
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:57.980]   But there's no ambiguity that that was a germline
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:01.140]   transmission of a gene that is driving cancer.
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:07.020]   But 95 plus percent of cancers are not arising
[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:08.340]   from germline mutations.
[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:10.720]   They are arising from somatic mutations
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.220]   or acquired mutations.
[01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:15.380]   So the question then becomes,
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:17.760]   what is driving somatic mutation?
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:23.840]   And the two clearest indications
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:28.200]   of drivers of somatic mutation are smoking and obesity.
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:30.400]   Smoking we've talked about.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:31.720]   Let's put that aside for a moment.
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:33.320]   - I'm so surprised about obesity.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:36.600]   I don't know why I'm surprised, but I've never heard this.
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.360]   I'm probably just naive to the literature.
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:43.040]   - Yeah, so obesity is now the second most prevalent
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.460]   environmental driver of cancer.
[01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:49.240]   Now I will argue, and I think I argue this in the book,
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:51.420]   hopefully pretty convincingly,
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:53.440]   I don't think it's obesity per se.
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:56.860]   I think obesity is just a masquerading proxy.
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:57.700]   What is obesity?
[01:35:57.700 --> 01:36:01.780]   Obesity simply is defined by body mass index.
[01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:04.700]   Well, first of all, I don't think I'm obese,
[01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:07.380]   but I'm way overweight on BMI.
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:08.600]   You probably are too.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.260]   So let's just ignore--
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:12.580]   - I'm clinically diagnosable as obese.
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:13.420]   - Are you?
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:14.240]   - Oh, no.
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:15.080]   Well, not, well, clinically maybe--
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:16.220]   - That would be BMI over 30.
[01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:17.800]   I don't think you're probably there.
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:21.040]   - No, but if I measure my weight by height--
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:21.880]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:23.920]   Like my BMI is probably 27 or 28.
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:25.720]   - Okay, it's been a little while since I've checked.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.920]   I can, I only know body fat percentages
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:28.760]   and things like that.
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:32.060]   - So basically like BMI is a far from perfect proxy,
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:35.660]   but at the population level, it's what we use.
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:37.560]   I wish we would get off it, by the way.
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.100]   I think it's really crap.
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:41.660]   - Because it doesn't take into account lean versus--
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:45.260]   - Yeah, I think we could get better data
[01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:48.700]   if we looked at waist to height ratio.
[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:50.540]   That's a way better metric.
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:52.900]   So this is just a quick test for everybody.
[01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:57.620]   It's, I'm gonna argue your BMI is less relevant to me
[01:36:57.620 --> 01:37:02.060]   than your eye color, but if your waist circumference
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:05.740]   is more than 50% of your height, you should be concerned.
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:06.940]   - Okay, well then I'm okay.
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:09.140]   - Yeah, you're fine by that metric, right?
[01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:09.980]   But that's important.
[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:12.020]   If you're six feet tall,
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:15.440]   your waist better be under 36 inches.
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.900]   And if it's over, I would argue that's the definition
[01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:21.940]   of obesity, not your BMI being over 30.
[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:24.900]   So back to this issue,
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:28.180]   because we're using such a crude measurement,
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:30.660]   it basically is catching a whole bunch of stuff,
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:33.620]   but the question is, what's driving it?
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:38.620]   And I think if you really look at the physiology of cancer,
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:40.980]   I don't think it's obesity.
[01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:44.780]   I think it's two things that come with obesity.
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:49.780]   Insulin resistance, which is 2/3 to 3/4 of obese individuals
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:53.980]   are insulin resistant, and inflammation.
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:56.460]   And I think those two things, with the inflammation
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:59.740]   and the immune dysfunction, with the insulin resistance,
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:04.740]   and the hyper basically tonic growth stimulus that's coming,
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:06.700]   that's what's driving cancer.
[01:38:06.700 --> 01:38:10.780]   So again, is it because a person is storing extra fat,
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:12.300]   you know, and their love handles,
[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:13.780]   that that's driving the risk of cancer?
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:16.140]   No, those are just two things
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.580]   that are coming along for the ride.
[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:21.260]   So beyond those two things,
[01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:25.300]   and along with, there are also certain environmental toxins
[01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:26.900]   we absolutely know are doing this, right?
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:30.300]   So we understand that people who have exposure to asbestos
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:32.420]   have a much higher risk of certain types of lung cancers
[01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:33.260]   and things like that.
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:36.300]   But for the most part, those are our big risks.
[01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:39.300]   Beyond that, we talk about alcohol in certain cases,
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:43.260]   absolutely, alcohol is a carcinogen.
[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:45.460]   The dose part still isn't clear to me.
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:50.540]   I don't know, is one drink a day
[01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:53.060]   moving the needle much on cancer risk per se?
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:53.900]   It's not clear.
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:57.140]   - And it might depend on those genetic predispositions.
[01:38:57.140 --> 01:39:02.140]   - Yes, so yeah, if step one is don't get cancer,
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:06.380]   you have no control over your genes,
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:08.700]   you have control over smoking,
[01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:12.060]   you have control over insulin sensitivity,
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:14.660]   I wish I could sit here and tell you
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:18.460]   that there is a proven anti-cancer diet
[01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:23.900]   or that if you do X amount of exercise per week,
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:26.660]   you're gonna not get cancer.
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:30.340]   We just don't have a fraction of the control over cancer
[01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:32.820]   that we have with cardiovascular disease.
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:35.660]   We don't understand the disease well enough,
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:38.700]   so we don't understand kind of the initiation process
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:40.180]   and the propagation process.
[01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:46.940]   And we have to rely much more on screening.
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:51.540]   - Are there good whole body screens for cancer?
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:54.820]   In other words, can I walk into a tube
[01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:59.860]   or a cylinder rather and get screened
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:03.340]   for the presence of tumors any and everywhere in the body?
[01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:04.180]   Outside the brain,
[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:06.260]   'cause the brain's a little harder to get to, right?
[01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:07.100]   - Believe it or not,
[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:08.780]   the brain is actually pretty easy to screen for.
[01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:11.620]   - 'Cause it's so fatty and floating in water.
[01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:13.220]   - Well, and also the head,
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:14.900]   when you put the head into an MRI scanner,
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:16.640]   there's no movement.
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:19.140]   It's the least motion artifact is in the brain.
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:21.660]   So when you use something called diffusion weighted imaging
[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:23.980]   with background subtraction in an MRI,
[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:26.700]   a technology that was actually pioneered in the brain
[01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:29.040]   for stroke identification,
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.800]   it's also really good at looking for tumors as well.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:37.940]   So let me make the argument for why screening matters,
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:40.120]   'cause this is again kind of an area
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:43.860]   where I go far down a rabbit hole
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:45.420]   in a way that I think traditional medicine
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:47.940]   would argue against.
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:51.820]   So my argument for screening is an argument
[01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:55.220]   at the individual level, and it goes as follows.
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:59.520]   To my knowledge, there is not a single example
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:03.480]   of a cancer that is more effectively treated
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:05.500]   when the burden of cancer cells in the body
[01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.100]   is higher than when it is lower.
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:12.140]   So the two examples I think I talk about in the book
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:14.680]   are colon cancer and breast cancer.
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:18.780]   So when you take an individual with stage four colon cancer,
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:21.480]   that means that the cancer has left the colon
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:23.440]   and is now outside of the colon.
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.680]   So it's usually in the liver at a minimum,
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:27.740]   potentially in the lungs or in the brain.
[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:32.040]   That person's five year survival is very low,
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:33.640]   their 10 year survival is zero.
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:38.160]   We will treat them with a very aggressive regimen
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:40.180]   of multiple drugs.
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:42.540]   And again, you'll get a five year survival
[01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:46.820]   of maybe 10 to 20%, and by 10 years nobody's alive.
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:52.720]   If you take a person with stage three colon cancer,
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:56.780]   so the colon cancer is big, and it's even in the lymph nodes
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:42:00.560]   around the colon, but at least grossly,
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:03.040]   you can't see colon cancer cell,
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:05.040]   you can't see those cells in the liver.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:07.240]   Microscopically, of course, we know they're there,
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:09.060]   because if you don't treat those patients,
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:10.560]   they still die of colon cancer,
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:13.600]   but you whack them with the same chemo regimen
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.240]   that you were gonna give the metastatic patients,
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:19.200]   80% of those people are alive in five years.
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:22.100]   So night and day difference in survival.
[01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:23.360]   What's the difference?
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:25.160]   In the person with metastatic cancer,
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:29.280]   you're treating a person with hundreds of billions of cells.
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:33.000]   In the adjuvant setting, which is what we call it adjuvant,
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.520]   when you treat people who have only microscopic disease,
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:39.480]   you're treating billions of cells.
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:40.760]   The same is true with breast cancer.
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:43.040]   So we have the clinical trial data to put them side by side.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:47.360]   So rule number one is don't get cancer.
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.720]   Rule number two is catch cancer as early as possible
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:51.500]   if you're gonna get it.
[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:52.480]   Which brings us to your question
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:53.880]   of how do you screen for it?
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:59.820]   We basically screen, the first line of screening is imaging,
[01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:02.260]   is a sort of visualization.
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:04.460]   So you have cancers that occur outside the body
[01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:06.240]   that you can look at directly.
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:09.600]   So skin cancer, you can look directly at the skin.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.400]   Esophageal, gastric, colon cancer,
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.460]   those are outside the body, right?
[01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:16.520]   Mouth to anus, embryologically is outside the body.
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:17.760]   So you can put a scope in
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:20.320]   and you can look directly at the cancer.
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:23.100]   But for all other cancers that are inside the body,
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:26.360]   yeah, you have to rely on some sort of imaging modality.
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:28.080]   Although now we're starting to look at things,
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.220]   things called liquid biopsies.
[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:31.960]   So blood tests that are looking for cell-free DNA.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:35.640]   And the cell-free DNA gives us a sense of,
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:39.260]   based on the epigenetic signature of what you're looking at,
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:41.020]   hey, is there a cancer in the body?
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:43.440]   And if so, what tissue is it potentially coming from
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:45.300]   based on these epigenetic signatures?
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:50.520]   So the problem with relying on any one modality
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:55.040]   is a problem of sensitivity and specificity optimization.
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:56.880]   Now with MRI scanners,
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:59.680]   which are in some ways the best way to do this
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:01.320]   because they don't have radiation.
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:03.840]   So you don't wanna be incurring damage as you do this.
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:06.200]   The irony of doing a whole body CT scan,
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:09.860]   screening for cancer is your whole body CT scan
[01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:14.640]   would be close to 30 to 50 millisieverts of radiation.
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:16.120]   It's a staggering sum of radiation.
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:17.040]   So-
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:18.640]   - Does that mean that people should,
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:19.800]   sorry to pull you off this,
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:24.280]   but I was going to ask about this anyway,
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:26.760]   avoiding going through the whole body scanner
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.320]   at the airport.
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:30.480]   - Noise, solo, solo.
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:33.200]   Yeah, going through a whole body scanner at the airport
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.440]   or even getting a DEXA scan.
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:36.920]   I mean, these are trivial amounts of radiation.
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:37.920]   - What about flying?
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:42.160]   You hear that pilots get more cancer.
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:45.960]   - If you're a pilot who's flying over the North Pole
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:47.040]   back and forth and back and forth,
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:51.280]   you're probably getting five to 10 millisieverts a year.
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:53.560]   The NRC suggests that nobody should get
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:55.360]   more than 50 millisieverts a year.
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:58.760]   - So you and I both travel a fair amount,
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:02.120]   but typical travel for the busy person,
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:05.200]   let's say two round trip flights
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:08.020]   of more than two hours per month
[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:10.600]   and an international trip every three months.
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:13.320]   - Probably still less than a millisievert a year.
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:16.320]   - Yeah, living at sea level, one millisievert a year,
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:17.760]   living at a mile elevation.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:18.600]   If you lived in Denver,
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.160]   you're at two millisieverts a year basically.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:22.520]   - I'd have to ask standing in front of the microwave.
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:23.520]   (laughing)
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:26.680]   I'm just, we've got friends, they ask.
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:29.460]   - With or without testes on the counter.
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:33.180]   - That's an inside joke that unfortunately,
[01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:35.420]   and fortunately deserves no description.
[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:37.880]   And Peter's not referring to me.
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:41.680]   But people worry about other sources of radiation.
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:44.640]   So it doesn't sound like the microwave is a concern.
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:46.980]   What are the other major sources of radiation?
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:49.640]   - I mean, outside of sort of nuclear stuff
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:50.480]   where things go sadly wrong.
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:52.280]   - Yeah, if you live near a plant or there's been a--
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:55.160]   - Yeah, there's been a, it's mostly at the hands
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.360]   of medical professionals, right?
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.880]   It's the CT scanner and the PET scanner are hands down
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:00.300]   the biggest source of radiation.
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:03.060]   - What about the x-rays of the dentist when they scurry
[01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:05.360]   behind the wall, put me under the blanket?
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:08.320]   - They're very low, relatively speaking.
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.800]   Fluoroscopy is very high.
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:14.120]   They tend to try to cover up all of you.
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:17.160]   So for example, if they were doing a fluoroscopic study
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:19.280]   of your kidney because you had a stone
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:22.400]   or if you were getting an injection into,
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:25.480]   if they were doing a fluoroscopic guided injection
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:27.320]   of one of your discs in your neck,
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.260]   that would be a locally pretty high dose.
[01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:31.860]   But they're gonna cover the hell out of you elsewhere.
[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:33.960]   And again, if you get one of these things,
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:35.260]   it's not the end of the world.
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:37.040]   But boy, I wouldn't wanna be getting one a month.
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:38.920]   And back to the point about screening,
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:44.000]   a chest, abdomen, pelvis CT scan is probably,
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.140]   I mean, look, there's probably a scanner out there now
[01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:49.080]   that's moving fast enough that it's much lower.
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:50.560]   But I'll give you an example, okay.
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:52.620]   Remember how I talked about we do CT angiograms
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:55.560]   on all of our patients for coronary artery disease?
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:47:00.240]   An off the shelf scanner for this
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:03.080]   is 20 millisieverts of radiation.
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:05.120]   - Okay, so calibrate me because--
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:08.020]   - That's 40% of your annual allotment.
[01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:10.660]   - Oh wow, so the medical practitioners
[01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:13.740]   really are the major culprits here.
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:16.880]   - That's right, so what we say is,
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:20.520]   and I think most doctors are now realizing this is,
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:23.820]   no, no, it behooves you to pay a little bit more
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:25.800]   to go to a really good place
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:28.580]   that can do that scan for two millisieverts.
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:31.460]   Meaning they have a much faster CT scanner,
[01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:34.960]   much better software, and they're better engineers.
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:36.260]   So they have better engineering
[01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:38.700]   that they can do on the scanner to get that done.
[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:41.780]   So if someone's listening to this, here's my take.
[01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:45.460]   Do not get a CT scan or any imaging study
[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:47.940]   without asking how much radiation am I seeing?
[01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:50.520]   And if a person can't tell you how many millisieverts
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:52.260]   of radiation you're being exposed to,
[01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:53.380]   then just say I'm gonna wait a minute
[01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:55.040]   until somebody can tell me that.
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:48:00.180]   And keep in mind, if 50 is the most
[01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:02.840]   you should ever be exposed to in a year,
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:04.260]   there better be a damn good reason
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:05.740]   why I'm gonna get 25 in a day.
[01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:07.740]   Now there are some people who have to do this.
[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:11.460]   If you're a cancer patient and they're scanning you
[01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:12.660]   as a part of your treatment,
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:15.120]   I mean, you have to pick and choose
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:17.380]   between those two opportunities.
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:19.940]   So I don't also don't wanna create some fear-mongering
[01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:22.020]   where oh my God, if you hit 50 in a year, you're hosed.
[01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:24.740]   No, it's just I wouldn't wanna hit 50 a year
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:25.940]   every year for my whole life.
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:28.940]   And I certainly wouldn't wanna be hitting hundreds a year
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:30.380]   for any period of time.
[01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:32.140]   - I think we're just trying to raise awareness
[01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:35.680]   and also calibrate people to what the sources are
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:37.980]   and so they can make good choices
[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:42.020]   not to place them into a chronic state of fear
[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:42.860]   or even an acute state of fear.
[01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:45.860]   - So for that reason, we prefer MRI scanners
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:47.460]   'cause there's no radiation.
[01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:51.340]   - I realize this might sound like a specialized circumstance
[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:54.280]   but I'll just start off with my own,
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:55.620]   which is when I was a graduate student,
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:59.060]   I worked with fixatives of paraformaldehyde,
[01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:01.700]   paraformaldehyde, excuse me, glutaraldehyde.
[01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:03.260]   We know that these are mutagens.
[01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:04.860]   They mutate cells, not good.
[01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:06.540]   You do some molecular biology in the lab,
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:09.380]   you use DNA intercalating dye, those little bands and gels.
[01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:11.280]   The reason they label is 'cause they get between the DNA,
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:14.920]   not good to get into your own DNA.
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:18.280]   And that's a very specialized circumstance.
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:22.540]   I also injected radioactive proline into the animals
[01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:23.840]   and things of that sort.
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:24.840]   Again, very specialized.
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:29.840]   And yet most people I think will be exposed to pesticides.
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:33.480]   They'll put stuff on their lawn
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:37.040]   or they'll have paint thinners and things of that sort.
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:40.640]   Is there any sense of what the average, if one can,
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:44.720]   average risk is incurred in terms of carcinogens
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:48.820]   just through this interaction with weed killers,
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:52.960]   paint thinner, detergents around the house
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:56.100]   that we now know, there's some major lawsuits
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:59.660]   that have been successful against the manufacturers
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:00.640]   of these things.
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:03.000]   And what is the real cancer risk created
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.560]   by having those kinds of solvents and pesticides
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:08.220]   and things around?
[01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:09.940]   - I don't think I know, truthfully.
[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:13.760]   I think it's very complicated to calculate such things
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:17.460]   when their ubiquity is so high.
[01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:22.520]   So one argument is, look, it's kind of baked into
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:26.200]   the baseline prevalence of cancer today
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:28.600]   because these things are so ubiquitous.
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:31.280]   - Asbestos, in California, for whatever reason,
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:33.160]   it seems that there's an asbestos warning
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.240]   on pretty much every building, if you look carefully enough,
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:38.600]   except maybe the ones built in the last five years.
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:40.000]   I don't think I've ever worked in a building
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.320]   where the elevator was updated in terms of the inspection.
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:45.840]   It was almost like 10 years back.
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:47.160]   You always see it while you're in the elevator.
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:48.720]   No one seems to worry about those.
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:53.720]   Or where there was not an asbestos warning or a lead warning.
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:56.000]   It seems like it's just kind of everywhere
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.140]   and they're noting it in these little flags.
[01:50:58.140 --> 01:50:59.440]   I don't walk around worried about it.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:01.000]   I don't lose sleep over it.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.360]   But it sounds like a real risk
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:03.360]   or else they wouldn't bother, right?
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:04.920]   Clearly they're just trying to cover their legal backs.
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:08.160]   - Yeah, it might be more CYA than anything at this point.
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:11.360]   I don't know how much of a risk asbestos poses
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:14.360]   when it's not being agitated.
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:16.820]   In other words, I don't know that the asbestos
[01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:20.800]   in the ceiling four layers up is really a problem.
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:24.360]   But if they had to come in here and rip this ceiling apart,
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:25.920]   I don't know that it'd want to be in here either.
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:27.760]   - It was like post-9/11, a lot of the workers
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:30.720]   selling the World Trade Center pits,
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:32.720]   'cause that's what was left, sadly,
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:34.920]   were developed cancers, right?
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:36.600]   Probably from exposure and those kinds of things.
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:41.200]   - Well, I mean, I would argue it's also just the unbelievable
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:44.120]   amount of pollution, micropollution that was in the air
[01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:45.420]   following those things.
[01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:46.440]   I mean, that's devastating stuff.
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:49.640]   So yeah, those are fortunately the outlier events
[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:50.900]   that are dramatic.
[01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:54.780]   But again, my focus is basically, look,
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:57.920]   I could hermetically seal myself somewhere in the world,
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:02.920]   maybe, and maybe that would reduce my risk by 1%.
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:06.020]   But I'm gonna focus my energy on what I control,
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:08.020]   'cause that's really hard for me to control.
[01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:11.580]   I like focusing my energy on things I can control.
[01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:14.600]   What I can control is the timing
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:16.100]   and frequency of my screening.
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:19.340]   I can't control my genes anymore.
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:20.180]   They are what they are.
[01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:23.300]   I got whatever predisposing cancer genes I'm gonna get.
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:26.120]   I might be lucky in this regard in that I seem to get
[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:27.640]   all these horrible heart disease genes,
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:28.600]   and maybe not as much.
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:31.960]   But you can also argue there are cancer bad genes in me
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:33.280]   that we don't really know about
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:35.920]   because everybody was dying of heart disease so young.
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:39.880]   But boy, am I gonna control the screening thing.
[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:41.880]   - What source of genetic screening
[01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:43.760]   do you recommend to your patients?
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:44.640]   'Cause there are a lot of them.
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:47.240]   There's 23andMe, there's whole genome sequencing
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:50.800]   in place available now in a variety of formats.
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:51.920]   - This is actually one of the questions
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:53.960]   our research team is working on as we speak.
[01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:58.600]   So we're trying to decide,
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:00.360]   so we do genetic screening for certain things.
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:02.760]   Like ApoE is a gene we wanna know in everybody.
[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:06.280]   - For its role in neurodegenerative disease.
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:09.360]   - Correct, specifically in Alzheimer's disease.
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:14.360]   We are selectively using cancer screening in some patients.
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:19.000]   But in our practice, it's less important
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.600]   because we're generally so aggressive anyway
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:24.160]   that it turns out to be a little bit moot.
[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:26.560]   We don't learn a lot in the genetic screening
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:29.800]   that's changing our screening practices
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:32.120]   because we're so thorough in our family history
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:34.480]   and we're so aggressive in everybody
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:36.680]   regardless of family history.
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:38.760]   But I think there's a place for these things.
[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:40.560]   For example, if you're looking for reimbursement
[01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:43.400]   on certain tests, I'll give you an example.
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:47.800]   So colon cancer historically was not covered by,
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:49.440]   a colonoscopy screening for colon cancer
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:50.920]   was not covered until you were 50.
[01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:53.040]   That's been bumped to 45.
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:54.840]   We still think everybody should be screened
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:55.960]   no later than 40.
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:58.040]   - No, I haven't had one, so I suppose I should.
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:00.840]   - Yeah, I mean look, I'm 50 and I've had three already.
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:03.160]   So again, why?
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:06.720]   Because colon cancer is not just the third leading cause
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:10.600]   of cancer death, it's 100% preventable.
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:11.440]   Why?
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:14.960]   Because every colon cancer comes from a polyp
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:17.540]   and every polyp can be seen on a colonoscopy.
[01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:21.460]   So there's simply no reason to not know that.
[01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:23.620]   And that has to be weighed against the cost
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:27.540]   of the colonoscopy, both the financial cost and the risks,
[01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:30.800]   which are very low but not zero.
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:35.160]   There's a risk that comes from electrolyte abnormalities
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:37.580]   and hypotension from the bowel prep.
[01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:39.420]   There's a risk from the sedation.
[01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:42.220]   And there's obviously a risk of bleeding or perforation
[01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:43.500]   that comes from the colonoscopy itself.
[01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:46.560]   Again, in a generally healthy person,
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:49.360]   those risks are so low that they're almost difficult
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:51.560]   to quantify, as evidenced by a recent
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:52.940]   New England Journal of Medicine paper
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:55.540]   that was a very anti-colonoscopy paper,
[01:54:55.540 --> 01:54:59.060]   which I won't get into 'cause it's probably
[01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:00.520]   a little bit of a tangent.
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:02.040]   But what's interesting is, despite being
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:04.380]   a very anti-colonoscopy paper, this paper does
[01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:06.160]   a better job demonstrating the safety
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:07.820]   of colonoscopy than anything else.
[01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:13.840]   It just was an oddly designed experiment.
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:18.840]   So the biggest challenge with aggressive screening posture
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:23.440]   is the specificity problem, which is when you stack
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:26.280]   more and more modalities around these things,
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:28.380]   you're gonna start finding things that aren't cancer.
[01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:32.780]   So MRI has a very high sensitivity.
[01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:35.480]   In English, that just means if a cancer is present,
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:37.360]   an MRI is very likely to see it.
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:43.180]   But it has a very low specificity, which means in English,
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:45.120]   it will see a bunch of things and think
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:47.240]   they are cancer when they are not.
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:51.080]   And it's most troubled by glandular tissue.
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:56.040]   So glandular tissue is the Achilles heel of MRI.
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:58.760]   And therefore, when you use, as we do,
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:01.640]   whole body MRI for cancer screening,
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:05.440]   we tell our patients going in, it's like a 25% chance
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:07.280]   we're gonna find something that is not cancer
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:10.240]   but will require us to do further investigation.
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:12.320]   If you're not cool with that, which is totally fine,
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:14.000]   we probably shouldn't do this.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.560]   And again, most people are okay with that,
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:19.460]   but it helps to set that expectation going in,
[01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:21.740]   that you're gonna probably be chasing your tail,
[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:23.800]   looking at some stupid thyroid nodule
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:25.860]   that is absolutely nothing.
[01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:28.980]   I mean, I can't tell you how many useless thyroid nodules
[01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:30.840]   we've had to get ultrasounds on
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:32.960]   that prove to be absolutely nothing.
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:34.380]   But you have to follow them for a couple of years
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:35.440]   to make sure they're nothing.
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:37.840]   - What is the typical cost of a whole body MRI?
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:39.920]   And so for people who are not your patients,
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:41.340]   how would they go about getting those?
[01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:43.440]   Because I think most people's general practitioner
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:46.360]   is not going to script that out for them.
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:47.200]   - Correct.
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:49.960]   I don't know the short answer
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:51.960]   because I don't know how many different places are doing it.
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:55.720]   I can tell you that we use a couple of different facilities
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:58.500]   and I should disclose that I'm a founder of one of them.
[01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:02.800]   But we use a scanner that probably,
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:08.840]   we send our patients to anywhere they wanna go,
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:11.920]   but within a certain company that we like
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:14.260]   that's not a company I have an affiliation with.
[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:16.960]   And I believe they're charging about $2,500.
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:19.800]   - Since you don't have an affiliation, can you mention that?
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:24.280]   'Cause for instance, you are not my physician, sadly for me.
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:26.700]   And luckily for you.
[01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:29.760]   But I'd love to get a whole body MRI.
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:32.840]   So what is this company?
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:36.300]   - So the company that makes the MRI
[01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:39.360]   that we're using right now is called Pranuvo.
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:43.740]   I interviewed the chief technology officer
[01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:46.220]   and the head radiologist of that company
[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:47.840]   on one of my podcasts.
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:53.240]   It's a super interesting technology based out of Vancouver.
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:57.000]   And for a long time that was the only scanner in the world.
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.360]   So I had my first scan back in 2015.
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:03.900]   I went up to Vancouver to get it done.
[01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:06.560]   I probably had my first two up there.
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:09.640]   They've now opened locations all over the country.
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:12.160]   So they've got one in the Bay Area,
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:14.940]   they've probably got one here in LA.
[01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:17.680]   I know they have one in Dallas.
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:18.880]   So they've got them all over the place.
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:19.720]   - Great.
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:23.440]   - And then the company that I'm affiliated with
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:24.880]   is a different type of company
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:27.080]   that does all sorts of diagnostics.
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:29.560]   But among them is we have a Pranuvo scanner in that company.
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:31.520]   That company's called Biograph and that's in the Bay Area.
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:33.000]   - Biograph. - Biograph, yeah.
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.340]   - Spelled as one would expect. - One word, yep.
[01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:38.880]   - That's very helpful in terms of understanding
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:42.420]   the general risk and ways to offset cancer
[01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:43.960]   to the extent that one can.
[01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:47.060]   And certainly what the consideration should be.
[01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:49.920]   Number three on the list of ways to die.
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:51.820]   We should just title this ways to die.
[01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:53.920]   Or we should title this how not to die.
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:56.140]   Too early.
[01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:59.380]   Neurodegenerative disease.
[01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:02.840]   This is an area I'm somewhat familiar with.
[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:04.960]   Not because of my own experience, thankfully.
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:09.080]   But because of my relationship to the neuroscience community.
[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:10.840]   And last time I checked,
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:16.440]   I was told that everyone experiences
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:19.480]   some age-related cognitive decline.
[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:24.480]   So we all get less proficient at focus memory,
[01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:31.960]   complex context-dependent task switching, all that stuff.
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:33.440]   As we get older.
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:36.320]   But it's the slope of that line
[01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:38.880]   that really can be controlled to some extent.
[01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:41.600]   And that Alzheimer's dementia represents
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:46.600]   just a steep acceleration, downward acceleration
[01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:47.500]   of all of that.
[01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:51.400]   That was what I was told.
[01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:54.160]   I'm guessing that even though I reside in the,
[01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:56.540]   not kind of, but I reside in that community,
[01:59:56.540 --> 01:59:58.380]   that some of that is being revised.
[01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:00.600]   Especially with respect to the underlying causes
[02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:02.840]   of Alzheimer's 'cause there's a lot of controversy,
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:07.840]   even scandal around this whole APP, APOB,
[02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:10.320]   amyloid, plaque, tangle, stuff,
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:12.960]   which is the stuff of textbooks for medical students
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:14.400]   and neuroscience students.
[02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:17.120]   What is the story with neurodegenerative disease,
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:19.200]   Alzheimer's in particular?
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:20.960]   How can we offset it?
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:24.920]   And perhaps as importantly,
[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:28.820]   how can we all slow our own cognitive decline,
[02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:30.960]   irrespective of whether or not we get
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:33.200]   what is called Alzheimer's dementia?
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:38.200]   - So Alzheimer's disease is both the most prevalent
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:41.600]   form of dementia and the most prevalent
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:43.360]   neurodegenerative disease.
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:45.860]   So it occupies that unique spot.
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:49.680]   We're talking about roughly six million people
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:52.160]   in the United States have Alzheimer's disease.
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:56.160]   - That's one in, let's see, I mean.
[02:00:57.400 --> 02:01:00.540]   - About 2% of the total population.
[02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:05.220]   But that doesn't include those with mild cognitive impairment
[02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:08.300]   or pre-dementia or other forms of dementia.
[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:10.960]   And of course, the right metric is not what percent
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:13.560]   of the population, which of course includes children,
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:14.900]   things like that, it's, you know, so.
[02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:17.180]   - That's a function of age, right.
[02:01:17.180 --> 02:01:20.020]   Is age the major risk factor for getting Alzheimer's?
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:22.700]   We say with glaucoma, a disease I'm much more familiar with
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:24.840]   'cause my lab worked on it for many years,
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:27.600]   the biggest risk factor for getting glaucoma is age.
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:30.840]   - Yeah, the greatest risk factor for cardiovascular disease
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:35.160]   is age, the greatest risk factor for cancer is age.
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:37.460]   We tend to not spend a lot of time talking about that
[02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:39.320]   because it's not a modifiable risk.
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:44.620]   So, you know, we tend to focus on modifiable risk factors.
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:49.280]   So what else can we tell you,
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:50.740]   just to give you kind of lay of the land?
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:55.380]   - So the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease
[02:01:55.380 --> 02:01:57.380]   would probably be Lewy body dementia
[02:01:57.380 --> 02:01:59.300]   followed by Parkinson's disease.
[02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:01.980]   Although the rate of growth of Parkinson's disease
[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:04.860]   is the highest, so I think we'd probably be most,
[02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:07.060]   you know, those three diseases we wanna really be paying
[02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:07.900]   a lot of attention to.
[02:02:07.900 --> 02:02:08.740]   As you know, there are a lot
[02:02:08.740 --> 02:02:10.660]   of other neurodegenerative diseases.
[02:02:10.660 --> 02:02:12.540]   Every one of these things is devastating, like--
[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:13.380]   - Multiple sclerosis.
[02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:17.300]   - Yeah, multiple sclerosis, ALS, Huntington's disease.
[02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:19.820]   These are awful, awful diseases.
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:23.140]   There are also other kinds of dementia.
[02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:26.540]   Vascular dementia is not Alzheimer's dementia,
[02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:30.520]   but it is, it produces comparable symptoms.
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:32.060]   Each of these things, by the way, are slightly different.
[02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:33.920]   Lewy body is a dementia.
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:35.700]   It's a dementing disease,
[02:02:35.700 --> 02:02:37.540]   but it also has a movement component.
[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:40.540]   So it sort of sits on a spectrum that's sort of, you know,
[02:02:40.540 --> 02:02:43.580]   I mean, loosely halfway between Alzheimer's disease
[02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:44.860]   and Parkinson's disease.
[02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:48.700]   We talked obviously about age being the number one
[02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:50.460]   risk factor, kind of not that interesting,
[02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:51.580]   'cause you can't do anything about it.
[02:02:51.580 --> 02:02:53.440]   So the real goal is, as we age,
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:55.440]   what are we doing to reduce risk?
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:03:00.340]   Well, let's start with an important gene,
[02:03:00.340 --> 02:03:02.300]   the gene that everybody's heard of.
[02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:05.940]   Certainly came up a lot on the Limitless special
[02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:08.500]   where Chris Hemsworth was, you know,
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:10.340]   made the decision to reveal something
[02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:13.300]   that none of us expected when we started that whole series,
[02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:16.420]   which was that he ended up being homozygous
[02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:19.780]   for the APOE4 isoform.
[02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:24.660]   So maybe folks understand we have two copies of every gene.
[02:03:24.660 --> 02:03:27.920]   So for gene X, you have copy that you got from your mom
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:29.980]   and copy that you got from your dad.
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:33.300]   And the APOE gene is kind of a unique gene
[02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:36.100]   in that it really, it has three different isoforms
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:37.540]   that are all considered normal.
[02:03:37.540 --> 02:03:40.040]   None of them are mutations.
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:43.460]   So you have the E2 isoform, the E3 isoform,
[02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:45.820]   and the E4 isoform.
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:49.180]   The E4 isoform is the OG isoform.
[02:03:49.180 --> 02:03:52.300]   That's the one that we have historically had
[02:03:52.300 --> 02:03:54.860]   as far back as we can go.
[02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:57.260]   We actually think the E4 isoform
[02:03:57.260 --> 02:04:00.180]   offered a lot of advantages back in the day.
[02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:03.780]   It's a bit of a pro-inflammatory isoform,
[02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:07.100]   and it certainly offered protection against infections,
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:09.560]   especially parasitic infections in the CNS,
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:11.460]   which would have been a really important thing
[02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:14.260]   to select for 200,000 years ago.
[02:04:14.260 --> 02:04:16.020]   - How do parasites get into the CNS?
[02:04:16.020 --> 02:04:18.440]   I mean, you got a blood-brain barrier, you got a thick skull.
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:19.580]   I mean, you. - Trauma.
[02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:21.420]   - I'm not telling you you have a thick skull,
[02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:24.620]   but I mean, it just seems like parasites
[02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:26.180]   in other tissues would be an issue,
[02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:27.740]   'cause what we're talking about here is brain disease.
[02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:28.680]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:30.180]   - Anyway, I don't want to take us off course.
[02:04:30.180 --> 02:04:31.320]   - But it also could have protected them.
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:32.740]   It probably offered some protection
[02:04:32.740 --> 02:04:34.140]   outside of the brain as well.
[02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:41.140]   Anyway, the E3 isoform I think showed up,
[02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:45.340]   God, I think 50,000 years ago,
[02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:48.080]   and the E2 isoform showed up very recently,
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:49.500]   about 10,000 years ago.
[02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:55.820]   Now, today, we realize that there's a clear stratification
[02:04:55.820 --> 02:04:59.620]   of risk when it comes to Alzheimer's disease
[02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:01.960]   that tracks with those isoforms.
[02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:04.020]   So because you have two copies,
[02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:05.920]   you basically have six combinations
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:07.260]   of how you can combine those genes.
[02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:10.540]   You could be 2/2, 2/3, 2/4, 3/3, 3/4, 4/4.
[02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:15.660]   The prevalence of them is basically as follows.
[02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:17.660]   3/3 is now the most common.
[02:05:17.660 --> 02:05:18.600]   Three is the most common.
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:23.600]   So double three is 55-ish percent of the population.
[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:25.980]   The next most common is the 3/4,
[02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:28.740]   which is about 25% of the population.
[02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:31.440]   And then after that, most things are kind of a rounding error.
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:36.440]   So 2/3s and 2/4s would be the next most common.
[02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:41.740]   4/4s are very rare, and 2/2s are the rarest of them all.
[02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:43.740]   2/2s are less than 1%.
[02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:45.700]   4/4s are about one to 2%.
[02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:52.620]   Very important point here is that the E4 genes
[02:05:52.620 --> 02:05:53.740]   are not deterministic.
[02:05:53.740 --> 02:05:58.060]   So they're highly associated with the risk,
[02:05:58.060 --> 02:05:58.980]   but they're not deterministic.
[02:05:58.980 --> 02:06:02.560]   There are at least three deterministic genes
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:04.880]   in Alzheimer's disease.
[02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:08.460]   One is called PSEN1, another one is called PSEN2,
[02:06:08.460 --> 02:06:10.020]   and another one is called APP.
[02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:14.860]   Those genes collectively make up about 1% of cases
[02:06:14.860 --> 02:06:16.860]   of people with Alzheimer's disease.
[02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:19.800]   So they're fortunately very rare genes,
[02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:21.640]   but sadly they are deterministic.
[02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:22.820]   Meaning if you have those genes,
[02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:24.680]   you do get Alzheimer's disease.
[02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:27.620]   And what's perhaps most devastating about those genes
[02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:30.780]   is how early the onset is of the disease.
[02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:32.360]   These are people that are usually getting
[02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:34.060]   Alzheimer's disease in their 50s.
[02:06:34.060 --> 02:06:37.820]   So we do have a patient in our practice,
[02:06:37.820 --> 02:06:40.540]   actually she's spoken about this very openly,
[02:06:40.540 --> 02:06:43.420]   whose mom had one of these genes.
[02:06:43.420 --> 02:06:48.420]   And she got Alzheimer's disease in her early 50s,
[02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:52.300]   I think she might have made it into her 60s before she died.
[02:06:52.300 --> 02:06:55.860]   But absolutely devastating consequences here.
[02:06:55.860 --> 02:06:57.740]   - Why do people with Alzheimer's die?
[02:06:57.740 --> 02:06:59.900]   Because I know about the hippocampal degeneration,
[02:06:59.900 --> 02:07:01.480]   hippocampus of course being an area of the brain
[02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:03.560]   important for learning and memory.
[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:05.560]   But is there brainstem degeneration?
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:08.360]   Do they lose breathing centers or cardiovascular control?
[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:10.640]   - Usually what happens is it's sort of failure to thrive,
[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:13.140]   aspiration, things like that.
[02:07:13.140 --> 02:07:15.780]   So it's usually they just stop eating.
[02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:18.340]   Or they can't control secretions,
[02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:20.300]   they aspirate, they get a pneumonia.
[02:07:20.300 --> 02:07:25.100]   Or they really lose the ability to even sense pain
[02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:28.060]   in their body and therefore they'll get an ulcer
[02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:30.080]   and they don't realize it and it'll become cellulitic
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:33.460]   and they'll develop a horrible infection in response to it.
[02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:35.100]   - I see, so it's a body vulnerability.
[02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:36.800]   The reason I ask is every once in a while
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:40.660]   a news report will come out based on a legitimate case study
[02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:44.380]   where they'll do a scan on some person
[02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:46.540]   and discover that they're missing literally
[02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:49.100]   half their cerebral cortex, like huge chunks of brain
[02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:50.900]   and they're functioning relatively normally.
[02:07:50.900 --> 02:07:52.860]   And so here we're talking about a neurodegenerative disease
[02:07:52.860 --> 02:07:56.400]   of relatively, it's widespread but there are a few hotspots
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:58.700]   of course in the brain that degenerate more profoundly
[02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:00.280]   than others and the people dying.
[02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:01.120]   So that makes sense.
[02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:04.220]   It extends to lack of peripheral awareness or control
[02:08:04.220 --> 02:08:06.720]   and then some acute injury or infection.
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:07.560]   Got it.
[02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:11.120]   - You mentioned earlier some of the controversy, right?
[02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:12.560]   So what are we talking about here?
[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:16.460]   Well, it's, and I do write about this at length
[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:18.040]   in the chapter on Alzheimer's disease
[02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:21.200]   because I think this is a very important point, right?
[02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:25.800]   Which is the index case for Alzheimer's disease,
[02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:27.000]   there's always an index case, right?
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:30.120]   You know, there's the quote unquote patient zero.
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:35.120]   The index case was a woman who 100 years later
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:39.100]   we realized had an APP mutation.
[02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:40.700]   These are APP or PSEN1.
[02:08:40.700 --> 02:08:43.120]   But she had one of these deterministic genes
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:45.600]   that led to a very early onset of disease,
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:48.860]   which by the way, without which we may not have come up
[02:08:48.860 --> 02:08:51.420]   with the diagnosis because had she just got
[02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:53.500]   Alzheimer's disease in her 70s,
[02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:55.400]   it would have just been referred to as senility,
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:58.420]   which is, you know, was not interesting enough
[02:08:58.420 --> 02:08:59.420]   to pay attention to.
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:05.000]   But I think it probably set the field on the path
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.360]   towards an overemphasis on amyloid beta.
[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:15.860]   And it's not really clear how important amyloid is,
[02:09:15.860 --> 02:09:21.040]   which is not to say it's not important, it is important.
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:25.840]   And there's no ambiguity that amyloid is responsible
[02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:30.340]   for the changes that we see in the brain.
[02:09:30.340 --> 02:09:32.900]   But it's not crystal clear because there are lots
[02:09:32.900 --> 02:09:35.620]   of autopsies that are done on people
[02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:37.660]   that are completely healthy and have died
[02:09:37.660 --> 02:09:39.960]   with no cognitive impairment
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:42.340]   and they're chock full of amyloid.
[02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:47.340]   So what we don't fully understand is exactly
[02:09:47.340 --> 02:09:50.140]   what does removing amyloid do.
[02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:52.800]   The other thing that complicates the story
[02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:56.780]   is there has been no shortage of drugs that target amyloid
[02:09:56.780 --> 02:09:58.700]   that have seemed unsuccessful.
[02:09:58.700 --> 02:10:01.460]   - And just to clarify, when you say amyloid,
[02:10:01.460 --> 02:10:04.900]   you mean people have died with their brains examined
[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:06.240]   in autopsy and see that there are tons
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:07.780]   of so-called amyloid plaques?
[02:10:07.780 --> 02:10:08.820]   - Correct.
[02:10:08.820 --> 02:10:11.380]   - Different than arterial plaques, of course,
[02:10:11.380 --> 02:10:13.620]   but within the brain so that the two hallmarks
[02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:16.420]   of Alzheimer's histopathologically
[02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:18.560]   would be plaques and tangles.
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:23.040]   And even that now is, of course, coming under question.
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:26.940]   But it's what we teach every neuroscience graduate student,
[02:10:26.940 --> 02:10:28.100]   it's what we teach every undergraduate,
[02:10:28.100 --> 02:10:30.580]   it's also what we teach every medical student,
[02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:33.260]   and not just at Stanford, but everywhere.
[02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:36.260]   So I have heard that the link between APP
[02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:39.960]   and whether or not one develops genes related to APP,
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:42.680]   and whether or not it's cleaved at one side or another,
[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:43.740]   which is what you were describing,
[02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:45.060]   and risk for Alzheimer's.
[02:10:45.060 --> 02:10:47.520]   - Yeah, so it's basically a cleavage question, right?
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:49.900]   So APP, people with the APP mutation,
[02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:51.820]   I think have one extra cleavage site.
[02:10:51.820 --> 02:10:55.860]   They result in one extra cleavage of amyloid,
[02:10:55.860 --> 02:10:57.340]   and then it misfolds.
[02:10:57.340 --> 02:11:00.820]   And the misfolding is what the plaque is that's being created
[02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:02.500]   that also then predisposes them
[02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:07.500]   to the neurofibrillary tangles, and again.
[02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:09.700]   - But all this is under question now, right?
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:12.060]   I mean, this is what I was told, and when I look,
[02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:14.820]   it sounds like there were some papers early
[02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:18.680]   in the chain of discovery and the research in Alzheimer's
[02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:23.040]   that were either wrong because they were falsified,
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:23.880]   intentionally falsified.
[02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:25.720]   - There was an intentionally falsified paper
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:29.720]   on one particular amyloid variant,
[02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:32.460]   and that clearly set the field back a decade,
[02:11:32.460 --> 02:11:34.400]   because a lot of people went down that rabbit hole
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:36.940]   based on deliberately falsified data.
[02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:40.120]   - So what happened to that guy?
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:41.160]   I don't know why I assume it was a guy,
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:42.320]   but what happened to that guy?
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:44.480]   - Yeah, it's a good question.
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:47.700]   I think I wrote one piece about it when it happened.
[02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:50.660]   I actually reached out to the person who broke the story,
[02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:52.660]   'cause I wanted to have them on my podcast,
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:55.400]   and I forget why he didn't do it.
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:57.400]   I forget why he wouldn't commit to it
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:11:58.920]   or something like that, but I thought it was a little odd,
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:01.020]   'cause I thought this would be a great way
[02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:01.980]   to talk about this.
[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:06.260]   I do not know what came of that scandal.
[02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:08.040]   In other words, I haven't paid attention to it
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:11.280]   for probably nine months, so I don't know.
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:13.080]   Obviously, the paper's probably been recalled,
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:15.900]   but I don't know what disciplinary action was taken.
[02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:22.460]   The field is, I don't know.
[02:12:22.460 --> 02:12:24.920]   I don't wanna speak like I'm in the field, because I'm not,
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:27.400]   so I wanna be careful what I say,
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:32.400]   but I think the field is probably in a bit of a crisis,
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:37.240]   because there have been so many bets
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:42.160]   placed on anti-amyloid therapies and amyloid biomarkers
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:47.160]   and amyloid everything, and we just haven't seen efficacy.
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:49.880]   Contrast that with cardiovascular disease,
[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:54.060]   where you have this ApoB biomarker,
[02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:57.640]   you understand the pathophysiology of how it works,
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:01.960]   you have drugs that target it, so you have a biomarker,
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:04.160]   so you give somebody a drug that lowers ApoB,
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:05.320]   you can measure ApoB.
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:07.180]   That's a really important and obvious thing
[02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:09.880]   to be able to do, and then you have clinical outcomes,
[02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:12.560]   which is, oh, when you take a bunch of people in primary
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:15.440]   prevention, it takes this long before you see an effect.
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:17.440]   In secondary prevention, it only takes this long
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:18.780]   to see an effect, right?
[02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:21.320]   Different risk stratifications, all these different things.
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:24.060]   We don't have any of that for Alzheimer's disease.
[02:13:24.060 --> 02:13:27.480]   So we do use, there are now serum amyloid biomarkers
[02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:29.160]   that we use, and we do track these
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:33.680]   in our highest-risk patients, but only because we believe,
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:35.520]   and I don't know if we're right, by the way,
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:38.420]   that lower is better, and therefore,
[02:13:38.420 --> 02:13:40.660]   if we make these changes to you,
[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:43.660]   and your serum amyloid levels come down,
[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:45.500]   that that tells us something about what's happening
[02:13:45.500 --> 02:13:47.140]   in your brain that's favorable.
[02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:50.220]   But I mean, I would hate to represent
[02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:52.540]   that we are practicing nearly the level
[02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:55.880]   of precision medicine there that we are
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:58.080]   in cardiovascular medicine.
[02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:00.720]   When it comes to Alzheimer's disease,
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:01.720]   maybe take a step back.
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:05.160]   When it comes to brain health, I think there are a handful
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:09.000]   of things that seem unequivocally true,
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.740]   and there's a lot of stuff that is signal-to-noise ratio
[02:14:13.740 --> 02:14:14.960]   that's really low.
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:17.600]   So the unequivocally true things
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:21.020]   for brain health are sleep matters.
[02:14:21.020 --> 02:14:25.800]   Another unequivocally true thing for brain health
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:30.340]   is that lower LDL cholesterol and ApoB is better than higher.
[02:14:30.340 --> 02:14:33.800]   Another thing that is unequivocally true
[02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:36.820]   is not having type 2 diabetes matters.
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:40.000]   - So having really good-- - Being in, yeah, but--
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.660]   - Be insulin-sensitive, not-- - Being insulin-sensitive
[02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:46.840]   matters, sleeping adequately matters,
[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:49.760]   having lower lipids matters.
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:53.620]   Those three things are clear, and the fourth one
[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:57.280]   that is unequivocally clear is exercise matters.
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:14:58.340]   More exercise-- - In a specific form
[02:14:58.340 --> 02:14:59.520]   of exercise?
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:02.460]   - Very, I mean, so I tried to answer this question
[02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:05.920]   in a recent AMA that I did, 'cause the answer is
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:09.020]   more is always better, but if you,
[02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:12.300]   if I tried to have one of our analysts look at it
[02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:14.140]   through the lens of if you could only exercise
[02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:17.500]   three hours a week, what would be the highest use case?
[02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:21.020]   And our interpretation of the literature was
[02:15:21.020 --> 02:15:24.180]   if you could only spend three hours a week exercising,
[02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:28.820]   you'd be best off doing one hour of low-intensity cardio,
[02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:31.940]   one hour of strength, and one hour of interval training.
[02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:35.980]   So if someone said I only want the minimum effective dose,
[02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:37.540]   you're gonna get a pretty good bang for your buck
[02:15:37.540 --> 02:15:40.060]   doing that, but I would argue if your brain
[02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:41.660]   really matters to you, do more.
[02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:43.500]   - One hour of interval training's no joke.
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:44.780]   - No, 'cause you're gonna spread that out
[02:15:44.780 --> 02:15:47.180]   over probably at least two workouts, yeah.
[02:15:47.180 --> 02:15:50.300]   But Andrew, those four things are basically
[02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:55.180]   the only thing where there's no ambiguity about the benefit.
[02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:58.060]   - What about head hits, like don't hit your head?
[02:15:58.060 --> 02:16:01.540]   - Seems almost assuredly true in a susceptible individual
[02:16:01.540 --> 02:16:02.460]   for sure.
[02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:06.860]   So I put that, yeah, maybe we could include that as well.
[02:16:06.860 --> 02:16:08.980]   - Well I just want to, one of the things I've been learning
[02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:13.300]   recently is I know you boxed for a number of years
[02:16:13.300 --> 02:16:15.980]   when you were younger, I boxed a little bit,
[02:16:15.980 --> 02:16:17.460]   hit my head a number of times skateboarding,
[02:16:17.460 --> 02:16:20.180]   but we think about sports injuries as the major cause
[02:16:20.180 --> 02:16:22.060]   of head injuries, but then I've got colleagues
[02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:22.900]   at Stanford that say-- - You have a car accident
[02:16:22.900 --> 02:16:24.260]   that's horrible. - Car accidents,
[02:16:24.260 --> 02:16:27.740]   bike accidents, I've got so many colleagues
[02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:31.220]   and children of colleagues growing up in and around campus
[02:16:31.220 --> 02:16:34.140]   that were hit by cars on Woodside Road,
[02:16:34.140 --> 02:16:37.580]   or a mere small object surrounded by three,
[02:16:37.580 --> 02:16:39.500]   was it a car weight, 3,000 pounds or something like that?
[02:16:39.500 --> 02:16:40.900]   - Jack Moore, yeah.
[02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:43.780]   - It's unbelievable the number of head injuries
[02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:45.180]   and then construction sites,
[02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:46.700]   'cause those ridiculous little hard hats
[02:16:46.700 --> 02:16:50.580]   which don't protect against anything except, I don't know,
[02:16:50.580 --> 02:16:54.600]   maybe a windblown hair that they basically predisposed,
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:56.660]   the whole situation predisposed people to head injuries,
[02:16:56.660 --> 02:16:58.460]   very common on construction sites.
[02:16:58.460 --> 02:17:01.460]   And then say nothing of military, et cetera.
[02:17:01.460 --> 02:17:05.420]   So I think that I was told that the best thing to do
[02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:08.780]   if you get a head injury is to not get another one.
[02:17:08.780 --> 02:17:11.800]   In other words, if you can, stop doing the activity
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:13.260]   that leads to more head injury.
[02:17:13.260 --> 02:17:15.780]   - Yeah, the other thing that I think is emerging
[02:17:15.780 --> 02:17:18.140]   and I hope it is studied rigorously
[02:17:18.140 --> 02:17:20.380]   is the use of hyperbaric oxygen
[02:17:20.380 --> 02:17:24.140]   immediately following a TBI, a traumatic brain injury.
[02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:27.380]   I reached out to Dom D'Agostino a little while ago
[02:17:27.380 --> 02:17:29.540]   'cause he knows a lot about this lit,
[02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:32.040]   to say, "Hey, is there anything out there
[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:34.620]   that's really kind of turnkey convincing?"
[02:17:34.620 --> 02:17:35.820]   And he said, "Not yet."
[02:17:35.820 --> 02:17:38.340]   They're still doing it, right?
[02:17:38.340 --> 02:17:40.580]   So I would do this.
[02:17:40.580 --> 02:17:42.300]   If I was in a car accident tomorrow
[02:17:42.300 --> 02:17:43.900]   and sustained a concussion,
[02:17:43.900 --> 02:17:46.220]   and by the way, I'm not a proponent of hyperbaric oxygen.
[02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:48.220]   So we have an internal white paper
[02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:50.780]   that we wrote inside quite recently
[02:17:50.780 --> 02:17:53.900]   where I examined, when I say I examined,
[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:58.500]   the analyst team examined and I pushed back and reviewed.
[02:17:58.500 --> 02:18:03.060]   And I came away very kind of bearish on hyperbaric oxygen.
[02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:04.940]   I don't think it's harmful,
[02:18:04.940 --> 02:18:07.620]   but I think all of the claims are nonsense.
[02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:09.740]   Telomere extension is totally irrelevant.
[02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:11.200]   And if you actually look at the studies,
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:13.860]   they're the worst done studies I've ever seen in my life.
[02:18:13.860 --> 02:18:15.620]   I'm sure you've seen some of these where it's like,
[02:18:15.620 --> 02:18:17.040]   you put these people in a hyperbaric chamber
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:18.560]   and then watch them do cognitive tasks,
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:19.900]   act after and they're so much better.
[02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:21.200]   Well, the fine print is
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:23.060]   they don't even have placebo groups here.
[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:26.020]   Like, can you imagine doing a study without a placebo group
[02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:29.180]   or your placebo group doesn't go into a sham chamber?
[02:18:29.180 --> 02:18:30.540]   - Yeah, I mean, one of the big problems
[02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:33.660]   of the proliferation of all these pay-to-play journals,
[02:18:33.660 --> 02:18:36.040]   meaning journals that will basically publish a paper
[02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:39.000]   with minimal or poor peer review
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.340]   because they charge in order to publish
[02:18:41.340 --> 02:18:43.340]   and then offer free access.
[02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:44.420]   Free access sounds great,
[02:18:44.420 --> 02:18:46.180]   but when it's pay-to-play type journals,
[02:18:46.180 --> 02:18:48.200]   there's been a huge proliferation of papers,
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:49.900]   most of which you find on Twitter,
[02:18:51.260 --> 02:18:54.720]   in which the study design is beyond that.
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:18:58.460]   Like a ninth grader who woke up late for school
[02:18:58.460 --> 02:19:01.540]   and was partying all weekend could design a better study
[02:19:01.540 --> 02:19:03.260]   than most of these studies.
[02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:04.980]   And there's some excellent studies out there as well,
[02:19:04.980 --> 02:19:07.020]   of course, presumably and eventually
[02:19:07.020 --> 02:19:08.260]   on hyperbaric chamber too.
[02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:10.180]   So I'm not picking on hyperbaric chamber per se,
[02:19:10.180 --> 02:19:14.500]   but the proliferation of truly terrible science
[02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:17.260]   that's published in peer reviewed journals
[02:19:17.260 --> 02:19:19.060]   is just overwhelming.
[02:19:19.060 --> 02:19:20.300]   - Yeah, it's insane.
[02:19:20.300 --> 02:19:21.940]   And all of that is to say,
[02:19:21.940 --> 02:19:24.500]   I think there are places where hyperbaric oxygen
[02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:26.720]   makes sense, clearly in wound healing it does.
[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:29.700]   It's a miracle treatment for wound healing.
[02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:33.660]   And I would absolutely use hyperbaric oxygen
[02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:35.020]   if I suffered a concussion.
[02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:38.620]   But beyond that, I think it's pretty tough
[02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:39.460]   to make the case.
[02:19:39.460 --> 02:19:40.660]   - Where do people go for that?
[02:19:40.660 --> 02:19:42.380]   I mean, their clinics?
[02:19:42.380 --> 02:19:44.300]   - Yeah, the clinics you basically go to.
[02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:45.940]   - 'Cause the protocols have to be very precise.
[02:19:45.940 --> 02:19:48.480]   I mean, this isn't something to cowboy at home.
[02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:51.300]   - No, no, no, you have to go into a real chamber.
[02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:55.840]   I think the TBI protocol that's most commonly used
[02:19:55.840 --> 02:19:58.980]   is, God, I wanna say it's pretty intense.
[02:19:58.980 --> 02:20:02.460]   It's like five 60 minute sessions a week
[02:20:02.460 --> 02:20:03.560]   at two atmospheres.
[02:20:03.560 --> 02:20:04.400]   - Oh boy.
[02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:05.840]   - Like it's no joke.
[02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:08.900]   So from a cost and time perspective, it's enormous.
[02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:12.340]   And the time and cost are reasons why I think
[02:20:12.340 --> 02:20:14.140]   when I see people doing hyperbaric oxygen
[02:20:14.140 --> 02:20:16.740]   just because they think it's gonna help them live longer,
[02:20:16.740 --> 02:20:19.740]   I'm like, dude, you know what you could do
[02:20:19.740 --> 02:20:22.140]   with five hours a week plus the commuting time
[02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:23.260]   that you put into that?
[02:20:23.260 --> 02:20:27.460]   Put that into exercise and I promise you
[02:20:27.460 --> 02:20:28.780]   you'll get a bigger benefit
[02:20:28.780 --> 02:20:31.640]   than you're getting out of hyperbaric oxygen.
[02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:34.520]   But there's a lot of other stuff that I just think
[02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:37.720]   is maybe helpful.
[02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:39.500]   There's tons of supplements that I think about
[02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:41.180]   when it comes to brain health.
[02:20:41.180 --> 02:20:42.180]   What about therecumin?
[02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:46.120]   What about magnesium with L-threonate, the transporter?
[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:49.060]   What about methylated vitamins that lower homocysteine?
[02:20:49.060 --> 02:20:51.160]   What about EPA and DHA?
[02:20:51.160 --> 02:20:53.520]   And we've gone through all of the literature on that stuff
[02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:55.940]   and many of these things we still are recommending
[02:20:55.940 --> 02:21:00.160]   through a kind of basically like the potential benefits
[02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:02.120]   outweigh the potential costs.
[02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:04.860]   But the evidence is really unimpressive
[02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:06.280]   for most of those other interventions.
[02:21:06.280 --> 02:21:08.260]   So when you think about the big four or big five
[02:21:08.260 --> 02:21:10.520]   if you include not getting head injury,
[02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:13.280]   everything else is probably a rounding error
[02:21:13.280 --> 02:21:15.280]   compared to those big ones.
[02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:17.900]   - Maybe just for sake of thoroughness
[02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:19.300]   we can just list off those four again.
[02:21:19.300 --> 02:21:20.140]   Exercise.
[02:21:20.140 --> 02:21:25.140]   - Exercise, sleep, insulin sensitivity and lipid management.
[02:21:25.140 --> 02:21:29.060]   - Well along the lines of head injuries
[02:21:29.060 --> 02:21:30.620]   we should probably move to the next category
[02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:35.540]   of how not to die is to avoid accidental death.
[02:21:35.540 --> 02:21:38.860]   How common is accidental death
[02:21:38.860 --> 02:21:40.580]   and what are these accidental deaths?
[02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:43.740]   Because we are separating this out from automotive death.
[02:21:43.740 --> 02:21:46.220]   So is this people falling while hiking,
[02:21:46.220 --> 02:21:50.920]   selfies gone bad, you know what are we talking about here?
[02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:52.500]   I'm not chuckling because I like it.
[02:21:52.500 --> 02:21:55.180]   It's just I mean it seems like there's a near infinite
[02:21:55.180 --> 02:21:57.880]   ways to die accidentally.
[02:21:57.880 --> 02:22:02.980]   - So I think there's two ways to kind of look at this.
[02:22:02.980 --> 02:22:06.800]   And so here I kind of merge two categories.
[02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:12.660]   So I would call it that overlap in the way
[02:22:12.660 --> 02:22:14.660]   that they're characterized by the CDC
[02:22:14.660 --> 02:22:17.180]   but I would sort of, we'll talk about them separately
[02:22:17.180 --> 02:22:18.020]   and bring them together.
[02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:21.680]   So if you talk about true accidental deaths,
[02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:26.680]   automotive and falls and overdoses are the three.
[02:22:26.680 --> 02:22:30.260]   That's basically what it comes down to.
[02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:33.220]   So you know in our death bar analysis
[02:22:33.220 --> 02:22:34.340]   we kind of list all the stuff out.
[02:22:34.340 --> 02:22:35.780]   In fact I think that's actually one of the figures
[02:22:35.780 --> 02:22:39.620]   in the book is I have the accidental death figure
[02:22:39.620 --> 02:22:43.700]   that we've put together where we've adjusted by population.
[02:22:43.700 --> 02:22:45.460]   And you'll see a couple of things.
[02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:48.460]   If you look at it in absolute terms,
[02:22:48.460 --> 02:22:50.940]   it's basically a pretty constant.
[02:22:50.940 --> 02:22:53.220]   So regardless of what decade of life you're in,
[02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:57.500]   once you're above 20, accidental deaths
[02:22:57.500 --> 02:22:59.880]   are a pretty sizable number of deaths.
[02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:02.760]   Now car accidents seem to be pretty constant
[02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:06.380]   throughout life, little more common if you're under 60
[02:23:06.380 --> 02:23:09.420]   than over 60 but they never go away.
[02:23:09.420 --> 02:23:14.420]   - I was told that in teenage and boys in their early 20s,
[02:23:14.420 --> 02:23:19.500]   alcohol induced automotive fatalities
[02:23:19.500 --> 02:23:22.180]   place them at an astronomic risk.
[02:23:22.180 --> 02:23:23.620]   Is that just not true?
[02:23:23.620 --> 02:23:26.420]   - It's not true anymore compared to overdoses.
[02:23:26.420 --> 02:23:27.980]   - Is that because young people now
[02:23:27.980 --> 02:23:29.380]   aren't getting their driver's licenses?
[02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:30.220]   I've also heard that.
[02:23:30.220 --> 02:23:32.180]   - Yeah well I think it's also because we're seeing
[02:23:32.180 --> 02:23:35.840]   such an uptick in the deaths that come from fentanyl.
[02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:40.920]   So fentanyl related deaths have basically squashed
[02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:43.860]   all other deaths below 65 on the accidental front.
[02:23:43.860 --> 02:23:45.920]   - Really?
[02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:47.380]   - Oh yeah but it's not even close.
[02:23:47.380 --> 02:23:49.740]   - Because of the number of different substances
[02:23:49.740 --> 02:23:51.060]   that fentanyl is being woven into.
[02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:53.460]   - It's winding its way into everything.
[02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:56.460]   So all counterfeit drugs, all illicit drugs.
[02:23:56.460 --> 02:23:58.620]   And look, most of the time you're not getting a lethal dose
[02:23:58.620 --> 02:24:02.740]   so it's you know, but you're getting lethal doses
[02:24:02.740 --> 02:24:07.740]   so often now that, well you know I did a little analysis
[02:24:07.740 --> 02:24:12.160]   actually the other day when I looked at how are deaths
[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:15.720]   of despair increasing over the last five years.
[02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:18.340]   So what did I define as a death of despair?
[02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:22.700]   Suicide, alcohol related death, or overdose.
[02:24:22.700 --> 02:24:23.620]   Accidental overdose.
[02:24:23.620 --> 02:24:26.080]   So we differentiate that from suicide
[02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:27.900]   where suicide is obviously deliberate
[02:24:27.900 --> 02:24:29.540]   and accidental is not.
[02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:30.860]   So if you just look at those three things.
[02:24:30.860 --> 02:24:35.220]   So accidental overdoses, suicides, and alcohol use
[02:24:35.220 --> 02:24:36.480]   or alcohol related death.
[02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:41.100]   Not including driving by the way.
[02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:44.020]   This is like cirrhosis of the liver that comes from.
[02:24:44.020 --> 02:24:49.020]   That number is going up at almost 20% per year since 2019.
[02:24:49.020 --> 02:24:53.420]   So I couldn't get 2022 numbers yet.
[02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:56.560]   So at the time I did this analysis which was last week,
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:04.400]   the 2021 numbers was about 210,000 Americans.
[02:25:04.400 --> 02:25:06.260]   - Goodness.
[02:25:06.260 --> 02:25:11.260]   - Up from 180,000 in 2020, up from like 150,000 in 2019.
[02:25:11.260 --> 02:25:21.980]   And that is driven almost entirely by fentanyl use.
[02:25:21.980 --> 02:25:24.260]   - So I'm trying to get a sense of how this would happen.
[02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:26.660]   A while back there was an article in the New York Times
[02:25:26.660 --> 02:25:31.660]   that some photographs of people that died
[02:25:31.660 --> 02:25:35.120]   of fentanyl overdose and said they went out to buy cocaine
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:35.960]   and died of fentanyl.
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:39.040]   And I thought to myself, this is a really kind of odd
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:42.120]   socio-biological phenomenon, right?
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:45.340]   Because I mean, here they're not demonizing
[02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:46.260]   these cocaine users.
[02:25:46.260 --> 02:25:47.980]   I mean, they went out to buy cocaine, right?
[02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:51.660]   This is not a, I know cocaine has one narrow clinical use
[02:25:51.660 --> 02:25:52.640]   as a prescription drug.
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:54.100]   But in general, when people buy cocaine,
[02:25:54.100 --> 02:25:55.820]   they're quote unquote partying with it
[02:25:55.820 --> 02:25:59.180]   or using it to work longer hours or something like that.
[02:25:59.180 --> 02:26:01.580]   So the whole nature of the article was a bit strange to me,
[02:26:01.580 --> 02:26:05.460]   but it clearly pointed to the fact
[02:26:05.460 --> 02:26:08.660]   that people are using cocaine, okay, that's no surprise.
[02:26:08.660 --> 02:26:11.700]   But people are going out and buying cocaine.
[02:26:11.700 --> 02:26:13.160]   They're presumably buying Valium.
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:14.000]   They're presumably buying-
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.980]   - Yeah, this is where it's really killing kids.
[02:26:15.980 --> 02:26:18.580]   - I mean, but this is online, this is in person.
[02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:21.700]   I mean, the reason I'm so baffled by this is,
[02:26:21.700 --> 02:26:25.440]   let me contextualize what I've said so far
[02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:27.000]   about this question.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:30.160]   I was surprised that the Times would write a paper
[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:34.780]   about the tragedy of cocaine users dying of fentanyl.
[02:26:34.780 --> 02:26:38.160]   And I think they did it to highlight this fentanyl problem
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:41.160]   because people have been using cocaine for a long time.
[02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:43.920]   And typically those are not the members of the population
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:46.480]   that we're really focused on since the mid '80s,
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:49.140]   the so-called cocaine and crack epidemic.
[02:26:49.140 --> 02:26:52.560]   So basically it tells me that people, like you said,
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:56.740]   illicit drugs, so cocaine, but also,
[02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:58.580]   what other sorts of drugs are people buying?
[02:26:58.580 --> 02:27:00.240]   - So where the majority of people are dying
[02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:02.620]   from fentanyl poisoning.
[02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:04.160]   And I had a guy on my podcast recently
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:05.300]   named Anthony Hippolito.
[02:27:05.300 --> 02:27:06.740]   And if anybody's interested in this topic,
[02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:08.140]   they really need to go listen to that.
[02:27:08.140 --> 02:27:08.980]   So Anthony-
[02:27:08.980 --> 02:27:10.300]   - I watched the YouTube version of this
[02:27:10.300 --> 02:27:11.900]   and your podcasts are excellent.
[02:27:11.900 --> 02:27:13.240]   So if you're interested in this,
[02:27:13.240 --> 02:27:14.900]   and I think everyone should be interested in this.
[02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:18.000]   - If you have a child or know somebody who has a child,
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.200]   you just got to get this podcast into their hands
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:22.960]   because it's the most important public service announcement
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:24.200]   I'll probably ever do
[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:26.760]   in terms of saving more lives potentially.
[02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:30.600]   Where the majority of this is making its way
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:33.880]   into the accidental poisonings
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:36.640]   is through illicit counterfeit pills.
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:40.180]   So it's when kids are out there buying, you know,
[02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:41.500]   Oxy, they want Oxy.
[02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:43.360]   Well, they can't get real Oxy, right?
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:45.700]   'Cause they're not gonna go to a doctor and get real Oxy.
[02:27:45.700 --> 02:27:48.560]   So they're gonna buy it through, you know, Snapchat, right?
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:49.940]   They're gonna buy it through some drug dealer
[02:27:49.940 --> 02:27:52.140]   that they're finding on social media.
[02:27:52.140 --> 02:27:54.140]   They're buying sleeping pills.
[02:27:54.140 --> 02:27:58.080]   They're buying all sorts of counterfeit stuff like Adderall.
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:00.860]   Any of these things are being laced with fentanyl.
[02:28:00.860 --> 02:28:01.700]   - Adderall.
[02:28:01.700 --> 02:28:03.340]   - Absolutely.
[02:28:03.340 --> 02:28:04.940]   - Well, I assume the fentanyl-
[02:28:04.940 --> 02:28:07.740]   - And again, the reasons are it's insanely cheap
[02:28:07.740 --> 02:28:09.720]   to use synthetic fentanyl.
[02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:11.360]   And secondly, and again-
[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:12.920]   - But the effects of fentanyl are nothing like
[02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:14.040]   the effects of Adderall.
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:16.500]   So cocaine doesn't make sense for that reason either.
[02:28:16.500 --> 02:28:17.720]   - Cocaine doesn't make sense either.
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:19.820]   Yep, and yet it's still showing up in cocaine.
[02:28:19.820 --> 02:28:22.360]   Again, I don't think that's the dominant place
[02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:23.200]   it's showing up.
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:26.940]   I would guess that the dominant place it's showing up
[02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:30.100]   is in counterfeit opioids.
[02:28:30.100 --> 02:28:33.500]   - So any opioid, barbiturate, any sedative, depressant.
[02:28:33.500 --> 02:28:35.460]   - Let me tell you what I'm telling my daughter, right?
[02:28:35.460 --> 02:28:37.020]   'Cause this is, to me, it's a frontline problem.
[02:28:37.020 --> 02:28:38.580]   I have a 14-year-old daughter.
[02:28:38.580 --> 02:28:41.420]   I'm like, listen, I don't care which friend of yours it is.
[02:28:41.420 --> 02:28:43.560]   I don't care how much she's amazing.
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:46.480]   If she tells you to try this sleeping pill
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:47.860]   because she took it the night before
[02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:49.180]   and it was really helpful,
[02:28:49.180 --> 02:28:50.660]   or this will help you study better,
[02:28:50.660 --> 02:28:52.200]   or this will help you do anything,
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:53.860]   I'm like, just come to us.
[02:28:53.860 --> 02:28:55.920]   We've got a better pill for you, right?
[02:28:55.920 --> 02:28:59.260]   Like in other words, you can't trust anything
[02:28:59.260 --> 02:29:00.620]   'cause you don't know where she got it.
[02:29:00.620 --> 02:29:02.100]   She has the best of intentions, I'm sure,
[02:29:02.100 --> 02:29:02.940]   when she's giving it to you.
[02:29:02.940 --> 02:29:04.440]   And by the way, she probably took it the night before
[02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:05.760]   and was just fine.
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:08.760]   But the people who are making these pills
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:11.580]   are not exactly up to GMP standards.
[02:29:11.580 --> 02:29:14.540]   So you just have no idea
[02:29:14.540 --> 02:29:17.300]   which pill is getting what dose of fentanyl.
[02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:18.760]   One thing that Anthony Hippolito told me
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:19.780]   that I simply couldn't believe,
[02:29:19.780 --> 02:29:21.520]   I had to ask him six times,
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:23.260]   was that some of these pills
[02:29:23.260 --> 02:29:27.340]   have like one milligram of fentanyl in them.
[02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:29.640]   Now, I made the point on the podcast
[02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:33.380]   that 100 milligrams of fentanyl, for most people,
[02:29:33.380 --> 02:29:36.640]   is a hit, like I've had fentanyl before,
[02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:38.380]   I've been in the hospital and I've had fentanyl.
[02:29:38.380 --> 02:29:43.300]   100 milligrams is like, wow, that is such a trip.
[02:29:43.300 --> 02:29:45.660]   - Why are people dying from one milligram intake?
[02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:48.140]   - Respiratory inhibition, you can't breathe.
[02:29:48.140 --> 02:29:49.980]   That shuts the brain stem off.
[02:29:49.980 --> 02:29:52.900]   - Well, I don't think we can highlight this enough.
[02:29:52.900 --> 02:29:54.100]   Adults are dying, kids are dying.
[02:29:54.100 --> 02:29:56.100]   I met someone just earlier this week
[02:29:56.100 --> 02:29:57.900]   who told me her 35-year-old son died
[02:29:57.900 --> 02:29:59.640]   of an accidental fentanyl overdose.
[02:29:59.640 --> 02:30:02.660]   And he wasn't, at least by her description,
[02:30:02.660 --> 02:30:04.260]   a drug addict or anything of that sort.
[02:30:04.260 --> 02:30:06.940]   - Yeah, we're talking about a different game now, right?
[02:30:06.940 --> 02:30:09.200]   So it's like, these are kids that have anxiety.
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:14.200]   These are kids that are sort of addressing another issue
[02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:15.660]   with these pills.
[02:30:15.660 --> 02:30:17.520]   And that's why I think this whole concept
[02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:21.020]   of deaths of despair is a really important one.
[02:30:21.020 --> 02:30:23.900]   But back to your question, what do accidental deaths
[02:30:23.900 --> 02:30:28.900]   primarily amount to for the aging population?
[02:30:28.900 --> 02:30:33.100]   Again, it is so clear that it is fall related.
[02:30:33.100 --> 02:30:38.100]   This is where once you hit 60, 65,
[02:30:38.100 --> 02:30:42.900]   the risk of a fall that results either immediately in death,
[02:30:42.900 --> 02:30:44.900]   you know, you hit your head and die,
[02:30:44.900 --> 02:30:46.920]   going back to like cerebral hemorrhage,
[02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:51.620]   or it is the straw that basically leads you down the path
[02:30:51.620 --> 02:30:55.420]   to death within the next 12 months is astonishingly high.
[02:30:55.420 --> 02:30:57.900]   It's so high that it's sort of hard
[02:30:57.900 --> 02:30:58.740]   to wrap your head around.
[02:30:58.740 --> 02:31:02.020]   But if you're over 65 and you fall
[02:31:02.020 --> 02:31:05.420]   and break your femur or hip,
[02:31:05.420 --> 02:31:08.580]   so you either crack the femoral neck or the femur itself,
[02:31:08.580 --> 02:31:13.660]   your 12-month mortality, the probability you will be dead
[02:31:13.660 --> 02:31:17.080]   in 12 months after that break, if you're 65 or older,
[02:31:17.080 --> 02:31:20.640]   depending on the study, is about 15 to 30%.
[02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:22.240]   - Wow.
[02:31:22.240 --> 02:31:26.280]   Wow, so in terms of offsetting the probability of falls,
[02:31:26.280 --> 02:31:29.280]   you talked a little bit about this before,
[02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:31.940]   but you and I have talked a little bit about this before,
[02:31:31.940 --> 02:31:34.080]   but maybe we could go a little bit deeper.
[02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:38.240]   People's ability to jump and land
[02:31:38.240 --> 02:31:40.980]   seems to be highly correlated with one's ability
[02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:45.560]   to not fall or at least fall and control the fall
[02:31:45.560 --> 02:31:49.660]   in a way that leads to no or less severe injury.
[02:31:49.660 --> 02:31:52.340]   - Yeah, so Andy Galpin talked about this on your podcast.
[02:31:52.340 --> 02:31:54.080]   He talked about it on my podcast.
[02:31:54.080 --> 02:31:59.060]   What is the hallmark of aging on the muscle?
[02:31:59.060 --> 02:32:02.220]   It is atrophy of the type two muscle fiber.
[02:32:02.220 --> 02:32:03.060]   That's the hallmark.
[02:32:03.060 --> 02:32:03.900]   - Fast twitch.
[02:32:03.900 --> 02:32:04.980]   - Fast twitch muscle fiber.
[02:32:04.980 --> 02:32:07.580]   So if you wanna understand what looks different
[02:32:07.580 --> 02:32:10.620]   in 50-year-old Peter versus 18-year-old Peter,
[02:32:10.620 --> 02:32:12.380]   it's not my type one fibers.
[02:32:12.380 --> 02:32:13.540]   It's my type two fibers.
[02:32:13.540 --> 02:32:14.500]   It's my fast twitch fibers.
[02:32:14.500 --> 02:32:15.860]   It's my explosive fibers.
[02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:16.820]   When I was 18 years old,
[02:32:16.820 --> 02:32:19.740]   I could vertical jump over 30 inches.
[02:32:19.740 --> 02:32:23.860]   Today, I'm lucky if I can vertical jump 24 inches.
[02:32:23.860 --> 02:32:27.540]   And when I'm 60, boy,
[02:32:27.540 --> 02:32:30.440]   my goal is to be able to vertical jump 20 inches
[02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:32.300]   when I'm 60, and I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do it.
[02:32:32.300 --> 02:32:35.620]   - I've seen some videos of some 80-year-old sprinters
[02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:36.560]   that are pretty impressive,
[02:32:36.560 --> 02:32:39.460]   and certainly 80-year-old gymnasts that are impressive.
[02:32:39.460 --> 02:32:41.620]   I have not seen very many videos
[02:32:41.620 --> 02:32:45.740]   of 80-year-olds dunking basketballs, for instance.
[02:32:45.740 --> 02:32:46.580]   - Yeah, it's--
[02:32:46.580 --> 02:32:49.940]   - Who are not more, who are not taller than six feet,
[02:32:49.940 --> 02:32:51.840]   five inches. - Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:55.460]   So when we lose, you know, our,
[02:32:55.460 --> 02:33:00.460]   so again, if you just think about size, strength, speed,
[02:33:00.460 --> 02:33:02.300]   we lose speed first.
[02:33:02.300 --> 02:33:04.140]   We lose speed, then strength,
[02:33:04.140 --> 02:33:06.180]   and the last thing you lose is size.
[02:33:06.180 --> 02:33:09.900]   So again, size is agnostic to fiber, right?
[02:33:09.900 --> 02:33:12.100]   You could have big type one fibers
[02:33:12.100 --> 02:33:13.640]   and still have lots of size.
[02:33:13.640 --> 02:33:14.540]   They're not gonna be that strong,
[02:33:14.540 --> 02:33:16.480]   and they're certainly not gonna be fast.
[02:33:16.480 --> 02:33:19.860]   So what, I mean, like we could go through,
[02:33:19.860 --> 02:33:21.820]   we could spend hours on this particular topic,
[02:33:21.820 --> 02:33:23.060]   but I think the most important thing
[02:33:23.060 --> 02:33:27.180]   that people need to understand is you cannot age well
[02:33:27.180 --> 02:33:30.140]   if you are not doing the type of training
[02:33:30.140 --> 02:33:34.020]   that is there to strengthen and delay or minimize
[02:33:34.020 --> 02:33:36.020]   the hypertrophy of your type two fibers.
[02:33:36.020 --> 02:33:37.540]   So everything matters, right?
[02:33:37.540 --> 02:33:39.340]   You have to be doing your zone two.
[02:33:39.340 --> 02:33:42.300]   You have to be doing, you know, all of these other things,
[02:33:42.300 --> 02:33:45.740]   but some component of your training needs to be stressing
[02:33:45.740 --> 02:33:46.620]   the type two fibers.
[02:33:46.620 --> 02:33:49.140]   You have to be doing strength training
[02:33:49.140 --> 02:33:50.500]   that taxes those fibers.
[02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:52.780]   You have to be doing reactivity training.
[02:33:52.780 --> 02:33:55.380]   You have to be doing explosive training.
[02:33:55.380 --> 02:33:57.460]   - And ideally, some training that involves
[02:33:57.460 --> 02:33:58.820]   jumping and landing.
[02:33:58.820 --> 02:34:00.300]   - Well, jumping is a very big part of it,
[02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:02.500]   and landing is a very big part of another one
[02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:05.040]   of what I kind of think of as my four pillars
[02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:06.180]   of strength training.
[02:34:06.180 --> 02:34:08.260]   So one of the pillars of strength training
[02:34:08.260 --> 02:34:11.960]   is eccentric strength, which is breaks.
[02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:16.960]   So, you know, you're gonna hurt yourself 10 times
[02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:19.680]   more likely, I'm making that number up by the way,
[02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:20.540]   I don't know if it's 10 times,
[02:34:20.540 --> 02:34:23.820]   but experientially it seems to be you are 10 times
[02:34:23.820 --> 02:34:27.060]   more likely to hurt yourself stepping off something
[02:34:27.060 --> 02:34:29.260]   than stepping onto something, right?
[02:34:29.260 --> 02:34:31.420]   Stepping down versus stepping up.
[02:34:31.420 --> 02:34:34.600]   Because when you step up onto something,
[02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:38.340]   you are concentrically controlling muscle.
[02:34:38.340 --> 02:34:42.060]   When you step down, you have to apply the breaks,
[02:34:42.060 --> 02:34:44.200]   and that's where most people falter.
[02:34:44.200 --> 02:34:46.260]   Much harder to walk downhill than uphill.
[02:34:46.260 --> 02:34:48.920]   Uphill is taxing your cardiovascular system,
[02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:51.180]   but if you slow down enough, you're fine.
[02:34:51.180 --> 02:34:52.580]   But a lot of people don't have the ability
[02:34:52.580 --> 02:34:55.060]   to slow themselves down when they're walking downhill.
[02:34:55.060 --> 02:34:58.120]   And so when an older person steps off a curb
[02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:00.700]   and can't fully stop themselves,
[02:35:00.700 --> 02:35:02.520]   and that results in a fall.
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:05.720]   So, you know, I like doing things like a broad jump.
[02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:07.940]   Broad jump's a fun little test set
[02:35:07.940 --> 02:35:09.380]   I like to do every once in a while.
[02:35:09.380 --> 02:35:11.180]   I always wanna make sure I can broad jump six feet.
[02:35:11.180 --> 02:35:13.620]   That's kind of my arbitrary number that I've chosen.
[02:35:13.620 --> 02:35:15.540]   And the reason is on the takeoff,
[02:35:15.540 --> 02:35:18.040]   that's a very explosive movement.
[02:35:18.040 --> 02:35:20.100]   But the landing is just as important.
[02:35:20.100 --> 02:35:21.820]   If I can't stick that landing,
[02:35:21.820 --> 02:35:23.420]   it means I don't have the breaks.
[02:35:23.420 --> 02:35:24.900]   So those are kind of some of the tests
[02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:27.100]   I wanna be able to do to make sure
[02:35:27.100 --> 02:35:29.160]   that I'm utilizing that system.
[02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:31.900]   Because I do think, you know, look I've watched,
[02:35:31.900 --> 02:35:33.880]   I've watched my mom, my mom fell,
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:37.380]   gosh, probably been about four months ago,
[02:35:37.380 --> 02:35:40.420]   just fell in a typical way that people fall.
[02:35:40.420 --> 02:35:41.640]   By the way, it could have happened to anybody.
[02:35:41.640 --> 02:35:43.980]   It's not like, you know, my mom walks around
[02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:46.620]   and moves around just fine, but in this particular day,
[02:35:46.620 --> 02:35:50.860]   she just tripped on a uneven stone and fell
[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:53.680]   and landed and broke her hand.
[02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:55.060]   And she's really lucky she didn't break her hip.
[02:35:55.060 --> 02:35:56.620]   And I told her that because my mom was, you know,
[02:35:56.620 --> 02:35:57.620]   probably in her mid 70s.
[02:35:57.620 --> 02:36:00.940]   And I said, look, you know, if that was your femur,
[02:36:00.940 --> 02:36:04.940]   I'd give you a 30% chance of dying in the next year.
[02:36:04.940 --> 02:36:05.940]   I mean, it's just an,
[02:36:05.940 --> 02:36:08.740]   those are such difficult to recover from injuries.
[02:36:08.740 --> 02:36:12.700]   Because first of all, you're dealing with the immobility
[02:36:12.700 --> 02:36:14.660]   of, you know, the hospitalization
[02:36:14.660 --> 02:36:16.180]   and immobility that follows that.
[02:36:16.180 --> 02:36:18.980]   And the amount of muscle loss that occurs
[02:36:18.980 --> 02:36:23.020]   could easily be, you know,
[02:36:23.020 --> 02:36:25.380]   four or five pounds of lean tissue lost
[02:36:25.380 --> 02:36:27.060]   that for most people that age
[02:36:27.060 --> 02:36:29.580]   becomes almost impossible to get back.
[02:36:29.580 --> 02:36:31.780]   And that says nothing about sort of the acute causes
[02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:33.500]   of death, like a fat embolism that results
[02:36:33.500 --> 02:36:35.940]   from a broken femur, a blood clot from laying in bed.
[02:36:35.940 --> 02:36:38.060]   Those things are also catastrophic.
[02:36:38.060 --> 02:36:39.780]   But what happens is a lot of these patients
[02:36:39.780 --> 02:36:43.180]   just never get back to the same level of mobility.
[02:36:43.180 --> 02:36:45.220]   And, you know, now I think in many ways,
[02:36:45.220 --> 02:36:47.600]   we're kind of pivoting from what kills you
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:50.020]   to what ruins your quality of life.
[02:36:50.020 --> 02:36:53.380]   And we've spent so much time talking about what kills you,
[02:36:53.380 --> 02:36:57.660]   but I think you might as well be dead in some ways
[02:36:57.660 --> 02:36:59.920]   if you can't do the things you want to do.
[02:36:59.920 --> 02:37:03.260]   And if playing with your grandkids or gardening
[02:37:03.260 --> 02:37:05.840]   or playing golf or going for a walk with your spouse
[02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:08.100]   or think of any of the things that we all do today
[02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:11.140]   and take for granted, if you can't do those things,
[02:37:11.140 --> 02:37:15.300]   I don't know, you sort of lose the reason to be around.
[02:37:15.300 --> 02:37:18.380]   - And oftentimes the inability to do those things
[02:37:18.380 --> 02:37:21.580]   is associated with pain, you know,
[02:37:21.580 --> 02:37:25.100]   which is psychologically and obviously physiologically
[02:37:25.100 --> 02:37:27.060]   so distressing.
[02:37:27.060 --> 02:37:28.580]   You mentioned the four pillars of health,
[02:37:28.580 --> 02:37:30.500]   maybe just list those off for people.
[02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:31.700]   - Of lifting?
[02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:35.680]   - Well, the four pillars of longevity through physical.
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:38.000]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.020]   Sort of the exercise pieces of them.
[02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:40.860]   - Yes.
[02:37:40.860 --> 02:37:44.040]   - Yeah, so strength, stability, aerobic efficiency,
[02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:47.300]   and aerobic peak output.
[02:37:47.300 --> 02:37:48.340]   - Okay, so aerobic peak would be--
[02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:50.020]   - So VO2 max. - VO2 max, yep.
[02:37:50.020 --> 02:37:50.980]   - And zone two.
[02:37:50.980 --> 02:37:55.980]   That's, in my analogy, your zone two is how wide
[02:37:56.080 --> 02:37:58.020]   the base of your pyramid is,
[02:37:58.020 --> 02:38:01.100]   and your VO2 max is how tall the peak of the pyramid is.
[02:38:01.100 --> 02:38:05.420]   So the best pyramid has a wide base and a high peak.
[02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:09.100]   So you could have a reasonably wide base and a shallow peak.
[02:38:09.100 --> 02:38:10.580]   If you just did zone two training,
[02:38:10.580 --> 02:38:12.140]   you're gonna get a reasonable peak,
[02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:12.980]   but it's not gonna be that high.
[02:38:12.980 --> 02:38:14.860]   You have to do some of that specific training.
[02:38:14.860 --> 02:38:16.560]   If you just focus on high intensity,
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:18.540]   you might drive up that VO2 max,
[02:38:18.540 --> 02:38:20.460]   but you're actually gonna have a relatively wide,
[02:38:20.460 --> 02:38:21.660]   a narrow aerobic base.
[02:38:21.660 --> 02:38:24.700]   So think about just maximizing the area of that triangle,
[02:38:24.700 --> 02:38:26.520]   widest, tallest.
[02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:28.580]   Stability and strength.
[02:38:28.580 --> 02:38:30.600]   Stability, of course, encompasses everything
[02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:32.840]   we're talking about in terms of reactivity.
[02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:37.660]   I dedicate a chapter in the book to this concept
[02:38:37.660 --> 02:38:40.340]   because it is so foreign to most people,
[02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:42.600]   and for understandable reasons.
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:45.800]   It's just, it's not sexy, it's not,
[02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:47.100]   it's the hardest one to train,
[02:38:47.100 --> 02:38:49.060]   it's the hardest one to understand,
[02:38:49.060 --> 02:38:50.840]   but it's so important because it's the thing
[02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:53.100]   that I think differentiates people who age well
[02:38:53.100 --> 02:38:54.940]   and people who don't age well.
[02:38:54.940 --> 02:38:57.260]   - And I should perhaps throw in there,
[02:38:57.260 --> 02:38:58.400]   please correct me if I'm wrong,
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:00.700]   but also most of the machines
[02:39:00.700 --> 02:39:03.220]   that are in typical commercial gyms
[02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:05.740]   that allow people who are not very experienced
[02:39:05.740 --> 02:39:07.700]   to start doing some resistance training
[02:39:07.700 --> 02:39:11.300]   don't really tap into the stability factor terribly much.
[02:39:11.300 --> 02:39:14.180]   So while there's value to leg extensions and leg curls
[02:39:14.180 --> 02:39:16.380]   and chest presses and shoulder presses
[02:39:16.380 --> 02:39:18.740]   done with machines, certainly,
[02:39:18.740 --> 02:39:19.620]   for a number of reasons
[02:39:19.620 --> 02:39:21.060]   and can often be safer than free weights,
[02:39:21.060 --> 02:39:23.340]   especially for people who are approaching it at a later time
[02:39:23.340 --> 02:39:25.020]   or new to the whole thing,
[02:39:25.020 --> 02:39:29.540]   they don't really lend themselves to real life stability,
[02:39:29.540 --> 02:39:32.700]   walking down, as you mentioned, walking down stairs
[02:39:32.700 --> 02:39:36.160]   in the absence of a handrail or movements
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:40.500]   in kind of odd planes, having to step aside
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:43.700]   to avoid a bicycle at an angle
[02:39:43.700 --> 02:39:46.420]   as opposed to just moving linearly.
[02:39:46.420 --> 02:39:47.460]   - Yeah, and by the way,
[02:39:47.460 --> 02:39:50.740]   a lot of things that don't involve machines
[02:39:50.740 --> 02:39:51.860]   still don't give you that, right?
[02:39:51.860 --> 02:39:53.780]   Like, I mean, doing a deadlift,
[02:39:53.780 --> 02:39:56.280]   you have to be stable to lift a heavy weight
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:39:59.060]   like you would a deadlift without hurting yourself.
[02:39:59.060 --> 02:40:01.520]   That requires an unbelievable capacity
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:04.900]   to harness intra-abdominal pressure and to be connected,
[02:40:04.900 --> 02:40:07.060]   you know, if you're gonna lift 500 pounds off the ground,
[02:40:07.060 --> 02:40:10.220]   you're stable, but that still doesn't prepare you
[02:40:10.220 --> 02:40:11.480]   for what you just described.
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:14.060]   So stability is multifaceted
[02:40:14.060 --> 02:40:16.780]   and it involves doing a lot of things.
[02:40:16.780 --> 02:40:18.580]   You know, today, for example, I finished my,
[02:40:18.580 --> 02:40:21.900]   today was a cardio zone two day, so I did my cardio zone two
[02:40:21.900 --> 02:40:24.920]   and I, you know, had an extra 10 minutes
[02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:26.920]   before I needed to kind of get moving.
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:29.500]   And so all I did was step ups for 10 minutes.
[02:40:29.500 --> 02:40:34.500]   I just did single leg, very slow step up
[02:40:34.500 --> 02:40:38.680]   and insanely slow step downs off a box in a gym.
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:41.380]   So two second up, four second down,
[02:40:41.380 --> 02:40:43.980]   two second up, four second down with, you know,
[02:40:43.980 --> 02:40:45.580]   and I would do them with ipsilateral loads,
[02:40:45.580 --> 02:40:48.300]   contralateral loads, all sorts of different things.
[02:40:48.300 --> 02:40:50.980]   And, you know, basically that's just a stability game for me.
[02:40:50.980 --> 02:40:54.500]   It's like I'm building that concentric strength
[02:40:54.500 --> 02:40:58.020]   in a movement where it's easy to cheat,
[02:40:58.020 --> 02:41:01.060]   but can I do it without cheating?
[02:41:01.060 --> 02:41:03.300]   - That's terrific and it's terrific that you cover
[02:41:03.300 --> 02:41:06.720]   all of that in the book in addition to these other topics.
[02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:09.220]   So several times during our conversation today,
[02:41:09.220 --> 02:41:11.860]   you alluded to quality of life.
[02:41:11.860 --> 02:41:15.020]   And one of my favorite segments in your book,
[02:41:15.020 --> 02:41:19.020]   indeed the segment in your book that I believe could be
[02:41:19.020 --> 02:41:22.620]   its own entire book of tremendous value
[02:41:22.620 --> 02:41:25.720]   is the section on emotional health.
[02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:28.180]   If you could just share with us a bit
[02:41:28.180 --> 02:41:31.300]   of what inspired you to include that section.
[02:41:31.300 --> 02:41:34.980]   Was this, for instance, based on communication
[02:41:34.980 --> 02:41:37.260]   with your patients, to what extent it was based
[02:41:37.260 --> 02:41:39.340]   on your own life experience.
[02:41:39.340 --> 02:41:41.500]   And then maybe we can drill a little bit deeper
[02:41:41.500 --> 02:41:44.660]   into what's contained in those chapters
[02:41:44.660 --> 02:41:47.380]   and what really constitutes emotional health.
[02:41:47.380 --> 02:41:51.860]   - Well, I mean, I think that chapter of the book,
[02:41:51.860 --> 02:41:52.980]   which is a pretty long chapter,
[02:41:52.980 --> 02:41:55.060]   it's the final chapter as well,
[02:41:55.060 --> 02:41:59.140]   is certainly different from all of the others
[02:41:59.140 --> 02:42:04.140]   in that there is no confusion about expertise, right?
[02:42:04.140 --> 02:42:08.940]   I think in the other chapters I at least try to come across
[02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:11.340]   as having some knowledge on the subject matter
[02:42:11.340 --> 02:42:15.580]   and I'm writing them most often as, you know,
[02:42:15.580 --> 02:42:17.540]   quote unquote, the doctor, right?
[02:42:17.540 --> 02:42:20.020]   Whereas I think that last chapter is much more
[02:42:20.020 --> 02:42:25.020]   about an experiential side of my knowledge acquisition
[02:42:25.020 --> 02:42:27.780]   and therefore really it comes across more as a patient.
[02:42:27.780 --> 02:42:29.880]   And I think you're right.
[02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:34.880]   I think that that's a chapter that initially was resisted
[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:38.980]   by all other parties involved in the book.
[02:42:38.980 --> 02:42:43.020]   So my co-author, my editor,
[02:42:43.020 --> 02:42:45.980]   everybody else sort of felt like this is interesting,
[02:42:45.980 --> 02:42:47.740]   but it's a separate topic.
[02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:48.700]   If you want to write about this,
[02:42:48.700 --> 02:42:50.740]   you should write another book about it,
[02:42:50.740 --> 02:42:52.840]   but it doesn't really belong in this book.
[02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:57.500]   I disagreed for two reasons
[02:42:57.500 --> 02:43:00.620]   and ultimately I guess my opinion prevailed.
[02:43:00.620 --> 02:43:03.500]   The first is I didn't want to write another book.
[02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:07.580]   So it just that, you know, not including this in this book
[02:43:07.580 --> 02:43:08.780]   to then write about it in another book
[02:43:08.780 --> 02:43:10.700]   was not something I was interested in doing.
[02:43:10.700 --> 02:43:12.460]   But I think more importantly,
[02:43:12.460 --> 02:43:15.600]   I do think that this book is about much more
[02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:17.540]   than how long you live.
[02:43:17.540 --> 02:43:21.740]   And while we have talked about and will talk about
[02:43:21.740 --> 02:43:23.660]   in the book that is, you know,
[02:43:23.660 --> 02:43:26.700]   how cognitive and physical health are just as germane
[02:43:26.700 --> 02:43:29.520]   to quality of life as they are to length of life,
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:32.140]   this other piece of emotional health,
[02:43:32.140 --> 02:43:35.780]   you know, it's potentially the most important of them all.
[02:43:35.780 --> 02:43:37.400]   It's also the hardest to define,
[02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:40.080]   but without it none of this other stuff matters, right?
[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:43.640]   So there's, you know, infinite lifespan
[02:43:43.640 --> 02:43:47.060]   if you're miserable means nothing.
[02:43:47.060 --> 02:43:48.440]   - Maybe worse.
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:49.280]   - That would be a curse, right?
[02:43:49.280 --> 02:43:54.240]   You could argue, how could you punish somebody the most,
[02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:56.420]   allow them to live forever and be miserable?
[02:43:56.420 --> 02:43:57.960]   - Is there a Greek?
[02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:00.380]   - Yeah, there's a Greek god, Tithonus, yeah.
[02:44:00.380 --> 02:44:01.440]   - Tithonus? - Yeah.
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:04.680]   He was granted immortality, it's a bit different.
[02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:07.600]   He was granted immortality, but without a health span,
[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:10.440]   basically, so he aged forever.
[02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:12.320]   - Dreadful. - Yeah.
[02:44:12.320 --> 02:44:14.880]   And this would be dreadful too, right?
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:17.800]   And then I feel like, why did I need to write about this?
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:19.500]   Well, I think that, you know,
[02:44:19.500 --> 02:44:22.000]   this is probably my greatest struggle, I think.
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:25.080]   You know, way at the outset of the podcast,
[02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:26.000]   you asked me kind of like,
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:29.000]   what are the obstacles to longevity?
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:32.360]   And that got us down a path of some very
[02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:35.200]   black and white things.
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:40.200]   But when I look at a patient, I create a dashboard.
[02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:44.100]   And the dashboard is, what are all the things
[02:44:44.100 --> 02:44:46.880]   that are a threat to every component of your longevity,
[02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:48.660]   both lifespan and health span?
[02:44:48.660 --> 02:44:49.660]   We talked about a bunch of those things.
[02:44:49.660 --> 02:44:53.320]   So what is your risk for atherosclerosis
[02:44:53.320 --> 02:44:54.960]   and what are we doing about it?
[02:44:54.960 --> 02:44:56.160]   What is your risk for cancer?
[02:44:56.160 --> 02:44:57.120]   What are we doing about it?
[02:44:57.120 --> 02:44:58.720]   What is your risk for neurodegeneration?
[02:44:58.720 --> 02:44:59.560]   What are we doing about it?
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:01.880]   What is your risk for accidental death?
[02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:03.280]   What are we doing about it?
[02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:06.020]   What is your risk for physical decline?
[02:45:06.020 --> 02:45:07.140]   What are we doing about it?
[02:45:07.140 --> 02:45:08.220]   And one of those things is,
[02:45:08.220 --> 02:45:11.620]   what is your risk of emotional health
[02:45:11.620 --> 02:45:14.420]   or poor emotional health and what are we doing about it?
[02:45:14.420 --> 02:45:20.260]   So when I do that exercise for me, which I do,
[02:45:20.260 --> 02:45:22.800]   I mean, I have that spreadsheet laid out for me
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:25.460]   and I know where my factors line up.
[02:45:25.460 --> 02:45:27.860]   And interestingly, despite my family history
[02:45:27.860 --> 02:45:30.940]   being horrible for atherosclerosis,
[02:45:30.940 --> 02:45:32.780]   it's like sixth on my list.
[02:45:33.640 --> 02:45:37.840]   Because, I mean, basically I intervened early,
[02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:40.160]   I have a clear understanding of the pathophysiology
[02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:42.860]   and I'm doing everything to the maximum.
[02:45:42.860 --> 02:45:46.160]   So I'm actually very confident I will die with
[02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:48.940]   and not from atherosclerosis.
[02:45:48.940 --> 02:45:52.900]   But the top thing on my list is actually emotional health.
[02:45:52.900 --> 02:45:56.440]   That's the one that is the hardest for me to manage.
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:00.640]   And it's the easiest to get out of balance
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:03.420]   and it creates the most pain in my life.
[02:46:03.420 --> 02:46:06.860]   So that's a long answer to why I felt
[02:46:06.860 --> 02:46:08.600]   this needed to be in here.
[02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:13.600]   - Well, in the book, you go into very honest detail
[02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:18.840]   about some of your journeys through and challenges
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:23.580]   with emotional health and paths to overcoming those.
[02:46:23.580 --> 02:46:26.400]   Maybe we'll get into those a bit, but before we do,
[02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:29.480]   how should we define emotional health?
[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:31.920]   This to me seems like one of the most difficult areas
[02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:36.920]   to calibrate oneself, like even just measuring emotion
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:40.440]   is tricky, language is the dissection tool
[02:46:40.440 --> 02:46:44.900]   for psychologists, psychiatrists, and indeed for all of us,
[02:46:44.900 --> 02:46:45.740]   how are you doing today?
[02:46:45.740 --> 02:46:48.020]   Great, or I'm miserable or I'm depressed.
[02:46:48.020 --> 02:46:50.260]   I mean, it means such different things to different people.
[02:46:50.260 --> 02:46:53.920]   Obviously, suicide being the far end of,
[02:46:53.920 --> 02:46:57.120]   we presume misery and there are instances of manic suicide,
[02:46:57.120 --> 02:47:00.320]   but depressive misery.
[02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:05.320]   But setting that aside, how should we evaluate,
[02:47:05.320 --> 02:47:10.880]   think about, and communicate emotional health
[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:14.040]   to ourselves and to the relevant people
[02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:16.600]   that could potentially help us?
[02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:20.000]   - Yeah, well, you're right, it's very difficult, right?
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:24.240]   And so much of what goes into this book
[02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:27.580]   is about things that are much easier to quantify.
[02:47:27.580 --> 02:47:29.360]   It's very, you know, I could sit here and talk for days
[02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:32.280]   about all the ways we quantify from the histologic
[02:47:32.280 --> 02:47:34.980]   to the gross of each of these diseases, you know,
[02:47:34.980 --> 02:47:36.880]   genetically, all of these other things.
[02:47:36.880 --> 02:47:41.120]   With emotional health, it's far more vague,
[02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:44.720]   and I don't even attempt to come up with a definition, right?
[02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:48.080]   I can tell you things that make up components of it.
[02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:52.680]   So connectivity with others just seems
[02:47:52.680 --> 02:47:54.680]   to be an inescapable part of this.
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:59.080]   So the ability to maintain healthy relationships
[02:47:59.080 --> 02:48:01.800]   and attachments to other people.
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:04.480]   Having, and by the way, these are in no particular order,
[02:48:04.480 --> 02:48:09.480]   having a sense of purpose, being able to regulate
[02:48:09.480 --> 02:48:14.000]   your emotions, experiencing fulfillment,
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:19.000]   experiencing satisfaction, all of these things matter,
[02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:23.940]   and I think that for many of us,
[02:48:23.940 --> 02:48:27.800]   if we're taking an honest appraisal of ourselves,
[02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:30.880]   we'll notice that we have deficits in these areas.
[02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:35.120]   Being present, by the way, that's something
[02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:39.480]   that may have been less of an issue 100 years ago
[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:40.720]   than it is today.
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:44.600]   So I think, you know, certainly for me,
[02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:47.240]   being present is very difficult.
[02:48:47.240 --> 02:48:49.520]   It's not my default state.
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:50.820]   I don't know that it's the default state
[02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:52.280]   for most people, truthfully,
[02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:56.440]   but I'm very often predisposed with thoughts
[02:48:56.440 --> 02:48:58.720]   about the future, occasionally thoughts about the past,
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:01.540]   but it's much more often kind of thoughts about the future,
[02:49:01.540 --> 02:49:04.720]   and planning, and thinking about what I need to do,
[02:49:04.720 --> 02:49:06.440]   and what do I want to do next,
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:07.960]   and never really being satisfied
[02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:09.960]   with anything that's happening in the moment.
[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:13.060]   So I have to work hard to kind of overcome those things,
[02:49:13.060 --> 02:49:15.920]   and I'm sure you can appreciate this,
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:18.160]   but when you are present,
[02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:21.240]   you generally are in a much better frame of mind.
[02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:22.840]   - Yeah, there's an interesting study,
[02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:25.500]   I think it was initially published by Dan Gilbert's lab,
[02:49:25.500 --> 02:49:28.800]   one of these long-term happiness studies
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:30.700]   that was published in Science Magazine
[02:49:30.700 --> 02:49:36.000]   that pinged people for their level of happiness,
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.680]   unhappiness, presence, or lack of presence
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:39.800]   multiple times throughout the day.
[02:49:39.800 --> 02:49:42.500]   This was in the early years of smartphones,
[02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:44.120]   so this is around 2010, 2011,
[02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:46.060]   so the technology wasn't as good as it is now,
[02:49:46.060 --> 02:49:49.240]   but it was good enough to do this in a very large number
[02:49:49.240 --> 02:49:50.200]   of people, I forget how many,
[02:49:50.200 --> 02:49:52.400]   but it's certainly more than 10,000,
[02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:56.040]   that number is, I'm stating it intentionally low.
[02:49:56.040 --> 02:49:57.820]   And what they found was regardless of whether or not
[02:49:57.820 --> 02:50:00.100]   people were doing something they enjoyed or not,
[02:50:00.100 --> 02:50:02.780]   boring to them or not,
[02:50:02.780 --> 02:50:05.220]   the degree of presence to what they were doing
[02:50:05.220 --> 02:50:09.500]   was a stronger predictor of their happiness in that moment,
[02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:12.060]   and overall, than was anything else.
[02:50:13.180 --> 02:50:16.740]   And also a fairly rare feature for most people.
[02:50:16.740 --> 02:50:19.440]   So seems like it's something that we do need to work at,
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:20.900]   perhaps nowadays, as you point out,
[02:50:20.900 --> 02:50:24.860]   more than we perhaps do in our ancestral past.
[02:50:24.860 --> 02:50:29.980]   I'm a little bit surprised that you say
[02:50:29.980 --> 02:50:31.500]   that you find it hard to be present,
[02:50:31.500 --> 02:50:34.660]   because you strike me as somebody that is not just willing,
[02:50:34.660 --> 02:50:39.660]   but has a strong, almost reflex toward drilling,
[02:50:39.660 --> 02:50:42.260]   observing the contour of something,
[02:50:42.260 --> 02:50:43.740]   and then really drilling into it,
[02:50:43.740 --> 02:50:47.560]   and really getting to the guts of most everything
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:48.860]   that interests you.
[02:50:48.860 --> 02:50:51.660]   So you strike me as somebody who's very present.
[02:50:51.660 --> 02:50:53.740]   And I guess maybe this gets back to this--
[02:50:53.740 --> 02:50:55.280]   - But they're not visually exclusive, right?
[02:50:55.280 --> 02:50:57.940]   I mean, I think, so for example,
[02:50:57.940 --> 02:51:02.620]   I'll notice that sometimes if I'm playing with my kids,
[02:51:02.620 --> 02:51:04.660]   especially my boys, 'cause they're younger, right?
[02:51:04.660 --> 02:51:09.340]   And playing with them is really being in their world.
[02:51:09.340 --> 02:51:10.860]   Like if I'm with my daughter,
[02:51:10.860 --> 02:51:13.700]   we can be doing things that are kind of mutually,
[02:51:13.700 --> 02:51:15.540]   like we'll do things together
[02:51:15.540 --> 02:51:17.260]   that I would probably do by myself,
[02:51:17.260 --> 02:51:18.160]   or she would do by herself.
[02:51:18.160 --> 02:51:20.800]   But with my boys, it's generally doing something
[02:51:20.800 --> 02:51:22.880]   I wouldn't otherwise be doing.
[02:51:22.880 --> 02:51:25.060]   And if I'm paying attention to it,
[02:51:25.060 --> 02:51:29.560]   I'm constantly amazed at how after five minutes
[02:51:29.560 --> 02:51:34.220]   of searching through a bin for just the right Lego piece
[02:51:34.220 --> 02:51:36.780]   that we wanna do to build this one little thing,
[02:51:36.780 --> 02:51:38.900]   like my mind will start thinking about something else.
[02:51:38.900 --> 02:51:40.900]   Like, oh my God, like I gotta go,
[02:51:40.900 --> 02:51:42.660]   ah, I didn't email that dude back.
[02:51:42.660 --> 02:51:44.460]   And I gotta do this, and I gotta do this,
[02:51:44.460 --> 02:51:45.660]   and I gotta do this, and I gotta do this.
[02:51:45.660 --> 02:51:48.900]   And I just get into the I gotta do, I gotta do, I gotta do.
[02:51:48.900 --> 02:51:52.180]   It's like, dude, you've only been here for five minutes.
[02:51:52.180 --> 02:51:54.580]   Why don't you just find the Lego piece
[02:51:54.580 --> 02:51:58.260]   that you need to finish building that thing over there
[02:51:58.260 --> 02:52:00.440]   that is this beautiful moment
[02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:01.820]   that you're not gonna have many of, right?
[02:52:01.820 --> 02:52:04.180]   There's a very finite number of these moments
[02:52:04.180 --> 02:52:05.220]   you're going to have.
[02:52:05.220 --> 02:52:08.300]   So you wanna savor every one of them.
[02:52:08.300 --> 02:52:11.300]   So again, I don't think I'm alone in that.
[02:52:11.300 --> 02:52:14.580]   I think a lot of parents, for example, can relate to that.
[02:52:14.580 --> 02:52:18.100]   And that's literally just one of many different things.
[02:52:18.100 --> 02:52:19.020]   And by the way, I wouldn't have said
[02:52:19.020 --> 02:52:22.020]   that that was my greatest challenge either.
[02:52:22.020 --> 02:52:24.820]   But it's something that requires,
[02:52:24.820 --> 02:52:26.360]   I think, deliberate attention.
[02:52:26.360 --> 02:52:29.680]   - What you're alluding to is a challenge
[02:52:29.680 --> 02:52:34.680]   with holding a single time perception,
[02:52:34.680 --> 02:52:36.740]   or perception of time.
[02:52:36.740 --> 02:52:38.360]   One of the most remarkable things to me
[02:52:38.360 --> 02:52:41.700]   about the human brain is our ability to be present
[02:52:41.700 --> 02:52:43.940]   or think about the past or the future
[02:52:43.940 --> 02:52:45.080]   or the present and the future.
[02:52:45.080 --> 02:52:46.860]   And we can occupy different time bins.
[02:52:46.860 --> 02:52:50.700]   And in a recent non-recorded conversation of ours,
[02:52:50.700 --> 02:52:53.420]   you showed me something that I've seen before,
[02:52:53.420 --> 02:52:57.500]   but for some reason this time it had a profound impact on me,
[02:52:57.500 --> 02:53:00.300]   which is that you have a chart of the number of weeks
[02:53:00.300 --> 02:53:01.520]   that you're going to live,
[02:53:01.520 --> 02:53:03.700]   and you mark them off one week at a time.
[02:53:03.700 --> 02:53:04.540]   We were talking about this
[02:53:04.540 --> 02:53:06.920]   in the context of major life decisions.
[02:53:06.920 --> 02:53:13.100]   And it illustrates the fact that we need such a chart
[02:53:13.100 --> 02:53:15.900]   that we can't really move through our day
[02:53:15.900 --> 02:53:19.180]   being present to the beauty of working on a Lego
[02:53:19.180 --> 02:53:22.480]   with our kid while also paying attention to the fact that,
[02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:26.100]   wow, this is week number whatever, 600 in the,
[02:53:26.100 --> 02:53:30.420]   or X number of weeks of one's life.
[02:53:30.420 --> 02:53:35.420]   So that ability to contract and dilate our time perception
[02:53:35.420 --> 02:53:39.900]   is marvelous, but it's also a double-edged sword
[02:53:39.900 --> 02:53:41.540]   'cause it's what takes us out
[02:53:41.540 --> 02:53:43.340]   of what's meaningful in the moment.
[02:53:43.340 --> 02:53:47.820]   One sort of has to wonder then
[02:53:47.820 --> 02:53:51.200]   whether or not our challenges in being present,
[02:53:51.200 --> 02:53:54.440]   I guess the psychoanalyst, maybe we need to,
[02:53:54.440 --> 02:53:57.460]   or psychiatrist, maybe we need to ask Paul Conte,
[02:53:59.260 --> 02:54:02.500]   who you know and I know and respect greatly,
[02:54:02.500 --> 02:54:06.340]   whether or not this is some subconscious refusal
[02:54:06.340 --> 02:54:08.440]   of our own mortality or something, right?
[02:54:08.440 --> 02:54:10.740]   That if we were to really contemplate our mortality
[02:54:10.740 --> 02:54:13.060]   on a regular basis, not just when we're marking off
[02:54:13.060 --> 02:54:15.740]   the weeks of the poster, we wouldn't be able to be present
[02:54:15.740 --> 02:54:17.740]   because it's kind of overwhelming, right?
[02:54:17.740 --> 02:54:20.380]   - I don't know, I feel like the literature says
[02:54:20.380 --> 02:54:23.500]   that people who spend more time contemplating
[02:54:23.500 --> 02:54:26.500]   their own mortality are actually more at peace.
[02:54:26.500 --> 02:54:29.380]   Kind of a little bit of the exposure therapy idea.
[02:54:29.380 --> 02:54:35.820]   And so I'm not sure it's an unhealthy thing
[02:54:35.820 --> 02:54:38.760]   to be aware of your mortality.
[02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:43.660]   I suspect it's helpful in as much as you accept it, right?
[02:54:43.660 --> 02:54:45.420]   And you feel like you have some agency
[02:54:45.420 --> 02:54:46.460]   over parts of it, right?
[02:54:46.460 --> 02:54:51.460]   Like I don't think I have nearly enough agency
[02:54:51.460 --> 02:54:54.340]   over the length of my life.
[02:54:54.340 --> 02:54:57.020]   I think I've got five to 10 years of wiggle room
[02:54:57.020 --> 02:54:57.980]   that I can extract.
[02:54:57.980 --> 02:55:01.220]   If I do all of the things that I've written about
[02:55:01.220 --> 02:55:05.580]   in that book, I bet I can stretch my life out 10 to 15 years
[02:55:05.580 --> 02:55:08.980]   at the maximum, call it 10, over what would have happened
[02:55:08.980 --> 02:55:10.740]   if I didn't do those things.
[02:55:10.740 --> 02:55:11.580]   Maybe it's more.
[02:55:11.580 --> 02:55:15.680]   But it depends on what we're comparing it to, right?
[02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:18.780]   From being reasonable to maybe being a little bit
[02:55:18.780 --> 02:55:21.580]   hyper functioning, maybe it's 10 years.
[02:55:21.580 --> 02:55:26.580]   Where I know I have a much greater agency is on quality.
[02:55:26.580 --> 02:55:29.740]   And for me now a big part of that
[02:55:29.740 --> 02:55:32.960]   is in terms of quality of relationships.
[02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:34.560]   I think that's a big thing.
[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:39.140]   And I think for most people that's what I hope
[02:55:39.140 --> 02:55:43.700]   this chapter does is it sort of allows more people
[02:55:43.700 --> 02:55:45.980]   to kind of take an appraisal of that
[02:55:45.980 --> 02:55:49.860]   and ask that question, which is before it's too late,
[02:55:49.860 --> 02:55:54.860]   am I living my life more for my resume virtues
[02:55:54.860 --> 02:56:01.420]   or for my eulogy virtues, to borrow from David Brooks' work,
[02:56:01.420 --> 02:56:04.060]   The Road to Character, which I talk about as being
[02:56:04.060 --> 02:56:07.420]   kind of one of the many aha moments
[02:56:07.420 --> 02:56:09.540]   that I had during this journey.
[02:56:09.540 --> 02:56:11.260]   - Yeah, and there again, thank you.
[02:56:11.260 --> 02:56:12.980]   You recommended The Road to Character.
[02:56:12.980 --> 02:56:16.460]   To me, I do an annual solo wilderness trip
[02:56:16.460 --> 02:56:18.560]   and I listen to it during the drive to that trip
[02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:22.440]   and on that trip and it's a, I would just say
[02:56:22.440 --> 02:56:25.580]   it's a truly important book for everyone to listen to.
[02:56:25.580 --> 02:56:28.900]   It's really quite impressive.
[02:56:28.900 --> 02:56:31.340]   What are the things that you do on a regular,
[02:56:31.340 --> 02:56:35.040]   let's say on a daily basis to try and enforce,
[02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:39.580]   forgive the word, but enforce emotional wellbeing
[02:56:39.580 --> 02:56:41.180]   and health in terms of relationships?
[02:56:41.180 --> 02:56:44.600]   Because as you point out, it's not reflexive for everybody
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:47.500]   and that doesn't make them bad people.
[02:56:47.500 --> 02:56:49.900]   I think it does have to do with this challenge
[02:56:49.900 --> 02:56:52.600]   in balancing expectations of work and other things
[02:56:52.600 --> 02:56:55.220]   and for some people, a more inherent selfishness
[02:56:55.220 --> 02:56:58.580]   and for some people, they aren't selfish enough.
[02:56:58.580 --> 02:57:00.160]   I know plenty of people that are running around
[02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:02.540]   trying to serve everybody and then their health is crashing
[02:57:02.540 --> 02:57:04.080]   or their mental health is crashing.
[02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:06.760]   So it can cut any which way or always.
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:09.940]   What sorts of practices do you incorporate
[02:57:09.940 --> 02:57:12.140]   or just even thoughts within your own mind?
[02:57:12.140 --> 02:57:13.600]   Do you use charts and lists?
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:16.400]   I mean, you're very regimented about your workouts,
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:21.400]   building grip strength, eccentric training zone two, et cetera.
[02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:25.160]   Why wouldn't we also script out the things
[02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:27.220]   to pay attention to each morning and day
[02:57:27.220 --> 02:57:28.860]   as a list of to-dos?
[02:57:28.860 --> 02:57:30.760]   - Well, I have done those things, right?
[02:57:30.760 --> 02:57:33.980]   So certainly, and I write about it in the book,
[02:57:33.980 --> 02:57:36.060]   I've gone away a couple of times, right?
[02:57:36.060 --> 02:57:41.060]   So in 2017, I spent two weeks at a facility in Kentucky.
[02:57:41.060 --> 02:57:44.520]   In 2020, I spent three weeks at a facility in Arizona.
[02:57:45.660 --> 02:57:48.180]   And on the back end of that facility three years ago
[02:57:48.180 --> 02:57:52.600]   when I got out, I mean, I had a very clear list
[02:57:52.600 --> 02:57:55.220]   of daily things I needed to do.
[02:57:55.220 --> 02:57:59.300]   And so at that point, for about six months following
[02:57:59.300 --> 02:58:02.160]   getting out of that stint of rehab, I mean, I was,
[02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:06.520]   I mean, God, the list of behaviors I was doing
[02:58:06.520 --> 02:58:07.420]   every single day.
[02:58:07.420 --> 02:58:09.900]   I mean, twice a day, standing in front of the mirror,
[02:58:09.900 --> 02:58:12.860]   reading my list of affirmations, writing in my journal
[02:58:12.860 --> 02:58:15.400]   every single day, I had therapy every single day.
[02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:18.640]   I mean, all of that stuff was highly regimented.
[02:58:18.640 --> 02:58:21.440]   You know, today, I would say there's no one single behavior
[02:58:21.440 --> 02:58:24.740]   that is "mandated" as part of my recovery.
[02:58:24.740 --> 02:58:28.660]   But perhaps the most important thing that does come up
[02:58:28.660 --> 02:58:33.660]   every day is being mindful of and acting on
[02:58:33.660 --> 02:58:41.900]   as quickly as possible every time I do something damaging
[02:58:41.900 --> 02:58:44.960]   to a relationship.
[02:58:44.960 --> 02:58:49.960]   So I would say that, like, if you compare Formula One,
[02:58:49.960 --> 02:58:56.860]   one of my favorites work by far, if you compare Formula One
[02:58:56.860 --> 02:59:01.540]   40 years ago to Formula One today, the difference is not
[02:59:01.540 --> 02:59:04.340]   in the number of accidents that takes place.
[02:59:04.340 --> 02:59:07.860]   The difference is in the fatality of those accidents.
[02:59:07.860 --> 02:59:10.300]   There are just as many, if not more accidents
[02:59:10.300 --> 02:59:12.380]   in Formula One today.
[02:59:12.380 --> 02:59:15.760]   The difference is nobody dies in those accidents.
[02:59:15.760 --> 02:59:18.280]   The cars are so much safer.
[02:59:18.280 --> 02:59:22.520]   They're engineered first for safety, second for performance.
[02:59:22.520 --> 02:59:24.380]   It used to be the reverse.
[02:59:24.380 --> 02:59:28.540]   And that's why there was a day when every second
[02:59:28.540 --> 02:59:31.280]   or third weekend, a driver was killed.
[02:59:31.280 --> 02:59:34.820]   It's catastrophic to imagine what took place
[02:59:34.820 --> 02:59:38.060]   between the mid 60s and about the mid 80s in Formula One.
[02:59:39.060 --> 02:59:43.620]   And similarly, I would say that the frequency
[02:59:43.620 --> 02:59:48.620]   with which I have an interaction with a person
[02:59:48.620 --> 02:59:53.080]   who matters to me that is not the best interaction
[02:59:53.080 --> 02:59:56.300]   it could be is only slightly less
[02:59:56.300 --> 02:59:58.800]   than what it was five years ago.
[02:59:58.800 --> 03:00:03.440]   The difference is the severity of that is much lower.
[03:00:03.440 --> 03:00:06.180]   And more importantly, and most importantly,
[03:00:06.180 --> 03:00:09.680]   the length of time between when I screw up
[03:00:09.680 --> 03:00:14.680]   and when I make amends is infinitely shorter, right?
[03:00:14.680 --> 03:00:17.700]   It went from being I would never make amends
[03:00:17.700 --> 03:00:22.700]   to if I'm a dick to my wife, I usually am trying
[03:00:22.700 --> 03:00:26.100]   to rectify it within a few minutes
[03:00:26.100 --> 03:00:28.020]   or at most a couple of hours.
[03:00:28.020 --> 03:00:32.380]   And so it's really, one thing I learned
[03:00:32.380 --> 03:00:37.100]   throughout this journey was if you hold yourself
[03:00:37.100 --> 03:00:38.940]   up to this goal of I have to be perfect,
[03:00:38.940 --> 03:00:39.980]   I have to be the perfect dad,
[03:00:39.980 --> 03:00:40.960]   I have to be the perfect husband,
[03:00:40.960 --> 03:00:42.760]   I have to be the perfect friend,
[03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:44.260]   you're gonna set yourself up for failure
[03:00:44.260 --> 03:00:47.260]   'cause you're just not gonna be perfect.
[03:00:47.260 --> 03:00:51.900]   But if instead you can say what I'm gonna be perfect about
[03:00:51.900 --> 03:00:56.140]   is repairing damage when I cause it, that's what matters.
[03:00:56.140 --> 03:01:02.020]   The other day, I yelled at my son for something.
[03:01:02.460 --> 03:01:03.280]   It was a while ago, actually,
[03:01:03.280 --> 03:01:04.420]   'cause it was before I lost my voice.
[03:01:04.420 --> 03:01:07.720]   So I don't know, he was just doing something,
[03:01:07.720 --> 03:01:11.020]   and he was wrong, he did something I told him 150 times
[03:01:11.020 --> 03:01:16.020]   not to do, and I yelled at him and punished him.
[03:01:16.020 --> 03:01:21.340]   But I was way too harsh, 'cause basically I basically,
[03:01:21.340 --> 03:01:24.300]   the first 27 times he did it, I didn't respond,
[03:01:24.300 --> 03:01:25.380]   and then when I finally did,
[03:01:25.380 --> 03:01:26.980]   it's like I blew a gasket, right?
[03:01:26.980 --> 03:01:31.960]   But what I realized is, yeah, you could say,
[03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:33.880]   well, maybe it hurts a child to do that,
[03:01:33.880 --> 03:01:36.580]   but I think it hurts them way less
[03:01:36.580 --> 03:01:39.720]   if you can immediately go and repair and say, hey, buddy.
[03:01:39.720 --> 03:01:42.580]   Daddy was a little harsh in that.
[03:01:42.580 --> 03:01:44.120]   I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at you like that,
[03:01:44.120 --> 03:01:45.940]   but what you did is wrong,
[03:01:45.940 --> 03:01:48.100]   and you're not gonna get to go out and play right now
[03:01:48.100 --> 03:01:50.940]   as a result of it, but I love you very much,
[03:01:50.940 --> 03:01:53.340]   and I want us to do better.
[03:01:53.340 --> 03:01:55.100]   I want you to do better in not doing this thing,
[03:01:55.100 --> 03:01:56.540]   and I wanna do better in not yelling at you
[03:01:56.540 --> 03:01:57.700]   when you do this thing.
[03:01:57.700 --> 03:01:59.940]   So it's not rocket science, right?
[03:01:59.940 --> 03:02:03.040]   But I just think I used to live my life in a way
[03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:08.040]   where all I did was break shit and never fix it.
[03:02:08.040 --> 03:02:10.960]   So you're living in a house where everything is broken,
[03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:12.580]   whereas now I still break things,
[03:02:12.580 --> 03:02:14.560]   but now I clean up the mess,
[03:02:14.560 --> 03:02:18.000]   and oh, like all of a sudden the house is better.
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:25.120]   - What is your process for when there's a need for repair,
[03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:28.980]   but you feel that it wasn't you,
[03:02:28.980 --> 03:02:33.140]   it was somebody else's error or potential error?
[03:02:33.140 --> 03:02:37.500]   So you very humbly express
[03:02:37.500 --> 03:02:41.160]   how you go about repairing your errors,
[03:02:41.160 --> 03:02:47.060]   but what about situations where a loved one, a coworker,
[03:02:47.060 --> 03:02:50.640]   you feel screwed up or wronged you, right?
[03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:53.260]   As many people do, we all do from time to time,
[03:02:53.260 --> 03:02:56.660]   feel this way, do you approach them
[03:02:57.700 --> 03:03:00.720]   and try and repair the situation?
[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:02.980]   'Cause there's a little bit less or far less control
[03:03:02.980 --> 03:03:05.820]   than the situation you described.
[03:03:05.820 --> 03:03:07.380]   And by the way, the situation you described I think
[03:03:07.380 --> 03:03:12.340]   is a perfect one because I think we all screw up.
[03:03:12.340 --> 03:03:14.420]   And so the answer to the second question
[03:03:14.420 --> 03:03:15.700]   is sort of the answer to the first,
[03:03:15.700 --> 03:03:17.820]   which is if everyone did what you were doing,
[03:03:17.820 --> 03:03:20.260]   the world would be truly a far better place,
[03:03:20.260 --> 03:03:22.620]   but not everyone's doing what you're doing.
[03:03:22.620 --> 03:03:24.820]   So if you feel wronged,
[03:03:26.700 --> 03:03:31.400]   assuming that wrong wasn't sociopathically motivated,
[03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:33.220]   what is your process for going about
[03:03:33.220 --> 03:03:36.260]   repairing a relationship fracture like that?
[03:03:36.260 --> 03:03:37.980]   - Again, this assumes that this is a relationship
[03:03:37.980 --> 03:03:38.820]   that matters, right?
[03:03:38.820 --> 03:03:40.340]   So in every interaction,
[03:03:40.340 --> 03:03:44.060]   you're only really able to optimize around one thing
[03:03:44.060 --> 03:03:45.740]   and you have to decide is this one thing
[03:03:45.740 --> 03:03:47.980]   that I'm optimizing around the relationship
[03:03:47.980 --> 03:03:49.780]   or is it the outcome?
[03:03:49.780 --> 03:03:51.300]   I mean, there are other things to optimize around,
[03:03:51.300 --> 03:03:53.220]   but you understand that those are different, right?
[03:03:53.220 --> 03:03:54.940]   - Maybe you could elaborate on that a little bit.
[03:03:54.940 --> 03:03:57.200]   I think I get it, but flesh that out a bit.
[03:03:57.200 --> 03:04:01.500]   - If I'm at the market and I'm trying to buy a new car
[03:04:01.500 --> 03:04:05.220]   and I'm sitting there talking to the car salesman,
[03:04:05.220 --> 03:04:09.220]   that's a relationship, that's an interaction.
[03:04:09.220 --> 03:04:11.760]   Now I want to buy this car for as little as possible
[03:04:11.760 --> 03:04:15.140]   and he wants to sell the car for as much as possible.
[03:04:15.140 --> 03:04:16.640]   Well, in that interaction,
[03:04:16.640 --> 03:04:18.920]   my relationship with him means nothing.
[03:04:18.920 --> 03:04:20.020]   Let's assume I don't know this guy
[03:04:20.020 --> 03:04:21.660]   and he's not like my best friend.
[03:04:23.420 --> 03:04:25.800]   I'm optimizing everything around the outcome.
[03:04:25.800 --> 03:04:28.340]   So everything I do in negotiating
[03:04:28.340 --> 03:04:30.340]   and in interacting with him personally
[03:04:30.340 --> 03:04:34.400]   is based on getting the best outcome for me.
[03:04:34.400 --> 03:04:35.840]   It's very selfish, right?
[03:04:35.840 --> 03:04:36.780]   Nothing wrong with that, by the way.
[03:04:36.780 --> 03:04:37.780]   He's doing the same thing. - Well, he's doing the same,
[03:04:37.780 --> 03:04:39.220]   right, exactly. - Absolutely.
[03:04:39.220 --> 03:04:42.660]   But now, for example, pretend that you are the car salesman
[03:04:42.660 --> 03:04:44.660]   and you're one of my closest friends
[03:04:44.660 --> 03:04:47.900]   and it's your dealership, like it's your money.
[03:04:47.900 --> 03:04:49.420]   You can't sell this thing to me at a loss.
[03:04:49.420 --> 03:04:50.700]   I don't want you to do that
[03:04:50.700 --> 03:04:54.220]   because I want you to be able to make money.
[03:04:54.220 --> 03:04:55.940]   And similarly, like you care about me
[03:04:55.940 --> 03:04:57.900]   and you don't want me to overpay for this.
[03:04:57.900 --> 03:05:00.860]   So now we're negotiating
[03:05:00.860 --> 03:05:02.820]   and we're both trying to optimize for an outcome,
[03:05:02.820 --> 03:05:05.840]   but our relationship also matters.
[03:05:05.840 --> 03:05:08.300]   It's a very different negotiation at that point.
[03:05:08.300 --> 03:05:13.020]   And so I think I always try to ask myself this question
[03:05:13.020 --> 03:05:15.580]   when I'm having some interpersonal conflict,
[03:05:15.580 --> 03:05:18.420]   which is what am I optimizing for?
[03:05:18.420 --> 03:05:23.420]   So if I'm having a quarrel with my wife,
[03:05:23.420 --> 03:05:27.980]   I have to remind myself that the outcome is,
[03:05:27.980 --> 03:05:32.000]   the objective or outcome is not necessarily the top priority.
[03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:38.220]   Being right all the time, which is my default state,
[03:05:38.220 --> 03:05:41.100]   it's just to be a bull in a China shop.
[03:05:41.100 --> 03:05:45.120]   It's to be authoritarian instead of authoritative.
[03:05:46.300 --> 03:05:50.780]   And that doesn't work if the relationship matters.
[03:05:50.780 --> 03:05:52.560]   So to answer your question,
[03:05:52.560 --> 03:05:56.860]   the first thing I'm gonna ask myself if I feel slighted
[03:05:56.860 --> 03:05:59.160]   is what is the nature of the relationship?
[03:05:59.160 --> 03:06:03.540]   Is it even worth trying to do something about this?
[03:06:03.540 --> 03:06:05.020]   And presumably you're asking the question
[03:06:05.020 --> 03:06:05.980]   because the lens is yes.
[03:06:05.980 --> 03:06:09.100]   This is someone who you care about more
[03:06:09.100 --> 03:06:11.220]   than in just a transactional way.
[03:06:11.220 --> 03:06:15.160]   Usually what I've realized is I can't try
[03:06:15.160 --> 03:06:19.340]   to approach the situation without fully understanding myself
[03:06:19.340 --> 03:06:21.000]   and that takes a while.
[03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:25.780]   So generally, and this is where I still,
[03:06:25.780 --> 03:06:29.420]   one to two times a week I'm still working with a therapist,
[03:06:29.420 --> 03:06:32.180]   I have to kind of try to figure it out on my own
[03:06:32.180 --> 03:06:33.840]   and then usually bounce it off a therapist and say,
[03:06:33.840 --> 03:06:37.960]   well, I think this is why I'm upset about this.
[03:06:37.960 --> 03:06:41.860]   I think that when this person did this or said this,
[03:06:41.860 --> 03:06:46.620]   I felt this, first of all, am I correct in what I felt?
[03:06:46.620 --> 03:06:49.660]   Because remember, sometimes you might,
[03:06:49.660 --> 03:06:51.380]   at least for me, this was the case.
[03:06:51.380 --> 03:06:54.580]   I would just feel anger in response to every interaction.
[03:06:54.580 --> 03:06:58.880]   But what I didn't realize was that anger
[03:06:58.880 --> 03:07:02.300]   was really just another emotion that was superimposed
[03:07:02.300 --> 03:07:05.660]   on top of hurt or superimposed on top of fear
[03:07:05.660 --> 03:07:08.060]   or superimposed on top of shame
[03:07:08.060 --> 03:07:10.680]   or superimposed on top of something else.
[03:07:10.680 --> 03:07:12.320]   But I didn't know how to articulate
[03:07:12.320 --> 03:07:13.540]   any of those other emotions.
[03:07:13.540 --> 03:07:16.000]   So the only thing I could really articulate was anger.
[03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:17.980]   So if anger is the only thing I know
[03:07:17.980 --> 03:07:21.240]   and anger is the only response I see, it's not very helpful.
[03:07:21.240 --> 03:07:23.460]   It's not very insightful.
[03:07:23.460 --> 03:07:24.960]   So that's a big part of it,
[03:07:24.960 --> 03:07:28.180]   is being able to deconstruct what I'm feeling.
[03:07:28.180 --> 03:07:31.760]   Oh, what I really feel is loss
[03:07:31.760 --> 03:07:35.180]   or what I really feel is abandonment right now.
[03:07:35.180 --> 03:07:38.560]   And that sometimes takes a while to figure out,
[03:07:38.560 --> 03:07:40.800]   at least for me, I'm still,
[03:07:40.800 --> 03:07:44.620]   I'm only a few years into this journey
[03:07:44.620 --> 03:07:47.340]   and maybe other people figured these things out
[03:07:47.340 --> 03:07:49.640]   when they were in their 20s and so they're veterans.
[03:07:49.640 --> 03:07:52.800]   They can do this more naturally.
[03:07:52.800 --> 03:07:53.820]   But that's step one.
[03:07:53.820 --> 03:07:56.340]   If I don't really understand what's going on,
[03:07:56.340 --> 03:07:59.620]   I can't even begin to try to approach this person
[03:07:59.620 --> 03:08:01.120]   to say, this is how I feel.
[03:08:01.120 --> 03:08:05.460]   This is, how do you feel
[03:08:05.460 --> 03:08:08.860]   and what are we optimizing for in this interaction?
[03:08:08.860 --> 03:08:14.680]   - I certainly know you are not alone in this sense.
[03:08:14.680 --> 03:08:17.080]   It's a process and it takes a lot of time
[03:08:17.080 --> 03:08:20.920]   and on a case-by-case basis can take a lot of time
[03:08:20.920 --> 03:08:23.060]   to figure out exactly what one is feeling.
[03:08:23.060 --> 03:08:26.440]   I think it really goes back to the coarseness of language
[03:08:26.440 --> 03:08:28.760]   as a way to sort one's feelings.
[03:08:28.760 --> 03:08:30.180]   It was actually your other,
[03:08:30.180 --> 03:08:31.280]   because we mentioned Paul Conti,
[03:08:31.280 --> 03:08:34.080]   who was one of your Stanford Medical School
[03:08:35.080 --> 03:08:38.760]   classmates, but another previous guest on this podcast
[03:08:38.760 --> 03:08:41.580]   who was also one of your medical school classmates,
[03:08:41.580 --> 03:08:44.400]   Dr. Carl Deisseroth, right?
[03:08:44.400 --> 03:08:48.560]   Psychiatrist and bioengineer of phenomenal stature
[03:08:48.560 --> 03:08:51.120]   and doing amazing things in the world who said,
[03:08:51.120 --> 03:08:54.880]   most of the time we have no idea how other people feel,
[03:08:54.880 --> 03:08:56.400]   even though we think we do.
[03:08:56.400 --> 03:08:58.900]   And most of the time we don't even know how we feel.
[03:08:58.900 --> 03:09:00.300]   I mean, our ability to really know
[03:09:00.300 --> 03:09:02.960]   what we're really feeling is terrible.
[03:09:03.840 --> 03:09:08.420]   And yet we recognize the broad bins.
[03:09:08.420 --> 03:09:13.420]   I'm pissed off, I'm super happy, I'm relaxed, I'm tired.
[03:09:13.420 --> 03:09:17.080]   I mean, just think about how coarse that language is
[03:09:17.080 --> 03:09:20.160]   for all the nuance and all the underlying things,
[03:09:20.160 --> 03:09:21.240]   conscious and subconscious,
[03:09:21.240 --> 03:09:22.800]   that could be driving an emotional state.
[03:09:22.800 --> 03:09:25.000]   It's really quite unbelievable.
[03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:28.200]   - Yeah, beyond the valence, positive versus negative,
[03:09:28.200 --> 03:09:31.600]   that was about the extent of my emotional language
[03:09:31.600 --> 03:09:33.280]   until somewhat recently.
[03:09:34.120 --> 03:09:35.920]   - Well, it strikes me you've come a very long way.
[03:09:35.920 --> 03:09:38.040]   Maybe you could share with us a little bit
[03:09:38.040 --> 03:09:41.000]   about what you learned on these,
[03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:42.800]   what you called retreats or,
[03:09:42.800 --> 03:09:45.620]   I mean, in the book chapter you describe
[03:09:45.620 --> 03:09:49.640]   deliberately going off to a treatment center,
[03:09:49.640 --> 03:09:51.720]   multiple treatment centers over time
[03:09:51.720 --> 03:09:54.140]   to really drill into this process
[03:09:54.140 --> 03:09:55.760]   of understanding oneself better
[03:09:55.760 --> 03:09:59.280]   and how one's current state of emotional processing
[03:09:59.280 --> 03:10:01.840]   and emotional stability are influencing relationships
[03:10:01.840 --> 03:10:03.920]   and the key importance of that.
[03:10:03.920 --> 03:10:07.560]   Was there any kind of overriding theme for you?
[03:10:07.560 --> 03:10:12.480]   For instance, could you trace back to specific events
[03:10:12.480 --> 03:10:16.920]   or themes of childhood that made a lot of it make sense?
[03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:20.700]   Or is it far more nuanced than that?
[03:10:20.700 --> 03:10:22.120]   - Well, the first thing I would say is
[03:10:22.120 --> 03:10:26.400]   I wish I could tell you that this was a very deliberate
[03:10:26.400 --> 03:10:29.560]   and wonderful choice that I just decided
[03:10:29.560 --> 03:10:32.560]   I'm gonna go on a little self-healing journey,
[03:10:32.560 --> 03:10:34.440]   but unfortunately that was not the case.
[03:10:34.440 --> 03:10:37.760]   In both cases, in 2017 and in 2020,
[03:10:37.760 --> 03:10:42.400]   I was as close to having no choice in the matter
[03:10:42.400 --> 03:10:43.680]   as one can have.
[03:10:43.680 --> 03:10:47.320]   So both of these experiences represented
[03:10:47.320 --> 03:10:51.400]   total rock bottom moments in my life.
[03:10:51.400 --> 03:10:54.780]   So these would have been the two lowest points in my life
[03:10:54.780 --> 03:10:57.320]   for different reasons, but they were nevertheless
[03:10:57.320 --> 03:10:59.880]   the two absolute low points in my life.
[03:10:59.880 --> 03:11:04.880]   And I would say in the first instance,
[03:11:04.880 --> 03:11:09.320]   I guess I could have chosen not to go,
[03:11:09.320 --> 03:11:14.280]   but I would have lost everything that mattered
[03:11:14.280 --> 03:11:15.520]   in my life at that point.
[03:11:15.520 --> 03:11:22.020]   And I had our good friend Paul Conte basically telling me
[03:11:22.020 --> 03:11:26.980]   that I needed to do this, that I really needed to do this.
[03:11:26.980 --> 03:11:28.440]   And in the second situation,
[03:11:28.440 --> 03:11:31.140]   though completely different circumstances,
[03:11:31.140 --> 03:11:32.740]   you might think how can one person
[03:11:32.740 --> 03:11:35.220]   in just a span of three years find themselves
[03:11:35.220 --> 03:11:39.080]   in a situation where they almost without having any choice
[03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:42.500]   in the matter have to go away to a place
[03:11:42.500 --> 03:11:46.340]   where you're basically locked up without a phone
[03:11:46.340 --> 03:11:51.340]   for three weeks and you're doing 12 to 13 hours
[03:11:51.340 --> 03:11:54.120]   of therapy a day.
[03:11:54.120 --> 03:11:57.480]   So nothing about this was something I wanted to do.
[03:11:57.480 --> 03:11:59.020]   Nothing about this was pleasant.
[03:11:59.020 --> 03:12:02.480]   I would describe these as the most difficult things
[03:12:02.480 --> 03:12:05.520]   I've ever done in my life, bar none.
[03:12:05.520 --> 03:12:07.480]   And I've done some difficult things in my life.
[03:12:07.480 --> 03:12:09.480]   But they've always been physically difficult.
[03:12:09.480 --> 03:12:12.200]   I love doing physically difficult things.
[03:12:12.200 --> 03:12:16.340]   But this was emotionally the equivalent of, for me,
[03:12:16.340 --> 03:12:19.900]   climbing K2 and swimming the English Channel
[03:12:19.900 --> 03:12:21.160]   in the same month.
[03:12:21.160 --> 03:12:23.100]   Something that you couldn't fathom.
[03:12:24.100 --> 03:12:28.420]   So with that said, yes, I learned a lot.
[03:12:28.420 --> 03:12:33.420]   And I learned that people like me can be overly analytical
[03:12:33.420 --> 03:12:41.100]   and that hyper-analytical nature can lead you astray
[03:12:41.100 --> 03:12:50.660]   when you think that your intellect is giving you
[03:12:50.660 --> 03:12:54.580]   a fact-based explanation for a set of circumstances
[03:12:54.580 --> 03:12:58.120]   and you rationalize them away.
[03:12:58.120 --> 03:13:00.900]   Well, this happened to me when I was a kid.
[03:13:00.900 --> 03:13:05.220]   But I get it and it's not really a problem.
[03:13:05.220 --> 03:13:10.220]   And as a result of that, these are actually
[03:13:10.220 --> 03:13:13.120]   some positive things that came out of that experience.
[03:13:13.120 --> 03:13:18.120]   And I think the real aha moment in my journey
[03:13:18.300 --> 03:13:23.300]   which occurred on a day that I remember very well
[03:13:23.300 --> 03:13:27.260]   was the day I finally dropped that.
[03:13:27.260 --> 03:13:31.860]   I dropped that rationalization.
[03:13:31.860 --> 03:13:36.860]   And I allowed myself to experience what a child
[03:13:36.860 --> 03:13:41.380]   would experience in that moment and then understood
[03:13:41.380 --> 03:13:47.620]   what the implications are for a child
[03:13:47.620 --> 03:13:50.980]   going through these things.
[03:13:50.980 --> 03:13:55.180]   And I think that was really the first time in my life
[03:13:55.180 --> 03:13:58.260]   I ever accepted emotionally something that I had
[03:13:58.260 --> 03:14:00.980]   intellectually always said, yeah, it doesn't really matter.
[03:14:00.980 --> 03:14:02.620]   I mean, it's just, you know, that's just life
[03:14:02.620 --> 03:14:06.060]   and those things happen and lots of worse things happen
[03:14:06.060 --> 03:14:08.620]   to lots of people and that's okay.
[03:14:08.620 --> 03:14:13.520]   And I think it's not that once I emotionally accepted this,
[03:14:13.520 --> 03:14:16.320]   I became a victim, it wasn't at all.
[03:14:16.320 --> 03:14:17.980]   It just finally allowed me to realize,
[03:14:17.980 --> 03:14:19.740]   oh, I can let that go now.
[03:14:19.740 --> 03:14:24.740]   I don't have to be a slave to the adaptations
[03:14:24.740 --> 03:14:28.820]   that came from that.
[03:14:28.820 --> 03:14:31.040]   I can surrender.
[03:14:31.040 --> 03:14:37.820]   - That's beautiful and inspiring to me.
[03:14:37.820 --> 03:14:43.660]   I think that, yeah, there's this incredible ability
[03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:47.500]   that the human brain has to script a story
[03:14:47.500 --> 03:14:49.700]   and to compare to other people's circumstances.
[03:14:49.700 --> 03:14:53.340]   And as you said, rationalize what are essentially
[03:14:53.340 --> 03:14:56.700]   emotional traumas or physical traumas
[03:14:56.700 --> 03:14:59.820]   from the perspective of the adult.
[03:14:59.820 --> 03:15:03.880]   But if I know one thing for sure, and I make it very clear,
[03:15:03.880 --> 03:15:08.020]   I'm not a clinician, but is that the brain doesn't discard
[03:15:08.020 --> 03:15:08.860]   of any circuitry.
[03:15:08.860 --> 03:15:11.940]   We repurpose the same circuitry we used as children,
[03:15:11.940 --> 03:15:15.600]   as adults and so the ability to go back to that
[03:15:15.600 --> 03:15:18.360]   and to parse it, but as you point out,
[03:15:18.360 --> 03:15:21.900]   not from an intellectual standpoint,
[03:15:21.900 --> 03:15:23.700]   but from an emotional standpoint,
[03:15:23.700 --> 03:15:26.080]   seems to be the really hard work.
[03:15:26.080 --> 03:15:29.620]   Do you do that on a regular basis?
[03:15:29.620 --> 03:15:31.360]   - No, not at all.
[03:15:31.360 --> 03:15:33.420]   It's been done a handful of times.
[03:15:33.420 --> 03:15:37.320]   It's been exhausting.
[03:15:37.320 --> 03:15:38.920]   It's very difficult.
[03:15:38.920 --> 03:15:43.680]   It's, I don't know if this is the right word.
[03:15:43.680 --> 03:15:46.180]   I would almost describe it as emotionally violent.
[03:15:46.180 --> 03:15:52.840]   And it's not something I need to revisit often truthfully.
[03:15:52.840 --> 03:15:57.860]   I think that, yeah, it's been done a finite number of times
[03:15:57.860 --> 03:16:04.520]   and I think I've captured so much value from it
[03:16:04.520 --> 03:16:07.100]   that there are lots of other things I continue to do.
[03:16:07.100 --> 03:16:12.100]   I mean, I use a system called dialectical behavioral therapy
[03:16:12.100 --> 03:16:15.060]   that is a regular part of the therapy that I do,
[03:16:15.060 --> 03:16:18.240]   but I don't have to go back to my childhood.
[03:16:18.240 --> 03:16:21.400]   I don't have to go back to uncovering
[03:16:21.400 --> 03:16:24.080]   and re-exploring a lot of that stuff.
[03:16:24.080 --> 03:16:28.980]   I've learned the lessons and now it's really
[03:16:28.980 --> 03:16:31.000]   about practicing the skills.
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:34.180]   I know what I want now and I know,
[03:16:34.180 --> 03:16:35.440]   you talk about plasticity.
[03:16:35.440 --> 03:16:37.200]   I'll share one example, which I know I wrote about
[03:16:37.200 --> 03:16:39.700]   in the book, but just for folks listening,
[03:16:39.700 --> 03:16:41.600]   that you'll appreciate.
[03:16:41.600 --> 03:16:46.480]   So I, just one of the hallmarks of my existence
[03:16:46.480 --> 03:16:51.480]   has always been just an insane amount of anger and rage.
[03:16:51.480 --> 03:16:54.760]   It's been there as long as I've known.
[03:16:54.760 --> 03:16:59.040]   So I don't have a conscious memory of not having rage, right?
[03:16:59.040 --> 03:17:03.160]   So earliest memories of life when I'm five years old,
[03:17:03.160 --> 03:17:05.220]   I have rage like you can't believe.
[03:17:05.220 --> 03:17:07.420]   And it's a problem all my life.
[03:17:07.420 --> 03:17:10.920]   So as a teenager, if I go more than two weeks
[03:17:10.920 --> 03:17:13.140]   without punching a hole in the wall of our house,
[03:17:13.140 --> 03:17:14.460]   it's a miracle.
[03:17:14.460 --> 03:17:16.540]   I mean, I am so good at drywall.
[03:17:16.540 --> 03:17:20.100]   You can't believe how good I am for all the stuff
[03:17:20.100 --> 03:17:21.600]   I have to repair around our house.
[03:17:21.600 --> 03:17:24.220]   Like I'm breaking windows, I'm breaking,
[03:17:24.220 --> 03:17:26.220]   it just doesn't matter, like I just,
[03:17:26.220 --> 03:17:28.940]   and so in a way, and of course I rationalized
[03:17:28.940 --> 03:17:30.940]   how much boxing saved my life
[03:17:30.940 --> 03:17:34.380]   because I had this amazing outlet for my rage, right?
[03:17:34.380 --> 03:17:38.860]   If you, I got to basically exercise six hours a day,
[03:17:38.860 --> 03:17:42.540]   I'm hitting punching bags and people all day long,
[03:17:42.540 --> 03:17:45.780]   and it's just a beautiful outlet that keeps me out of jail.
[03:17:45.780 --> 03:17:52.040]   And a big part of that rage was inward, right?
[03:17:52.040 --> 03:17:54.900]   So it's not rocket science to understand
[03:17:54.900 --> 03:17:58.940]   that a person who has that much hatred for everyone
[03:17:58.940 --> 03:18:02.040]   has an enormous amount for themselves.
[03:18:02.040 --> 03:18:06.840]   And so one of the things I didn't realize was happening
[03:18:06.840 --> 03:18:08.700]   was what my inner monologue was.
[03:18:08.700 --> 03:18:11.600]   Because as you can appreciate, your inner monologue
[03:18:11.600 --> 03:18:16.600]   is so frequent and ubiquitous and present
[03:18:16.600 --> 03:18:20.480]   that it's easy to almost forget that it's there.
[03:18:20.480 --> 03:18:25.480]   I mean, that's the sort of dangerous part about it, right?
[03:18:25.480 --> 03:18:30.280]   Is kind of the David Foster Wallace, this is water thing.
[03:18:30.280 --> 03:18:32.780]   The fish are swimming through water.
[03:18:32.780 --> 03:18:33.620]   The water's everywhere.
[03:18:33.620 --> 03:18:35.360]   They don't even realize they're in water.
[03:18:35.360 --> 03:18:39.640]   You don't realize the subconscious stream of thoughts
[03:18:39.640 --> 03:18:40.780]   that constantly flow.
[03:18:40.780 --> 03:18:44.100]   But eventually I became aware
[03:18:44.100 --> 03:18:46.800]   of just what that self-talk was.
[03:18:46.800 --> 03:18:50.960]   And it is, it was no longer the case.
[03:18:50.960 --> 03:18:55.960]   It was the angriest, the most violent self-talk
[03:18:55.960 --> 03:18:58.440]   you can imagine.
[03:18:58.440 --> 03:19:03.440]   I mean, it was like, there is no mistake that I could make
[03:19:03.440 --> 03:19:08.360]   that was anything other than my perfect, perfect standard
[03:19:08.360 --> 03:19:11.960]   that didn't result in what I would call
[03:19:11.960 --> 03:19:15.340]   my inner Bobby Knight going ballistic.
[03:19:15.340 --> 03:19:17.320]   So it just didn't matter.
[03:19:17.320 --> 03:19:20.840]   Like it sounds silly under, it didn't matter.
[03:19:20.840 --> 03:19:23.720]   If I didn't perfectly cook a steak,
[03:19:23.720 --> 03:19:27.120]   if I didn't perfectly nail something I was doing,
[03:19:27.120 --> 03:19:30.080]   if I didn't do anything that was perfect
[03:19:30.080 --> 03:19:32.760]   at what I described as match grade perfect,
[03:19:32.760 --> 03:19:38.160]   I mean, I would want to beat myself to a pulp
[03:19:38.160 --> 03:19:40.440]   and I would scream at myself.
[03:19:40.440 --> 03:19:44.160]   I mean, it just, again, it's hard to describe.
[03:19:44.160 --> 03:19:46.160]   And I hope that most people listening to this
[03:19:46.160 --> 03:19:48.020]   don't understand what that feels like.
[03:19:48.020 --> 03:19:52.660]   Well, it became very clear that that had to change
[03:19:52.660 --> 03:19:56.600]   because when you are that,
[03:19:56.600 --> 03:19:59.560]   when you hate yourself that much, by definition,
[03:19:59.560 --> 03:20:03.360]   you are going to be an insufferable prick to everybody else.
[03:20:03.360 --> 03:20:05.400]   'Cause you're just, that's gonna spill
[03:20:05.400 --> 03:20:07.240]   into how you interact with the world.
[03:20:07.240 --> 03:20:13.360]   So I was working with a therapist who was one of the people
[03:20:13.360 --> 03:20:18.000]   who was sending me to this place in Arizona.
[03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:22.600]   And basically it became clear that they proposed
[03:20:22.600 --> 03:20:26.580]   that I could shed this trait if I was willing
[03:20:26.580 --> 03:20:29.000]   to do a certain amount of work.
[03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:31.600]   And I was like, there's no chance.
[03:20:31.600 --> 03:20:34.020]   Like I'm 47 years old.
[03:20:34.020 --> 03:20:36.440]   This is the only way I've ever interacted with myself.
[03:20:36.440 --> 03:20:39.200]   How in the world could this be undone?
[03:20:39.200 --> 03:20:41.680]   It would take another 40 years to undo this.
[03:20:41.680 --> 03:20:42.820]   And they're like, no, no,
[03:20:42.820 --> 03:20:44.840]   here's this exercise you're gonna do.
[03:20:44.840 --> 03:20:49.840]   So the exercise was every single time I did something
[03:20:50.700 --> 03:20:53.760]   where I would have that self-talk,
[03:20:53.760 --> 03:20:56.080]   I would have to immediately stop myself
[03:20:56.080 --> 03:21:01.860]   and pretend that it wasn't me that just did that,
[03:21:01.860 --> 03:21:04.740]   but it was one of my closest friends.
[03:21:04.740 --> 03:21:09.080]   And instead I would audibly speak to that person,
[03:21:09.080 --> 03:21:10.200]   there was nobody else there,
[03:21:10.200 --> 03:21:13.920]   but speak to that person as though they are the one
[03:21:13.920 --> 03:21:14.760]   that made the mistake.
[03:21:14.760 --> 03:21:16.500]   And I was to record that on my phone.
[03:21:16.500 --> 03:21:19.840]   So I'm out there shooting my bow and arrow
[03:21:19.840 --> 03:21:21.960]   and I don't get a bullseye.
[03:21:21.960 --> 03:21:23.640]   Instead of screaming at myself,
[03:21:23.640 --> 03:21:26.200]   I have to say, oh, imagine it's my buddy JR
[03:21:26.200 --> 03:21:27.440]   who just missed that shot.
[03:21:27.440 --> 03:21:29.260]   What would I say to him?
[03:21:29.260 --> 03:21:31.840]   Pick up the phone or pull out the phone
[03:21:31.840 --> 03:21:34.380]   and say, of course, something different.
[03:21:34.380 --> 03:21:36.360]   And of course, what I would say in that situation
[03:21:36.360 --> 03:21:38.840]   was much kinder, I mean, infinitely kinder.
[03:21:38.840 --> 03:21:41.660]   It's like from saying it to my closest friend,
[03:21:41.660 --> 03:21:44.480]   I'm gonna say it in a very kind way.
[03:21:44.480 --> 03:21:47.860]   And I had to take a copy of that audio
[03:21:47.860 --> 03:21:49.520]   and text it to my therapist.
[03:21:49.520 --> 03:21:50.360]   - Oh, wow.
[03:21:50.360 --> 03:21:51.180]   - Yeah.
[03:21:51.180 --> 03:21:52.020]   - Talk about vulnerabilities.
[03:21:52.020 --> 03:21:52.860]   - So can you imagine--
[03:21:52.860 --> 03:21:53.800]   - I was all on board this practice
[03:21:53.800 --> 03:21:55.640]   until you mentioned that at which point,
[03:21:55.640 --> 03:21:59.520]   and I trust my therapist to a very deep level,
[03:21:59.520 --> 03:22:03.240]   but I thought, wow, that's a mountain.
[03:22:03.240 --> 03:22:06.680]   - Well, this poor person got a lot of text messages,
[03:22:06.680 --> 03:22:08.180]   a lot of audio files.
[03:22:08.180 --> 03:22:12.440]   But here's the part that just blows my mind.
[03:22:12.440 --> 03:22:16.440]   It only took, I don't know, I can't remember exactly.
[03:22:16.440 --> 03:22:17.920]   I'd have to go back to look at my journals.
[03:22:17.920 --> 03:22:21.040]   It only took about four months to get rid of Bobby Knight.
[03:22:21.040 --> 03:22:25.200]   Again, we had kind of a mental model
[03:22:25.200 --> 03:22:26.080]   for what this looked like,
[03:22:26.080 --> 03:22:29.200]   which was Bobby Knight was the chairman of the board.
[03:22:29.200 --> 03:22:31.840]   He sat in the boardroom and nobody else got to talk.
[03:22:31.840 --> 03:22:32.720]   - And for those that don't know,
[03:22:32.720 --> 03:22:35.140]   Bobby Knight had a terrible temper.
[03:22:35.140 --> 03:22:35.980]   - Yeah.
[03:22:35.980 --> 03:22:36.800]   - Yeah, the worst.
[03:22:36.800 --> 03:22:38.040]   - Right, this is the guy that was throwing chairs
[03:22:38.040 --> 03:22:39.120]   across the basketball court.
[03:22:39.120 --> 03:22:41.520]   - Level 11 out of 10.
[03:22:41.520 --> 03:22:45.000]   - And all of a sudden, we got to the point
[03:22:45.000 --> 03:22:49.080]   where Bobby Knight is not even in the boardroom anymore.
[03:22:49.080 --> 03:22:52.000]   In fact, as I say this today,
[03:22:52.000 --> 03:22:54.820]   I don't really remember what he sounded like.
[03:22:54.820 --> 03:22:58.520]   I mean, it's amazing to me.
[03:22:58.520 --> 03:23:02.040]   And I've had some really amazing opportunities
[03:23:02.040 --> 03:23:03.120]   to bring him back.
[03:23:03.120 --> 03:23:06.660]   Like, it's not like I'm making fewer mistakes, right?
[03:23:06.660 --> 03:23:11.040]   It's not like I'm better today than I was three years ago
[03:23:11.040 --> 03:23:12.240]   at all the things that I do.
[03:23:12.240 --> 03:23:15.640]   I'm not, I'm actually probably worse in many regards.
[03:23:15.640 --> 03:23:20.640]   But the difference is, I can communicate with myself.
[03:23:20.640 --> 03:23:25.480]   I think I can say this, I think I can say lovingly, right?
[03:23:25.480 --> 03:23:29.520]   And maybe not as lovingly as some people can.
[03:23:29.520 --> 03:23:31.560]   I still think I'm probably,
[03:23:31.560 --> 03:23:35.920]   maybe just a little higher standard with myself
[03:23:35.920 --> 03:23:38.260]   than maybe I need to be at times.
[03:23:38.260 --> 03:23:42.200]   But I'm just not beating myself up like I used to.
[03:23:42.200 --> 03:23:43.760]   And I think by extension,
[03:23:43.760 --> 03:23:46.200]   I'm beating other people up a lot less.
[03:23:46.200 --> 03:23:47.300]   - Well, I don't know the extent
[03:23:47.300 --> 03:23:51.640]   to which your internal narrative reflects the narrative
[03:23:51.640 --> 03:23:52.920]   that others have about you.
[03:23:52.920 --> 03:23:55.120]   But first of all, I want to thank you
[03:23:55.120 --> 03:23:57.920]   for sharing what you just shared.
[03:23:57.920 --> 03:24:00.200]   I think as a practical step,
[03:24:00.200 --> 03:24:03.660]   first of all, it's one I've never heard of before,
[03:24:03.660 --> 03:24:08.060]   but certainly represents this incredible phenomenon
[03:24:08.060 --> 03:24:09.000]   of neuroplasticity.
[03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:10.640]   Because four months sounds like a bit of time,
[03:24:10.640 --> 03:24:12.360]   yet you're 47 years old.
[03:24:12.360 --> 03:24:14.340]   So that's 47 years of accumulated,
[03:24:14.340 --> 03:24:18.740]   just absolutely berating self-talk is what it sounds like.
[03:24:18.740 --> 03:24:23.400]   So it's something that people can think about
[03:24:23.400 --> 03:24:28.160]   for their own purposes and their own challenges.
[03:24:28.160 --> 03:24:32.160]   Also, I've read the book twice now and love it.
[03:24:32.160 --> 03:24:35.100]   As I put in my endorsement of it,
[03:24:35.100 --> 03:24:37.860]   I think it's not just informative,
[03:24:37.860 --> 03:24:39.560]   but it's indeed important
[03:24:39.560 --> 03:24:43.900]   because it centers on so many of the key actionable items
[03:24:43.900 --> 03:24:48.900]   related to healthspan and lifespan, vitality, longevity,
[03:24:48.900 --> 03:24:50.400]   whatever people want to call these things
[03:24:50.400 --> 03:24:52.400]   that are essential.
[03:24:52.400 --> 03:24:54.560]   But also the section on emotional health
[03:24:54.560 --> 03:24:57.560]   was absolutely profound for me.
[03:24:57.560 --> 03:24:59.440]   It inspired a huge number of changes.
[03:24:59.440 --> 03:25:02.920]   And the book as a whole represents
[03:25:02.920 --> 03:25:06.640]   a very important contribution to everybody.
[03:25:06.640 --> 03:25:10.880]   There are numerous points and I would say every chapter
[03:25:10.880 --> 03:25:12.060]   is applicable to everybody.
[03:25:12.060 --> 03:25:14.580]   And there are very few books out there like that.
[03:25:14.580 --> 03:25:17.040]   So I want to thank you for that.
[03:25:17.040 --> 03:25:19.160]   And especially for including the section
[03:25:19.160 --> 03:25:20.480]   on emotional health.
[03:25:20.480 --> 03:25:23.440]   And especially for sharing what you did today,
[03:25:23.440 --> 03:25:27.520]   because I think it doesn't just take a bit of vulnerability,
[03:25:27.520 --> 03:25:29.800]   but a ton of vulnerability and humility
[03:25:29.800 --> 03:25:32.420]   to be able to share what you just shared.
[03:25:32.420 --> 03:25:36.480]   And my only request or wish is that you also,
[03:25:36.480 --> 03:25:37.600]   hopefully internalize it,
[03:25:37.600 --> 03:25:39.480]   the tremendous gift that you're giving everybody
[03:25:39.480 --> 03:25:41.980]   through coming on podcasts like this,
[03:25:41.980 --> 03:25:45.200]   doing your own podcasts, writing the book.
[03:25:45.200 --> 03:25:48.500]   I look out on the landscape of front facing,
[03:25:48.500 --> 03:25:51.660]   public facing health out there.
[03:25:51.660 --> 03:25:55.880]   And you sit not alone, but in a unique stance
[03:25:55.880 --> 03:25:58.200]   as the medical doctor that I do believe
[03:25:58.200 --> 03:26:01.180]   that people trust the very most.
[03:26:01.180 --> 03:26:04.880]   Because of the fact that you have that intense rigor.
[03:26:05.800 --> 03:26:07.060]   I wouldn't even say your desire,
[03:26:07.060 --> 03:26:11.520]   your absolute obsession with measurement and precision.
[03:26:11.520 --> 03:26:13.680]   Many of the things that a moment ago you were pointing to
[03:26:13.680 --> 03:26:17.000]   as potentially hazards for your emotional life,
[03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:20.080]   but that serve all of us, the general public,
[03:26:20.080 --> 03:26:25.800]   so preciously and with just incalculable value.
[03:26:25.800 --> 03:26:27.720]   So I hope that internalizes as well.
[03:26:27.720 --> 03:26:29.780]   Maybe it'll even weave into your self-talk.
[03:26:29.780 --> 03:26:31.320]   Maybe I need to send you a script every day,
[03:26:31.320 --> 03:26:33.000]   but in all seriousness,
[03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:35.260]   I also want to thank you for taking the time today.
[03:26:35.260 --> 03:26:37.480]   And even though it's a personal thing,
[03:26:37.480 --> 03:26:38.580]   I really want to thank you
[03:26:38.580 --> 03:26:43.460]   for being an amazing colleague to me in the podcast space,
[03:26:43.460 --> 03:26:47.680]   in the health and medicine space, whatever that is.
[03:26:47.680 --> 03:26:50.460]   And also just an incredible friend.
[03:26:50.460 --> 03:26:53.600]   You've been a tremendous source of support and guidance
[03:26:53.600 --> 03:26:56.220]   in every one of the domains that we talked about today
[03:26:56.220 --> 03:26:57.540]   and many more.
[03:26:57.540 --> 03:26:58.700]   And again, I just want to say
[03:26:58.700 --> 03:27:01.100]   that this emotional health component, I agree with you.
[03:27:01.100 --> 03:27:03.960]   I think it's not just vital.
[03:27:03.960 --> 03:27:06.960]   I think it's the most vital of all of them.
[03:27:06.960 --> 03:27:11.960]   So you've just made numerous important contributions.
[03:27:11.960 --> 03:27:15.320]   And I just want to thank you for sharing
[03:27:15.320 --> 03:27:17.340]   that you clearly put everything you have
[03:27:17.340 --> 03:27:19.600]   into everything you do.
[03:27:19.600 --> 03:27:20.520]   Thank you, Peter.
[03:27:20.520 --> 03:27:21.360]   - Andrew, thank you.
[03:27:21.360 --> 03:27:23.840]   I really appreciate you making the time for us to sit down
[03:27:23.840 --> 03:27:25.720]   and talk in a long form way, which I enjoy.
[03:27:25.720 --> 03:27:30.300]   And yeah, it's an honor and it means a lot to me
[03:27:30.300 --> 03:27:33.340]   that you have read it twice and that you've appreciated it
[03:27:33.340 --> 03:27:36.360]   and praised it as you have.
[03:27:36.360 --> 03:27:37.540]   Thank you.
[03:27:37.540 --> 03:27:38.840]   - Thank you once again for joining me
[03:27:38.840 --> 03:27:41.560]   for today's discussion with Dr. Peter Attia.
[03:27:41.560 --> 03:27:44.280]   I hope you learned as much and enjoy the conversation
[03:27:44.280 --> 03:27:45.280]   as much as I did.
[03:27:45.280 --> 03:27:47.420]   Please also check out Dr. Attia's new book,

[03:28:27.360 --> 03:28:29.220]   On various episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:28:29.220 --> 03:28:32.020]   we discuss supplements while supplements aren't necessary.
[03:28:32.020 --> 03:28:34.240]   For everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit
[03:28:34.240 --> 03:28:36.620]   from them for things like improving sleep,
[03:28:36.620 --> 03:28:39.360]   supporting hormones, improving focus, and so on.
[03:28:39.360 --> 03:28:41.220]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to have partnered
[03:28:41.220 --> 03:28:42.340]   with Momentous Supplements.
[03:28:42.340 --> 03:28:43.460]   If you'd like to see the supplements

[03:28:55.700 --> 03:28:56.540]   and LinkedIn.
[03:28:56.540 --> 03:28:57.980]   And at all of those places,
[03:28:57.980 --> 03:28:59.620]   I cover science and science-based tools,
[03:28:59.620 --> 03:29:01.180]   some of which overlap with the contents
[03:29:01.180 --> 03:29:02.280]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:29:02.280 --> 03:29:04.540]   but much of which is distinct from the content covered
[03:29:04.540 --> 03:29:05.660]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[03:29:05.660 --> 03:29:08.480]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.

[03:29:16.660 --> 03:29:19.820]   how to enhance the quality and duration of your sleep,
[03:29:19.820 --> 03:29:21.940]   toolkit for focus, toolkit for neuroplasticity,
[03:29:21.940 --> 03:29:24.060]   toolkit for deliberate cold exposure, heat exposure,

[03:29:25.960 --> 03:29:27.260]   All of those toolkits can be found
[03:29:27.260 --> 03:29:29.100]   by going to HubermanLab.com.
[03:29:29.100 --> 03:29:31.340]   Go to the menu, scroll down to newsletter,
[03:29:31.340 --> 03:29:32.500]   and simply give us your email.
[03:29:32.500 --> 03:29:34.420]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[03:29:34.420 --> 03:29:35.820]   And again, the newsletters and toolkits
[03:29:35.820 --> 03:29:36.960]   are completely zero cost.
[03:29:36.960 --> 03:29:39.660]   And you will also find some PDF examples
[03:29:39.660 --> 03:29:40.680]   of previous toolkits.
[03:29:40.680 --> 03:29:42.780]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com.
[03:29:42.780 --> 03:29:44.180]   Thank you once again for joining me

[03:29:46.700 --> 03:29:48.960]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:29:48.960 --> 03:29:50.860]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:29:50.860 --> 03:29:53.440]   [upbeat music]
[03:29:53.440 --> 03:29:56.020]   (upbeat music)
