[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.080]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.160]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.480]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.480]   My name is Joshua. I am your host.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.600]   And today I have some relatively simple thoughts for you on what it means to live well.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.000]   What is a life well lived?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.760]   How do you live well?
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.760]   I was inspired to create this short show for you because of two influences
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.120]   that stumbled into my life over the last day or two.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.440]   The first was an essay by famous country singer Charlie Daniels
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.440]   called Observations on Turning 82.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.240]   I don't know how I stumbled across this in my web wanderings, but I did.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.720]   And he wrote this little essay called Observations on Turning 82.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.360]   I'm going to read that to you and then contrast that in just a moment with something else.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.560]   Now, I personally pay a lot of attention to this genre of literature
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.760]   when people write, people who are older,
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.160]   who are coming into the twilight years of their life, and they write
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.120]   about what they've learned in living their life.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.640]   I pay a lot of attention to what they say.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.400]   And I believe that it's an area where we as US Americans are largely deficient
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.880]   in valuing and honoring and listening to people who are older.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.080]   And so I want to help change that.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.520]   And so I listen to essays like this very carefully.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.440]   I'll just read it to you and then we'll go with the example to compare this to
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.760]   in just a moment.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.800]   Again, Charlie Daniels writes this Observations on Turning 82.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.360]   October 28, 2018.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.000]   God willing, I will turn 82 years old.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.600]   What are you supposed to be doing and how are you supposed to act when you're 82?
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.920]   Should there be an added degree of sophistication, a thicker veneer of dignity
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.960]   with most of your attention aimed toward the weightier things of life?
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.960]   Or maybe sit in a rocking chair and regale anyone who will listen with tales of the good old days.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.240]   Or maybe spend your days in a bass rig or on a golf course
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.760]   or indulging in some sedentary hobby or just sleeping late and learning to name the players
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.800]   and identify with the ongoing tragedies in the lives of soap opera characters.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.240]   Well, to those who choose to spend their golden years in such pursuits,
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.640]   as they say down under, good on you, mate.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.520]   Hats off, kudos, well wishes and bon voyage on your chosen method of cruising into the sunset.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.080]   But as for me, I look at my next year of life as another journey through the competition,
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.480]   hassle, hustle, bustle, fast moving and sometimes trying
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.360]   an absolutely wonderful world that I have spent the last 60 plus years in.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.400]   Half of the 100 plus show dates we'll be doing in 2019 are already on the books.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.520]   I have three new CDs and a new book coming out almost simultaneously
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.640]   with plans for my first novel to be finished and published sometime during the next 14 months.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.240]   I have a head full of dreams, bits and pieces of songs, venues that I'd like to play again
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.320]   and fully intend to make at least one more journey to the Holy Land
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.800]   before I hang up my international traveling shoes.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.040]   I've got quite a lot of musical avenues I'd love to travel down
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.960]   and people I thoroughly enjoy playing with to travel down them with me.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.560]   I'm content with my band, road crew, ranch crew and office staff.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.480]   I wouldn't trade even one of my 25 employees
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.040]   and would be happy to have everybody here for the duration.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.680]   I am deliriously happily married and have been for the past 54 years.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.120]   My son lives just down the road and stops by to have a meal
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.240]   or visit with his mother and me in most days.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.440]   I have two non-related grandchildren, we assumed grandparenthood for from their birth,
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.160]   one in grade school and one about to finish college
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.440]   and we've been blessed through the years to spend a lot of time with them.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.920]   The list of people I could call to come and help me
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.160]   if I ran my car in the ditch at midnight is quite long and at least in my opinion.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.400]   The guys in my band all play much better than I do,
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.160]   always giving me challenges to respond to and mountains to climb in my profession.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.720]   I love my church, my pastor is my favorite preacher
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.720]   and the people who go there are friendly and loving.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.120]   I am born again not by anything I've ever done or ever will do
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.840]   but by the blood of Jesus who promises us an eternal home,
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.840]   a place of indescribable joy.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.080]   I would not change my doorstep one foot in any direction,
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.720]   living on the exact and only location on earth I feel at home at.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.440]   There are good riding horses, fat Hereford cattle in the pastures,
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.800]   big bass in the pond, squirrels in the hickory trees
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.200]   and Whitedale deer frolicking in the backwoods.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.080]   Hazel's flowers bloom every spring,
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.440]   there's a big hill in front of the house and a creek at the edge of the property.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.720]   We can hear bullfrogs, whippoorwills and the horses nickering on a soft summer evening
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.800]   and a full moon reflecting in the big pond at the bottom of the hill
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.240]   just kind of takes your breath away.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.000]   I have a head full of musical ideas
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.960]   and I've even had thoughts of someday writing a symphony.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.280]   To say I've been blessed is a gross understatement
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.080]   but enumerating my blessings for the world to see is not the purpose of this piece.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.320]   The real point is I know there are many people who look forward to retirement
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.040]   and would heartily encourage to go forth on those golden paths and relish your newfound freedom.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.520]   But for those of you who, despite your advanced years,
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.920]   still have a fire in your belly and unaccomplished goals,
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.720]   don't let a chronological number keep you from relishing the remaining years of your life.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.200]   From where I stand I say go for it.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.680]   What do you think?
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.680]   Pray for our troops, our police and the police of Jerusalem.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.680]   God bless America.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.680]   Charlie Daniels.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.480]   And when I read essays like that,
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.760]   I think about what's involved.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.680]   When an author sits down and reflects on their 82nd birthday,
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.400]   what do they choose to write about? What's important to them?
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.920]   And of course, since I think a lot about money, I always look to notice
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.960]   how does money play a role?
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.800]   Now, don't mistake me.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.040]   Money is important.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.880]   It's very important.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.040]   And somebody like Charlie Daniels, who is an accomplished and
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.400]   well-known famous musician, I assume and I hope that he's exceedingly rich.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.120]   He certainly had a long and successful career in his chosen genres of music.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.600]   I hope that he is massively prosperous.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.480]   But you notice that many of the things that he writes about aren't specifically related to money.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.480]   The closest he gets in this little essay to talking about money
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.440]   is in reflecting then the place that he lives.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.240]   The fact that he lives on a beautiful ranch with good riding horses and fat cattle
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.080]   in the pastures and bass in the pond and squirrels in the hickory trees
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.280]   and a beautiful creek at the edge of the property.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.920]   Well, that's great.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.640]   And he has it takes money to buy a ranch.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.280]   But I know a lot of people who live in such beautiful places
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.360]   and don't have a lot of money.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.640]   You don't have to have tens of millions of dollars from a successful
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.040]   international music career in order to enjoy those things.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:15.360]   So in just a moment, I want to give you six things for you to keep in mind
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.280]   that stand out to me just about things that lead to a life well-lived,
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.840]   six areas of goal setting.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.400]   But I want to contrast this with a movie that I've just been watching this week.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.720]   As you may hear, my voice is quite weak and my family and I, we've
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.760]   we've all been sick the last few days and it's been, of course, quite the adventure.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.640]   Parents have been there when, when you've got mom and dad both sick and you've
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.640]   got three children all with snotty noses and, and sore throats, et cetera.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.400]   It's been one of those, one of those weeks, which is challenging.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.680]   And especially when you're living in a little RV and in the middle
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.720]   of nowhere, it's it's challenging.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.000]   But because of being sick, I've slowed down a little bit and I made some
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.160]   time to watch a couple of movies.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.640]   And one of the movies that I have been watching is the Godfather.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:07.480]   Now the Godfather is, I know of course, a well-known movie, probably everyone in
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.800]   the world other than me has seen it.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.880]   Uh, I'm generally, however, a pop culture ignoramus.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.200]   And the only way that I really come into contact with much of pop culture is by
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.320]   friends who, upon finding out about my ignorance, say, no, Joshua, you need to
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.240]   watch this.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:27.040]   And so before leaving on a trip, a friend of mine gave, uh, gave me the trilogy
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.840]   of the Godfather one, two, and three.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.600]   And my wife and I have watched, um, movies number one and two.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.760]   We haven't gotten to number three.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.440]   Well, I was reflecting on that and I'll, by the way, spoiler alert, I assume I'm
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.000]   the last person in the world who hasn't seen these movies, but in thinking about
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.280]   how utterly dark the Godfather one and two are just how utterly depressing, um,
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.800]   the man, the protagonists, life's lives are, and who knows, maybe there's a
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.840]   redemption story and, um, number three, but I'm not really expecting it at this
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.080]   point.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.480]   And again, we'll see when I, when I, when I finish it, but I was just reflecting
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:09.000]   on what an awful, awful life these men put together.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.240]   Now, of course, the script writers create empathy in you for some of, uh, you know,
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.600]   for the conditions and the experiences that lead these men to choose such evil
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.200]   paths.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.240]   But when you look at the reality of their life, I mean, we just finished last
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:31.320]   night, Godfather two, and you think about the protagonist who, uh, not only, um,
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:37.160]   has, you know, he murders his brother-in-law, uh, he murders his own
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.920]   brother, uh, in addition to the scores of other people that he murders to advance
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.480]   his career, his wife murders their baby to get even with him because she doesn't
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.200]   want to, uh, she doesn't want to carry their baby.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   And it goes on and on and on.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.200]   It's just evil and dark and awful.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.600]   And yet the man is obviously wealthy.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:07.040]   And yet the wealth that comes with it is so tainted and so destroyed that
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.160]   there's no possibility for happiness.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:16.360]   You have a family's destroyed by decisions.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.960]   Now in life, we reap what we sow.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.960]   And so if you sow evil decisions, you reap evil, but if you sow wise
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.720]   decisions, you reap wisdom.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:30.960]   So let me give you just six examples that I reflected on from this Charlie
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.400]   Daniels piece that just made me think.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.840]   And again, when you, when you put it up against the foil of protagonists, like
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:44.240]   the Godfather, uh, it's stunning just to see the difference that life choices make.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.240]   So first, first thing I noticed in Charlie Daniels 82nd birthday reflection
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:55.360]   is this, one of the things to cultivate and appreciate is physical health that
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.520]   allows you to keep going into old age.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:03.240]   If you don't have physical health that allows you to maintain yourself and
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:08.200]   maintain your career, maintain your body, maintain your relationships, then it's
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.960]   hard to look forward to old age.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.560]   So there are decisions that we can make today that will help us to maintain
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.760]   physical health so that we can keep going into old age.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.800]   Some of those decisions have to do with the things that we're lectured on
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.920]   constantly with regard to medical choices.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.640]   Some of those decisions are things that are related to our career.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.600]   For example, one of the things that I'm convinced of is we should try to choose
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.720]   careers that we can do for the longterm.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.200]   That means that you're probably not going to choose a career that is
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.160]   physically destructive of your body.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.200]   Because if you choose a career that's physically destructive of your body, you
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.960]   start to reach around 45, 50 years old, and you start to thinking about retiring.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.800]   Now, maybe you can transition to something else, but it's much wiser to
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.760]   think about what is a career that I could do until I'm a hundred.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.320]   And if possible, if you have the opportunity, choose a career that will
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:06.920]   allow you to stay involved in it for a very long time and to whatever extent
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.840]   you can influence it and control it, maintain physical health so that you
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.520]   can keep going into old age.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:18.520]   Number two, choose a career that fascinates you and will allow you for
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.120]   the opportunity for constant and never ending growth and improvement.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.480]   If you notice in what somebody like Charlie Daniels says, and there are many
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.720]   examples that you can find of this.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.720]   This was just one that stumbled across my desk.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.880]   And if you notice one of the hallmarks of a good career is something that allows
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:41.360]   you to keep growing where you don't get stale, something that you can do that
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.080]   will allow you to continually get better.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.960]   Now that may be a craft that you can improve.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.240]   Maybe it's better results.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.080]   There are lots of ways in which you can embrace that principle, but find a
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:57.760]   career that will be fascinating for you for the longterm, and that will allow
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:03.040]   for constant and never ending growth and improvement so that you will never
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.400]   be the best that you could be.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.160]   Because if you do that, it'll keep your interest.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:17.240]   Now, additionally, look for a career that has seasons of life, times of
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.520]   hustle and work and times of rest, because we need both of those things.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.800]   If you live a sedentary and restful life all the time, you don't have the
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.400]   opportunity to experience the joy of accomplishment and achievement and
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.960]   the joy of challenge and busyness.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.400]   But on the other hand, if you choose a career that's always hustle and
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.160]   bustle and never has rest, you never get a chance to recharge.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.520]   And so the best model is to have something that has times of hustle
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:51.280]   and effort and hard work and times of rest and relaxation, and
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.640]   to build those into your life.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.400]   Choose a career that provides you with excellent financial income.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.200]   I don't think it has to be millions, but it's got to be excellent
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.040]   because that income goes far.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.800]   It allows you to consistently move yourself out of the things that
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.280]   you're not well suited to.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.120]   And it consistently allows you to do the things that you really love.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.960]   If you study the career paths of musicians, there are a lot of really
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:21.600]   excellent musicians who in the beginning years of their careers are absolutely
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:27.640]   drowned in the minutia of administrative scheduling and managing their careers.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:34.080]   I've not spoken to many musicians who would want to continue that for 60 years.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:40.440]   It's hard to think of an 82 year old musician who would still be enthusiastic
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.720]   about picking up the phone and calling venues and figuring out all
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.440]   of the details of ticket sales.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:51.120]   But if you'll choose a career that provides you with good income potential,
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:56.040]   then you can focus on those things that you're uniquely skilled at, such
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.440]   as playing music or writing songs, those things that give you joy.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.680]   Some people find joy in the administrative minutia.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.240]   And some people find joy in writing songs.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.680]   And so one of the benefits of choosing a career that has high financial
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:17.480]   prospects is you can continually hire out the things that you're not skilled
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.840]   at, which leaves you just the opportunity to focus on those things
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.600]   that you are most skilled at.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:28.720]   Final point on careers, work with people you like and enjoy being together with,
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.600]   and especially work with people that make you better.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.080]   Don't be the most competent person in your sphere of influence.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.120]   Work with people that make you better.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.840]   So you are stretching and growing and learning and progressing.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:49.040]   When Daniels writes about his crew and his band members and the people who he
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.240]   enjoys being with, that's important because life is a journey together with
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:59.920]   other people, and if you'll be challenged by the people around you, then you'll
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.600]   continue to enjoy growth.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.480]   So first was physical health that allows you to keep going into old age.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:11.160]   Second component of a life well lived, at least from this analysis is a career
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.720]   that fascinates and allows for constant and never ending growth and improvement.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.840]   Number three, rich, loving, peaceful family relationships and friendships.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.880]   I repeat rich, loving, peaceful family relationships and friendships.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.600]   When you look at the things that people tend to be doing, they're
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.400]   people tend to most appreciate in life.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:40.080]   As they get older, you find that people focus more and more on relationships.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:45.720]   This struck me in watching the first of the Godfather movies where the
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.760]   protagonist, the elder Godfather, here he is at the end of his life and the
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.280]   twilight of his years, and what is he taking joy in?
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.920]   Playing in the garden with his grandson, playing silly games.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.840]   Everything else is stripped away.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:09.280]   Relationships matter, but you have to invest in those relationships because
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:16.680]   if you think about relationships of joy versus relationships of pain, consider
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.400]   again, the plot of these Godfather movies that I've been watching.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:27.840]   Imagine the pain of watching your eldest son be murdered for your own actions.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:34.200]   Imagine the pain of watching your other children fight and quarrel with another.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.880]   Imagine the pain if you're aware of it, of knowing that one of your
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.840]   sons murdered his brother-in-law.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:47.840]   Imagine the pain if you knew of it, of knowing that one of your sons murdered
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:54.520]   the other and knowing at the end of the line, you'll have one son, your
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:58.560]   youngest, who's basically murdered everyone else in their family.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:07.160]   If you were aware of that as an elderly grandparent, it wouldn't bring much
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:13.160]   peace to your life, so cultivate rich, loving, peaceful family relationships
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:13.960]   and friendships.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:19.560]   Number four, live in a place that you love, live in your dream location,
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:27.000]   whatever that is, live in a place that you love because the small joys of being
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.800]   in a place that you love will accumulate over time, will lead to a sense of
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.680]   satisfaction.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:38.120]   Now, this is the only thing on my list of six that requires money.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:46.600]   And what's interesting, if you do all these things, you could actually get
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.240]   away with never becoming wealthy.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.520]   For example, if you were still working and earning income, you could always
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.440]   just live on that income.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.320]   You wouldn't need to save money to be financially independent.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.600]   If you had a career that fascinated you and fed your soul and allowed you to
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:06.240]   be, use areas of your life that you're skillful, doing work that you care
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.720]   about with people that you like.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:12.640]   If you were to pursue that, you could continue doing that for a long time.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.360]   You wouldn't ever have to freak out about quitting.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.680]   You don't need a lot of money for that.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.200]   If you're building rich, loving, peaceful family relationships and
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.760]   friendships, that doesn't cost a lot of money.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.760]   You can certainly invest some money into a nice Thanksgiving day spread and some
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.920]   nice family vacations.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.320]   And it's nice to be able to take the whole family on a cruise, but you can take the
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.680]   whole family to a national park.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.240]   You can take the whole family on a cruise.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:41.400]   With one choice, you'll spend a thousand bucks for a week.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.880]   And with another choice, you'll spend 8,000 bucks for a week.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:50.000]   Both of those can build rich family relationships.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.360]   The only one of these things that takes money is living in a place that you love.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.400]   Now stop and think about this for a moment.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:04.960]   If you could today clarify what living in a place that you love looks like.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:14.960]   And if you could arrange to buy such a place and be there, be there for the long
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:21.440]   term, you can afford to live in a place that you love.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.040]   Whether it's a beautiful ranch, whether it's a penthouse condo.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:34.400]   If you got to buy a place for a million bucks, your dream place, and you finance
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.120]   it over 30 or 40 years, and you just make that payment every year for 30 or 40 years,
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.200]   and you stay there, the end of the day, you get to live there for 30, 40 years, and
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.960]   you get to continue living there and enjoying it.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.960]   Even when the mortgage is paid off.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:53.080]   Most people, if they would choose a place that they love and set up a household and
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.760]   stay there, they could afford to live in their dream location.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:01.120]   It's the constant movement that is very draining on your expenses.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.880]   So think about what a place that you love might look like.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.080]   Do your very best to live there in your dream location.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.920]   Whatever that is.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.080]   If you like to hear your horses nickering on a soft summer evening, if you'd like
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.680]   to look down at the full moon reflecting in the big pond at the bottom of the hill,
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.920]   build that.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.240]   Doesn't cost that much.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:28.080]   Number five, spiritual peace and harmony.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:35.760]   If you can find a place of stability and find spiritual peace in your life, be at
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:41.840]   harmony, understand what you believe and why, and achieve that sense of peace, that
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.280]   peace pervades your life.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.600]   It's an important component of a life well lived.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.520]   And finally, number six, a vision for the future.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.160]   Vision for the future is one of those things that will keep you young.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.080]   Always make your future bigger than your past.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.720]   Don't look back to the good old days.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:08.960]   Rather forget those things that are behind and press forward to the things that are
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.000]   ahead, to the upward call of the vision that you have set for yourself.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:19.600]   Vision for the future pulls you forward and keeps you young, keeps you engaged.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:30.160]   It's a far richer life in my opinion, then the life of saving up a bunch of money and
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:30.480]   quitting.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:35.680]   I hope this is useful to you.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:43.400]   Whatever you choose to do with your life is up to you, but think about it and read
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:48.960]   about what other people have to say when they're older and set your course, because
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.960]   whatever you set your course to, you'll probably achieve it.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:59.200]   You set your course to be the number one mafia kingpin, wipe out all of your
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.400]   competition, you'll probably do it.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:05.080]   If you set your course to have another kind of life, you'll probably do that.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:10.280]   Whatever you sow now, that's what you're going to reap in the long term.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.960]   My voice is about shot.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.360]   I'm glad I got through this.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.000]   I had to pause a couple of times to cough.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   I'm going to close out just for fun.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.400]   I'll play for you my personal, my personal favorite Charlie Daniels song.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:27.200]   It's an old song called "Hi Lonesome" and it puts a picture, it always has put a
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.960]   picture in my head of something that I personally desire.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.080]   Like music has a way of doing that to you.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:40.400]   And so I hope you enjoy this and go forth and think about those things that, those
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.680]   decisions that you can make.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.400]   Remember those decisions are probably not going to be limited by money.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.360]   Choose to build physical health that will keep you going into old age.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.920]   Choose a career that fascinates and allows for constant and never ending
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.920]   growth and improvement.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:57.280]   Build rich, loving, peaceful family relationships and deep enduring
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.080]   friendships.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:03.320]   Live in a place that you love and pursue spiritual peace and harmony in your life
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.840]   and develop a vision for the future.

[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:40.720]   [Instrumental]
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   Just you and me and a little white pup
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.720]   Sitting here waiting for the sun to come up
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:54.720]   Keepin' chill away
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   Drinking our coffee at the first crack of dawn
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   Watching a doe while she nuzzles her phone
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   It's my favorite time of day
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   I long so
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:29.720]   God don't ever let this mountain change
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:38.720]   I long so
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   I hope you'll always stay the same
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   Sometimes in the evening when it's all kinda still
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:56.720]   Sweet mountain music floats over the hill
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.720]   For tomorrow's sitting breeze
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:08.720]   Sometimes when the night birds are scolding the mist
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.720]   I think I might know where heaven is
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:18.720]   It's just above the trees
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:28.720]   I long so
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   God don't ever let this mountain change
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:45.720]   I long so
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   I hope you'll always stay the same

[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:56.720]   [Instrumental]
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.720]   Watching my summer times turn into falls
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   Seeing my son growing honest and tall
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.720]   Keeps me satisfied
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   If I live forever or I die today
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.720]   All I would ask is you just let me lay here
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:28.720]   On this mountainside
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   I long so
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:45.720]   I long so
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:55.720]   I long so
