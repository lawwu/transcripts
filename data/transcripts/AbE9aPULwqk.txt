[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   I'm trying to decide whether a ditch postpone a side hustle idea in order
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.760]   not to overwhelm myself versus adopting a slow part productivity mindset
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.140]   and see how progress compounds over time.
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.060]   So, Jonas, what you need is extreme clarity.
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.600]   And this is where the productivity perspective is going to help you.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.640]   You have to get your arms around the job that's making you feel busy right now.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.060]   Capture, configure, control.
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.000]   See where you can get that.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.240]   You reduce the stress, take control of your time,
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.800]   begin with the configure step to be more aggressive about workload management.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.300]   See where you can get that line in a place that's allowing you to do
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.640]   what you need to do without feeling overwhelmed and then.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.080]   Step back and say, where would the side hustle fit
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.040]   and answer that question honestly?
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.600]   And now, Jonas, knowing what I know about you, because in your elaboration,
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.100]   you talked a little bit more about your busyness and you have a lot of going
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.000]   a lot of things going on with your family and young kids.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.780]   When you step back, you might say.
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.400]   There is not time for me to execute a reasonable plan for this side hustle.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.480]   And you know what? That's fine. Don't do the side hustle.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.940]   But you're going to get that answer with clarity.
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.580]   Or after you capture, configure, control, you might really tame your job.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.680]   And so you know what? I could work on this two days a week,
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.080]   three hours in the morning is my remote work days.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.340]   Nothing really gets going until noon or whatever.
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.500]   And this would allow me and here's my plan.
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.480]   And I could actually make pretty good progress on this.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.340]   And then you might find like, OK, now I see exactly where I'm going to work on this.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.000]   And I'm looking at exactly I'm going to work on this.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.540]   And this is enough time.
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.380]   And this is worth it enough to me. Let's do it.
[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.200]   But you cannot get to these answers with confidence
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.940]   unless you really know what's going on with your current work obligations.
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.480]   And so that's what I want you to do.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.800]   Pull out, capture, configure, control until you are a master of your job,
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.080]   then work through what are the reasonable scenarios
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.800]   for me to make progress on the side hustle and evaluate those.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.880]   Will it work? And is it worth it?
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.800]   Is where the achievement, the side hustle will generate,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.440]   is it worth it for what I would have to do and be very honest with you, answer it.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.680]   And especially at this stage of life, you have young kids at home.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.200]   It's completely fine for your answer there to be.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.040]   No, it's not worth it.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.600]   I've controlled my job. I like having this flexibility.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.800]   I want to just use this to do more things in my family or a hobby.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.080]   I think that's a completely reasonable solution as well.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.180]   But you don't get those options until you know what's going on.
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.980]   You're just haphazardly busy. Good luck.
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.340]   You're just going to start doing the side hustle that in a way
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.340]   that you don't have time for this going to cause stress.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.940]   You're going to let it peter out.
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.340]   So, again, the productivity perspective here says once you have control,
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.740]   you get autonomy. Autonomy gives you options.
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.680]   I actually thought when I first read the question, I thought that he had already
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.540]   started the side hustle and, you know, was working on it for a while.
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.840]   And then, you know, it's a little hard to tell.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.480]   I read the longer one.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.640]   He talked a lot about the various things that were.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.740]   He was worried about, like his busyness.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.400]   And there definitely was a sense of haphazard busyness.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.140]   Yeah, but it was a little unclear if he had started
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.740]   and was feeling overwhelmed by it already, or if he was pretty sure
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.640]   that if I just started this, I'd feel overwhelmed.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.040]   I mean, the slow productivity approach, it can work with a side hustle,
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.500]   but you really got to evaluate it.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.900]   Right. So you could say, like, at some point, it's too slow.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.500]   If it's I'm going to work once a month, I'm going to have an hour session.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.280]   Like that's too slow. Yeah.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.140]   I mean, to me, slow productivity also involves obsessing over quality.
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.740]   It also involves the reduction of things.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.400]   You can give more attention to something.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.140]   It's not just about you can fit another thing into your schedule,
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.700]   because if you stretch it out long enough,
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.900]   you can find little pockets of time to make progress.
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.040]   I mean, slow productivity is it's a lot of it's about simplification.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.280]   So it can take more of your attention.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.640]   Yeah. Obsession over quality so that you can really come at it again and again.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.540]   I think just trying to spread something out.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.180]   So you touch it here and there.
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.740]   It's not really a slow, productive approach.
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.280]   I think it's just a fragmented approach. Yeah.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.880]   Yeah. All right. Let's try to fit in one more question here.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.740]   All right. Next question is from Andrew, 51 year old biology professor.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.820]   I'm a professor because research production is not a shared goal.
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.980]   I have difficulty getting my colleagues to think creatively about system changes,
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.280]   even if we might benefit from it all.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.240]   It's always easier to do what is easiest in the immediate moment.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.280]   Other folks productivity be damned. What should I do?
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.920]   Well, I include this question in part just because I like professor questions,
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.240]   but it's another good example for us to apply the productivity perspective.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.620]   So what Andrew's talking about is the type of collaboration systems
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.620]   I detail and motivate in my book, A World Without Email,
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.280]   where I talk about in the knowledge work context.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.840]   There's many informal collaboration styles that are built mainly around
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.980]   haphazard back and forth messaging that are actually really unproductive
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.380]   for everyone involved in the long term, even though in the moment
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.580]   it's easier just to shoot off a quick email than it is to actually implement
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.740]   some sort of collaboration system like whatever.
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.120]   There's a shared document where the thoughts go.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.680]   And on Monday night, I review that and then I put the notes using track changes.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.020]   And you have till Wednesday, close a business to react to them.
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.140]   And then we have a standing meeting on Thursday morning.
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.540]   Those type of systems get you away from constant back and forth messaging.
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.140]   But they're a little bit more work in the moment.
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.940]   Andrew is saying, I can't get fellow professors to do this
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.240]   because we're not all working towards the shared same goal.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.680]   It's not everyone in my department is working on getting this new product out.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.040]   We're each working on our own thing.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.620]   And so we're not that interested in being
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.040]   collectively focused on improving how we collaborate.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.140]   So, Andrew, my productivity perspective here is you have to shift
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.820]   the scope that you're thinking about productivity.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.180]   If you are a professor at a research institution,
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.780]   you need to think about yourself as a standalone business
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.040]   and the other professors in your department and other professors
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.280]   that you interact with and other departments,
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.040]   you know, the H.R. department, the whatever, like other whatever
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.720]   you would call them, groups within university, like their own businesses
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.680]   with which you have various professional relationships.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.240]   You're Ford and you work with Firestone Tires,
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.020]   they're two separate businesses, but you know, you guys have a contract
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.320]   and a relationship to get the tires for your car manufacturing plant.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.720]   But you're not the same company.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.540]   So you have to think of yourself almost as like a standalone silo.
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.880]   So when you're thinking about systems internally is where you're really
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.540]   trying to get a handle on what is my work, what do I work on?
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.320]   What are my quotas? What do I not do?
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.580]   When do I get this work done?
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.040]   How much time do I have available?
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.480]   How do I want to use this time?
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.240]   And you're keeping track of all that and have all your complex systems.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.680]   Then when you're interacting with the rest of the world, it's well,
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.420]   you have sort of interfaces with interacting with these other standalone
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.620]   entities, and I don't know, they're bothering you with emails.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.080]   You could just do what you need to do with that.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.520]   Just process centric emailing might work there,
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.820]   where you never formally develop a new
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.620]   collaboration system with someone else.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.780]   You just sort of tell them in your response.
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.420]   Yeah, great. We should think about this.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.320]   Put any thoughts you have in this Google Doc that I started.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.520]   I will review it if I have any questions because you're a professor.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.380]   I know you have clearly posted office hours.
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.720]   I will actually just come to your office hours next week and we'll talk about it.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.160]   Let's sort of put a process into the communication.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.720]   And there it is. You're not calling it a process.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.880]   You're not negotiating about it. You're just saying it.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.220]   Certain types of work like this is very disruptive.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.280]   This person just constantly wants to email things.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.480]   OK, I'm not doing that.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.560]   I'm not going to work on that person.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.420]   I'm going to leave that committee. You have all this autonomy.
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.720]   This is like a company saying we're going to get out of selling at souls
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.160]   because there's not a lot of profit there.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.560]   We're going to focus more on, you know, selling Ford focuses or whatever.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.220]   You think of yourself like a standalone business
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.420]   that interfaces with other organizations and you do your best
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.620]   to keep those interfaces as non disruptive as possible.
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.180]   So you need to be more ruthless, Andrew.
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.080]   That's, I guess, what I would say.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.220]   Your department is not your team members.
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.460]   They're your colleagues.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.380]   You're collegial to them.
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.880]   You enjoy them, but you're all your own standalone entities
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.620]   trying to figure out how to exist in the same academic sphere
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.380]   while still accomplishing your internal objectives.
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:17.520]   So I don't know, maybe it maybe I'm being a little bit Darwinian there,
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.320]   but I think it's the best academia really is.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.840]   It's entrepreneurial. Yeah.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.020]   You're trying to produce original research. That's the whole game.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.940]   If you don't, you get fired. That's the whole game.
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.140]   And you work with other people.
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.880]   There's other things you have to do and service you have to do.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.340]   But but it's just like Ford has these other things they have to do.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.480]   But ultimately, if they're not selling cars, they're out of business.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.880]   You kind of have to keep that in mind.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.320]   The five books I read in February 2023 as longtime listeners.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.740]   No, I try to read five books a month and I report on what those books
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.980]   are here on the podcast. All right.
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.480]   So what did I read in February?
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.880]   Number one, the Clockwork Universe by Edward Dolnick.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.920]   This was roughly speaking, a popular history
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.120]   of the Royal Society in London.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.080]   More generally speaking, it was a book about the rise
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.520]   of the Enlightenment scientific mindset.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.980]   So Dolnick makes this point, but a lot of other authors
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.180]   to make this point as well.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.280]   Isaac Newton was at a turning point.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.180]   Isaac Newton was born and came up in a world that was connected
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.680]   more to Greek thought and mythological thought.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.580]   And by the time he died, we were in a world
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.380]   that had a more empirical mathematical approach to understanding the world.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.780]   I love these type of histories.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.740]   It's a very readable book, short chapters.
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.540]   It moves pretty quick.
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.980]   Not as deep as some other histories I've read on this,
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.540]   but had a lot of good information.
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.680]   So a lot of London in this episode.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.640]   Yeah. Two questions from London.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.640]   A book about London. Yeah.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.140]   You know why? It's because I am that article we talked about last week.
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.880]   And oh, yeah, Times.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.880]   Obviously, that's a London based publication.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.340]   So last week I was killing it in the UK.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.340]   So this podcast, number one technology podcast in the UK,
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:08.080]   like number 30 overall podcast, you know, in the UK.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.620]   Deep Work at Amazon UK was ranked like 60.
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.840]   That's so good. Right.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.580]   So we've been killing in the UK.
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.380]   So as you can see, we're
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.480]   we're pushing all of our content to be UK centric.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.640]   A lot of good golf courses around London. Yes, true.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.640]   We need we need a podcast out of there.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.180]   All right. I also read Wandering Home by Bill McKibben.
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.580]   I read that years and years ago, but I had a copy of my library.
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.580]   So I went back and read it and loved it.
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:35.940]   Very nostalgic.
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.980]   I really remember reading that book in grad school.
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.120]   Bill McKibben, who I really like, I interviewed him for a New Yorker
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.580]   piece a couple of years ago.
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:49.080]   He wrote this cool book where he walked from his house in Ripton, Vermont,
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.680]   which is sort of one valley over from Lake Champlain in western Vermont
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.520]   to his house in the Adirondacks.
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.920]   So the McKibben story is that he quit the New Yorker
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.920]   and moved to a cabin.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.760]   It was really like a rundown house.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.580]   Him and his wife, Susan Halperin, who's an excellent journalist.
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.080]   They moved to this house in the Adirondacks.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.660]   And then once they had their kid, they decided they realized like
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.880]   kids need a school to go to.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.220]   So they moved across Lake Champlain to Ripton, Vermont,
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.820]   which I actually visited there last summer.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.120]   It's these cool it's one south of Lincoln.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.380]   It's these these cool green mountain towns that are up at elevation.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.960]   And really quaint.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.260]   Anyways, he walked from Ripton to the old house.
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.360]   He had a Rondex.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.260]   He had someone to roam across Lake Champaign, Champaign, Champlain.
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.360]   And in doing so, he got a he visited all these places and talked a lot about,
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.360]   you know, the type of things he writes about in deep, deep, deep economy
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:52.320]   that the book, deep economy, sustainable commercial endeavor, et cetera.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.260]   It was really cool book, really nostalgic.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.500]   Makes you want to just move to Vermont and drink Otter Creek beer
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.800]   and hang out at Middlebury.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.940]   I know the book I read, you'd appreciate this one, Jesse.
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.260]   America's Game by Michael McCambridge, the history of the NFL.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.740]   The long book, I read it for I'm in a
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.860]   a dad book group that only reads sports books.
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.400]   It's a lot of like journalists and stuff that we just don't want to.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.160]   We we don't want to read anything that's too close to our work.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.160]   Mm hmm.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.100]   Anything is too close to home.
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.600]   So we read sports books.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.240]   I like that. Yeah.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.840]   I know a lot about the history of the NFL now, at least up until 2005.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.440]   It's when this book came out in the early days, like back during Lombardi,
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.360]   the Canadian Football League was a big, you know,
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.460]   like it was a definite competitor, like people would go over there.
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.500]   And that's not mentioned at all in this book. Really? Yeah.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.200]   That's an ad.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.840]   His historian on early in the week, and they were actually talking about that
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.060]   because somebody died.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.500]   Michael McCambridge, man, you missed.
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.760]   You missed the big storyline here.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:59.600]   I also read a of the conquest of happiness by Bertrand Russell.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.540]   The philosopher, mathematician Bertrand Russell wrote this book.
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.900]   This would have been in like 19.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.800]   I think it's like 1919 or something like that.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.340]   Maybe 1930, somewhere in that period.
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.060]   Maybe a little later than that.
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.360]   I might be messing it up.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.160]   I mean, he died in the he died remarkably late.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.300]   He lived a long time.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.100]   I'm going to say the 1930s.
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.200]   It was there's a really nice new edition of this book
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.600]   that I found that Barnes and Noble and says, OK, I got to read this.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.760]   It's like a kind of like a self-help
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.960]   book, but written before people wrote self-help books
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.400]   and written by an eminent philosopher, mathematician.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.440]   And it's him trying to deconstruct and understand the
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.700]   the sources of human happiness, as well as the things that pull away
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.600]   from human happiness and trying to lay out some sort of program
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.940]   for how you can maximize it in your life.
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.100]   This is what philosophers used to do.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.500]   This is why I really dislike this tendency we have for,
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.260]   especially the very online types to be very dismissive about.
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.660]   Well, they're self-help.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.200]   They're a guru where you have to like throw this disclaimer
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.240]   at the front of everything you write.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.000]   We're like, oh, I'm no guru.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.240]   I'm not.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.460]   In fact, I'm I'm terrible and I'm I can barely walk and I'm not giving any advice.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.900]   And you really think people are going to applaud?
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.760]   Like there's all these gurus who are, you know, preying on people.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.500]   But look, it used to be professional thinkers and philosophers were like,
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.360]   this is one of the things I want to do is try to think through
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.200]   big questions from life and take my swing.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.600]   So good for Russell for doing it.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.900]   Very readable.
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.140]   There's some anachronisms in it, but actually otherwise reads as a pretty
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:28.940]   modern book.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.800]   A lot of similar concepts to the deep life stuff that you talk about.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.240]   There's some. Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.440]   I mean, I get like getting outside and just that stuff,
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.940]   but also a lot of psychological stuff like jealousy and pride
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.000]   and trying to understand.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.240]   It's interesting.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.440]   So it's kind of mental healthy.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.840]   A lot of it, the habits of mind that can really pull you down.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.600]   I mean, it actually reads pretty relevant, but it is an issue of mine.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.240]   Is this like.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.400]   I'm not impressed by people who have to put these long disclaimers about like,
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.600]   I'm not a guru who's going to tell you exactly how to live your life.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.500]   I mean.
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.180]   Where are these gurus who are trying to tell people exactly how to live their life?
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.500]   I think smart people should take swings at.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.740]   Here's a big question.
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.780]   Let me take a swing at like how you might answer it.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.240]   People are smart.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.500]   They will adapt it to their own circumstances.
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.640]   They will discount the obvious caveats.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.800]   This weird
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.580]   whatever it is.
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.600]   Negative reaction that sort of very online elite types have to.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.640]   Trying to be instructive or like to tackle big questions,
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.140]   I don't think it's I don't think it's healthy.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.440]   It's similar in sports, how they always say, oh, the naysayers say.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.940]   Yeah. XYZ.
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.700]   I think in online culture, it's very safe to be a naysayer
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.040]   because you'd be applauded for your world, weary critiques.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.440]   People like, oh, that's a good I didn't see that angle of critique.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.900]   And there's no real risk.
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.400]   Yeah. Being a little bit too critical.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.880]   I like, well, you know, sophisticated people are critical,
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.380]   but you're really opening yourself up if you say
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.340]   this is my thoughts about this or like this is my philosophy
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.400]   for how you should do something.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.340]   I mean, I think it's, you know, it's why I've sold a lot of books
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.840]   is because I'm not online, so I don't care.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.380]   Since like, look, I think this is interesting.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.440]   I loved reading this stuff.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.940]   I love books like Bertrand Russell's Conquest of Happiness.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.080]   Like, let's just get after it.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.840]   And I don't care.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.540]   So I guess more books for me, if everyone else is afraid of it.
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.180]   A lot of smart people who could be writing really interesting, cool,
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.740]   reflective books aren't because they don't want to get yelled out on Twitter.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.080]   So, hey, more books for us.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.280]   Final book I read,
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.440]   part of us kind of a holdover from Thriller December Rising Sun by Michael
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.340]   Crichton.
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:38.440]   I'm sure I read that at some point when I was a kid, but I found the paperback
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.840]   in a newspaper back, and so I read it.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.140]   Well, constructed sort of murder mystery thriller.
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.540]   It's two detectives.
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:49.240]   They made a movie about this with Sean Connery and.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.400]   God, who was the other person was it Wesley Snipes?
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.700]   I think it was. I saw that movie like 30 years ago.
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.840]   Yeah. I have to go back and watch the movie.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:01.180]   I mean, essentially, there it's it's a detective thriller.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.300]   These are detectives and they're trying to figure out a murder.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.500]   And then there's some like Crichton high tech stuff.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.680]   The thing I I didn't really realize this about Crichton until more recently.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.740]   He got really reactionary.
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.400]   This is like a pretty like reactionary kind of anti Japanese book.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.780]   Oh, really? Yeah.
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:23.240]   Like you're very worried, clearly very worried about the economic influence
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.240]   of at the then, I guess, the Japan had this massive, like outsize
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.540]   economic influence.
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.540]   Not very nice to Japanese people.
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:31.900]   I'm thinking about disclosure.
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.400]   I'm thinking about state of fear.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.200]   I was like, oh, he kind of became curmudgeonly his 90s.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.580]   So it's it is pretty reactionary.
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.200]   He just works this stuff into his book.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.300]   But but still a good murder.
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.980]   Good murder mystery.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.780]   But, you know, it's interesting layer.
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.900]   Any of these books, audio?
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.740]   I'm sure they're all. No, none of these were audio.
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.880]   So you read them all? I read them all.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.400]   Yeah. Yeah, I've been doing a lot of audio books recently.
