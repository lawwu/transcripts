[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   The following is a conversation with Michael Malice
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.840]   and Yaron Brook, Michael's third time on this podcast
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.240]   and Yaron's second, but together for the first time.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.400]   Michael is an anarchist, political thinker,
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.820]   host of a podcast called "You're Welcome"
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.600]   and author of "Dear Reader, The New Right"
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.640]   and two upcoming books,
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.680]   "Anarchist Handbook" and "The White Pill".
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.640]   Yaron is an objectivist philosopher,
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.120]   chairman of the Ayn Rand Institute,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.880]   host of the Yaron Brook Show
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.200]   and co-author of "The Free Market Revolution"
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.120]   and "Equal is Unfair".
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.840]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.960]   Ground News, Public Goods, Athletic Greens,
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.520]   Brave and Four Sigmatic.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.080]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.280]   As a side note, let me say that this conversation
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.200]   is a kind of experiment.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.340]   Both Michael and Yaron are thoughtful and passionate,
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.500]   united in part by an interest in the history
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.480]   and philosophy of Ayn Rand,
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.400]   but they are also very different in style.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.120]   Good conversation, like good food,
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.320]   is often made delicious by pairing of contrasting elements.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.000]   For example, someone suggested I try a peanut butter,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.360]   bacon and banana sandwich, which apparently is very good.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.040]   Among the three of us, I don't know who's the peanut butter,
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.560]   who's the bacon and who's the banana.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.560]   I'm guessing it's probably me, I'm the banana.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.640]   But I hope the final result, the final dish, if you will,
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.600]   is equally delicious.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.720]   We talked through, I think, a lot of interesting ideas,
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.760]   sometimes disagreeing, sometimes even in rare cases,
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.960]   saying something humorous, including dark humor,
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.840]   especially in Michael's case.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.920]   All three of us are sensitive to the suffering
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.660]   in the world today and throughout human history.
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.120]   We think about it, we talk about it,
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.440]   and we deal with it in different ways.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.920]   Be patient with us.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.800]   Whether you agree, disagree, enjoy or dislike the result,
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.360]   I hope if you listen, you're a wiser person
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.800]   on the other end of it.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.160]   I know I was.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.560]   Mostly, I really enjoyed this conversation
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.000]   because no matter what Michael and Yaron believe,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.960]   underneath it all, they're genuine, kind human beings
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.180]   that I'm lucky to be able to hang out with and learn from.
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.800]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.560]   and here's my conversation
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.420]   with Michael Malice and Yaron Brooke.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.900]   - I've been a huge fan of the two of you
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.840]   for the longest time.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.680]   - Are we recording now?
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.720]   Is it starting?
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.720]   Or are you just talking?
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.000]   - I'm not recording at all.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.480]   - He's not gonna compliment us if it's not part of the show.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.800]   - Yes, he does, all the time.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.140]   He speaks very highly of me.
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.980]   You, I don't know.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.240]   Maybe he's being charitable.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.600]   - He only does this to me on the show.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600]   - Objectivists don't like charity, so don't compliment him.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.040]   He won't think it's sincere.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.000]   - There you go.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.200]   - So it's an incredible honor
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.260]   that the both of you would show up here.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.380]   If we, let me just ask this sort of
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.480]   profound philosophical question.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.860]   How well do you think we would get along
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.260]   if we were stuck in a desert island together?
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.460]   What would life be like?
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.020]   - I thought the original question you had,
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.180]   that you sent us this question,
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.420]   was how long would it take for us to murder one another,
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.260]   or something like that.
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.620]   There was murder in the question, if I remember.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.580]   - I, listen, he sent us homework, right,
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.420]   all these questions.
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.240]   - I ignored it.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.700]   - I didn't spend four years at Patrick Henry University
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.680]   to do homework.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.040]   To answer your question,
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.980]   I think it would be very easy
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.800]   for us to live together in a desert island
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.880]   in terms of interpersonal.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.040]   I know, and I say this because I know a lot of people
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.360]   who have been the show's survivor.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.760]   So they, and I know a little bit about the dynamics.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.600]   So when you have people who are intelligent,
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.640]   who are gonna have the same goals,
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.880]   I mean, and there's space to go away if I'm annoyed at you,
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.800]   I don't think it would be that hard at all.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.400]   - What's our goals on a desert island?
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.640]   - Food, shelter.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.480]   - Survival.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.300]   - Survival, yeah.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.140]   - Survival, basically.
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.360]   - And getting out of there, right?
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.760]   You don't wanna stay on the desert island.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.560]   So yeah, I don't think,
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.840]   I think that's true of any three,
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.960]   you know, semi-rational people who, you know,
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.020]   who basically share the goal that they wanna survive,
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.640]   they wanna thrive, they wanna get off of the island.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.240]   Why would there be conflict?
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.080]   - Yeah.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.920]   - Well, I mean, there would be conflict,
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.360]   but, and there can be conflict,
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.160]   but they'd find ways to deal with it.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.440]   I don't have this negative view of human beings,
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.880]   particularly not as individuals.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.040]   It's when they get into mobs and groups and collectives
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.060]   that ideology can really motivate them
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.260]   to do horrible things.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.520]   - One of the things that really drives me crazy
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.460]   is how sinister an impact the book "Lord of the Flies"
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.040]   has had on our culture.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.000]   I read it in high school.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.420]   It's a superb book, that's not even a question,
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.760]   but it's not accurate.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.580]   We see in many situations where people are trapped together
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.040]   under difficult circumstances,
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.780]   obviously that book's about children,
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.980]   that very quickly, it is not about conflict.
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.820]   It very quickly becomes about cooperation.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.760]   Let's work together.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.940]   We all have the same goal.
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.260]   This is not a time to worry about other things.
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.000]   It really, the human beings,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.380]   the animal instinct that kicks in is the social animal,
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.600]   and I'm gonna shut up and go over there
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.580]   and have a, like, stomp my feet
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.980]   instead of arguing with your own
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.580]   because we're really trapped in the situation
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.820]   and we need to make it work.
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.500]   - Well, and to the extent that they're bad people,
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.820]   bad people are dealt with, right?
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.780]   So this is true of all of, you know,
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.340]   how did we survive as a species, right?
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.540]   How have we survived as a species?
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.220]   We've been on a desert island, in a sense,
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.020]   as a species forever.
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.940]   Tribes survive.
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.420]   They survive by cooperation.
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.420]   They survive by dealing with bad people.
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.820]   Civilization is created by people cooperating
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.140]   and working together and allowing individuals
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.860]   to thrive within the group,
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.660]   and when bad people arise, they deal with them, right?
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.660]   They now, sometimes these groups get captured by bad people,
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.460]   right, and bad ideas,
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.460]   and probably from day one that was going on, right,
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.100]   the whole tribe is probably a bad idea to begin with,
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.260]   but underneath it all,
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.780]   the fact is that to survive as a species,
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.980]   we need to think, we need to be rational,
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.500]   and if we don't have any respect for reason,
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.580]   then we would all die.
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.700]   We would die off.
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.500]   - So that's a hopeful message,
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.860]   but where does that go wrong?
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.340]   So with three people, we might get along.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.020]   We would focus on the basics of life.
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.420]   We have similar goals.
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.340]   - Once women are introduced,
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.020]   they're incessant irrationalism.
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.860]   - No, no.
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.020]   - And less of their hormones, or SOL.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.740]   - Look, three of us on a desert island would be nice,
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.020]   but without women, it wouldn't be fun.
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.860]   - I'm gonna edit out half the things Michael said
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.900]   through this broadcast.
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.020]   - As you know, I used to run the Ayn Rand Institute.
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.780]   She was a woman last time I looked.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.140]   - Oh, wait a minute.
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.420]   You know exactly what I'm gonna say.
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.580]   When Ludwig von Mises, or Hazlitt,
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.940]   I forget who it was, Mises, was praising Ayn Rand,
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.260]   and I think it was Hazlitt who said it to her.
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.220]   He said, "Ludwig von Mises said,
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.100]   "you're the smartest man I've ever met."
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.700]   And Ayn Rand said, "Did he say man?"
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.540]   Right?
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.500]   - No, she viewed it as a compliment.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.860]   - Right, but she wanted to be clear that he said man.
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:01.700]   She was excited, yes.
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.540]   - Absolutely.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.940]   - She was excited, but she was.
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.380]   - I took it as her perceiving him
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.940]   as seeing her as a full equal.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.180]   - Oh, I think that's right.
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.020]   I think that's right.
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.460]   Plus, I think the perception out there,
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.140]   the perception and the culture of men as being rational
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.980]   was a compliment to her.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.820]   - And this is also--
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.860]   - Because that was affirming that he viewed her as a rational.
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.420]   - Yeah, 'cause Mises is old school.
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.380]   He's an older Eastern European guy,
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.300]   so he would definitely have these rigid views.
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.420]   Like his wife, I read her autobiography,
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.620]   Marguerite von Mises,
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.740]   and basically he made her his secretary
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.060]   to the point where if he's typing something,
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.460]   or he had something handwritten, she had to type it out,
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.500]   and if she made a typo, he would tear up the page.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.620]   She had to start from the beginning,
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.580]   but it's like this is the role of the man,
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.420]   this is the role of the woman.
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.980]   So for him to regard her,
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.460]   this was kind of a breaking through moment,
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.020]   not that she was secretly misogynist.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.940]   - So I think we go wrong when people try to understand
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.380]   the world around them and come up with wrong ideas.
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.220]   And it's natural that they would come up with wrong ideas
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.500]   'cause it's hard to figure out what's right.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.460]   So we start with trying to come up
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.620]   with mystical explanations for the existence
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.460]   of the things around us.
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.660]   And that I think very quickly leads to some people
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.220]   being able to communicate with the mystical stuff out there,
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.980]   and some people not being able to communicate,
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.660]   and some people wanting to control other people
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.300]   and using those pseudo explanations as a way to control.
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.740]   So you always have,
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.060]   Rand called it Attila and the witch doctor.
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.940]   You always have a witch doctor, the mystic,
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.820]   the philosopher, the intellectual,
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.980]   the philosopher king is a unity of the...
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.020]   And you have an Attila,
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.340]   you have somebody who wants to control other people,
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.820]   who's willing to use force to control other people.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.100]   And when those two get together, that's when things go bad.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:54.100]   And unfortunately, 95, 98% of human history
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.140]   is when those two are together.
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.060]   And so the not having them together,
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.220]   having the right ideas,
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.820]   and the right ideas are ones that are not exclusive
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.980]   to those guys and where we don't allow Attila
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.420]   to have that kind of physical power over us.
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.460]   That's an exception and that's rare.
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.540]   And that's what needs to be defended.
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.100]   - Stalin's not personally killing people.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.380]   Hitler's not personally killing people.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.940]   Charles Manson's not personally killing people.
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.300]   They need their goons.
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.140]   - They need their goons,
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.380]   but they also, they don't have original ideas.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.220]   Nothing Stalin says is original to him.
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.100]   He needs a Marx, even Lenin.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.500]   They all need a Marx.
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.660]   They all, and Marx needs a particular line of thinkers
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.780]   that come before him that set him up
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.740]   for these kinds of ideas.
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.540]   So Stalin both needs his goons,
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.420]   even though he's somewhat of a goon, particularly Stalin.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.660]   - He was a bank robber, yeah.
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.100]   - And then, so take Lenin.
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.380]   Lenin, I think, is a better example
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.940]   'cause Lenin's more intellectual, if you will.
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.300]   But Lenin needs his goons.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.620]   He needs his Stalins.
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.300]   But Lenin also needs his Marx.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.940]   And we don't want to let Marx off the hook
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.980]   because Marx knows, I think, implicitly,
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.300]   that his ideas have to lead to Lenin and Stalin.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.740]   His ideas are not neutral.
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.280]   - I don't think it's implicit at all.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.500]   I think Marx very much glorified revolution,
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.980]   blood and terror.
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.180]   This is not implicit in the slightest.
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.020]   - No, absolutely.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.580]   I mean, there are letters between him and Engels
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.940]   where they talk about which peoples
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.940]   will have to be eliminated
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.420]   'cause they don't have that proletarian thing, right?
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.420]   So I think certain peoples in Southern Europe
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.460]   are not appropriate for the utopia to come
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.740]   and will have to be gone.
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.540]   - And Marx also had this concept,
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.500]   which we still see today in garbled ways,
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.140]   of polylogism, which is if you're a capitalist
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.620]   and I'm bourgeois or I'm a worker,
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.900]   you just, your logic is different than mine.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.700]   It's literally gonna be impossible for us to communicate.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.740]   And at a certain point, you're gonna have to be liquidated
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.460]   and they pretend that doesn't mean murdered,
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.380]   but it means murdered.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.540]   And very quickly, everyone becomes a capitalist or bourgeois
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.840]   and then you have the holodomor and things like this.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.540]   - No, he knows exactly where it's gonna lead.
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.540]   And this is why people say, "Oh, Marx is not evil.
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.380]   "He just wrote books."
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.700]   No, it's the people who write books
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.140]   who are responsible for the way history evolves.
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.860]   And they know, they know.
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.460]   The bad guys certainly know the consequence of their ideas
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.860]   and they need to bear the moral responsibility
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.500]   for what happens when the ideas are implemented.
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.020]   - Here's the, wait, can I ask a question?
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:22.860]   - Yeah.
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.900]   - 'Cause I think I know more about Rand than Yaron does.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.740]   So let's see.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.580]   - Oh. - Okay.
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.180]   - The gauntlet's been thrown down.
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.860]   Who did Ayn Rand say is the most evil man who ever lived?
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.500]   - Immanuel Kant. - That's right, correct.
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.340]   - No, that I know.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.180]   I mean, it's a big deal that Immanuel Kant is,
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.500]   and most people don't understand why
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.700]   because if you read Kant, there's certain passages in Kant
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.900]   that sound pretty liberal, they sound pretty,
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.940]   he's for the, it sounds like he's for the individual,
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.300]   he sounds like he's for the American Revolution,
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.140]   things like that.
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.040]   But when you actually read his philosophy
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.140]   and what he's trying to defend
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.060]   and what he's trying to undermine,
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.940]   he's trying to undermine the foundations
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.060]   that make the revolution possible,
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.380]   that make freedom and individualism possible.
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.420]   He's trying to destroy the Enlightenment,
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.900]   and the Enlightenment is, are those ideas
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.940]   that make freedom, individualism feasible.
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.620]   He's trying to undermine reason,
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.780]   and without reason, we're nothing,
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.860]   we're not, we can't survive as a species.
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.980]   So, and that's why she thought he was the most evil person,
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.860]   because his ideas undermine the very foundations
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.140]   of what it requires to be a human being,
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.860]   reason and individualism.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.300]   Those are the things he's trying to eviscerate.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.380]   - I know you've talked about Hoffman before.
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:37.380]   So Hoffman is a modern day attempt to--
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.220]   - Who's Hoffman?
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.700]   - Donald Hoffman?
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.540]   - Donald Hoffman.
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.260]   - Donald Hoffman is the University of California,
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.900]   Irvine neurologist, neuroscientist, something like that.
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.600]   So I met him once, and we were at one of these conferences
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.300]   where you do a quick intro, you sit
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.500]   and you do a quick intro, his introduction was,
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.900]   "I've just written a book that proves
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.280]   "that evolution has conditioned us not to see reality."
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.260]   - Okay, that is very Kantian.
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.980]   - Yeah, and he is basically just presenting pseudoscience
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:13.020]   to defend Kant's position about epistemology,
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:18.020]   and about metaphysics, and there's nothing original there.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.020]   And he puts up a bunch of equations,
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:24.060]   and he says, "I ran a simulation, and it proves I'm right."
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.940]   - So, Yaron is a little bit frustrated
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.420]   with Donald Hoffman's work.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.260]   Let me--
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.740]   - I'm not frustrated, I just think it's completely wrong,
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.980]   and it's anti-life, anti-mind, anti-evolution.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.100]   I think he's an anti-evolutionist at the end.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.260]   And I think it, you know, any time you say,
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.800]   look, here's the important point.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.700]   Any time you say reality doesn't exist--
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.740]   - Or that you can't perceive it.
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.060]   - Well, who are you?
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.180]   What do you mean by, what do any of your words mean?
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.060]   What does anything you say even mean
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.260]   if it doesn't refer to something
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.620]   that's actually out there in reality?
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.140]   - Let me try to defend this point of view,
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.820]   because in a certain kind of sense,
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.140]   I hear it as being humble in the face
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.300]   of the uncertainty that's around us.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.500]   Sort of, you know, when you speak with the confidence
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:12.500]   of Ayn Rand and yourself, that reason can be like
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.580]   this weapon that cuts through all the bullshit of the world
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.980]   and makes us have an ethical, moral life,
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.580]   and all those kinds of things,
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.740]   you kind of assume that reason is a superpower
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.140]   that has no limits.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:25.980]   - Wait, hold on.
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.820]   - Hold on a second.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.420]   Okay, but--
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.260]   - I got this one.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:35.620]   - See, this is already leading to murder by words.
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.460]   - Yeah.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.300]   - And we've been only talking for 20 minutes.
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.460]   - If the two of us wouldn't get together,
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.740]   wouldn't get along together on an island.
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.820]   - We just make him our slave.
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.780]   We're all gonna get along.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.140]   He's just gonna do the work.
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.420]   - But I'm afraid I cannot provide any value as a slave,
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.460]   so this is not gonna end well for me.
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.460]   - We can provide value as dinner.
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.020]   - That's the problem I'm trying to get to.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.020]   - That's a solution.
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:00.140]   - Okay, but Donald Hoffman says that there is,
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.700]   he makes an argument that, exactly as you said,
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:09.700]   that what we perceive is very, very far
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.380]   from actual physical reality.
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.580]   In fact, we're not able to perceive
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.260]   physical reality at all.
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.180]   And he also makes the bigger claim
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:24.180]   that evolution prefers beings
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.420]   who are not attached to reality.
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.100]   So evolution created creatures
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.860]   that are basically functioning way outside
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.060]   of what the physical reality is.
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.380]   - I got this, I got this.
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.820]   Okay, 'cause there's a lot to unpack here
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.860]   and I hate all of it.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.900]   Okay, first of all, no, no, I'm serious.
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.740]   First of all, when you were making that comment
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.980]   about how reason is a superpower beyond limit,
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.700]   you're being ironic, but it's true.
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.900]   And I'll give you one example, which is astronomy.
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.620]   If you look at the physical size of the universe,
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.900]   it's literally in one sense incomprehensible.
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.540]   So he's right in the sense that I do not understand
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.300]   and none of us understand what it means
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.380]   for 93 million miles away for the sun to be.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.100]   It's a number on another screen, right?
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.380]   That said, the fact that my mind,
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.940]   and I'm not one of the great thinkers of all time,
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.460]   is capable-- - Close, but--
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.420]   - We're getting there, is capable of appreciating
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.140]   what the sun means, what heliocentrism means.
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.140]   The fact that we can, you're a math person,
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.820]   that you could look at galaxies and reduce it to 10
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.340]   to the 64th power in terms of distance,
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.220]   that shows the unlimited capacity
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.220]   of the human mind and reason, number one.
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:38.220]   Number two is if he says that evolution favors
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.340]   those who are not in touch with reality,
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.300]   and I don't know in what context he's saying that,
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.900]   'cause that sentence could mean a lot of different things,
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.420]   evolution is what guides,
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.300]   reality is what guides evolution.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.660]   Evolution works because you are fitted
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.500]   to the reality of the situation around you.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.780]   It's not that someone is sitting down and says,
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.020]   "Well, I'm gonna add a fin to this animal
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.580]   "and that fin helps it swim," I engineered a check mark,
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.300]   it's that mutations occur,
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.620]   the vast majority of these mutations are against reality,
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.180]   they do not further this animal's life
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.460]   or this plant's life or this fungus's life,
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.780]   but the ones that are in touch with reality,
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:22.160]   such as, okay, it's really cold here,
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.060]   there's no predators here, if I could figure out,
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.540]   and I'm using that term very loosely,
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.240]   a way where I could survive in the cold,
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.460]   I don't have predation, it's really great.
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:35.180]   So the fact that unconsciously and mindlessly
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.880]   this process can force the mutation and evolution
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.540]   of the form precisely means that they're in touch
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.620]   with reality, now if he means the consciousness
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.180]   is not in touch with reality,
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.260]   that's another thing that I really hate.
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.940]   - You're referring to the reality as like
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.060]   the biological reality of evolution,
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.300]   but all of that is based on many other layers
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.420]   of abstraction that ultimately has quantum mechanics
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.140]   underneath it all, and he's saying somewhere
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.780]   along the layers, you start to lose more and more
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.980]   and more attachment to the actual--
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:03.820]   - Hold on, can I have one more second?
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:04.940]   - Sure, sure.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.220]   - I do not, I despise the idea.
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.420]   I say despise, I'm not using this, I'm not joking,
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.180]   and the idea that the reality we don't live in
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.980]   is somehow more real than this.
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.180]   That is a very dangerous idea to say,
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.460]   well quantum works in this way, and I'm sure he's correct,
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.580]   and none of us disagree with that.
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.660]   What we perceive macro works in a different way,
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.260]   well that's the real reality and this is fake.
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.620]   Bullshit, this is the real reality,
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.260]   that is a different type, a sub-subset,
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.420]   but no one's living there.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.260]   - Well and it's a sub-subset--
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.620]   - And humanity is the starting point.
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.960]   - It's a sub-subset that has to integrate
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.700]   with this world.
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.900]   There isn't two worlds, one in the quantum world
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.460]   and one here, they're integrated.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.100]   Now we might not have the scientific knowledge
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.020]   to know how they're integrated, but so what?
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.940]   We know that there's only one reality and that's this one.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.380]   He has this difference, he says evolution
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.940]   matches up to fitness not to reality,
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.860]   and he creates this dichotomy between fitness and reality,
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.620]   but that's complete nonsense.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.820]   There is no such thing as a concept of fitness
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.920]   outside of fitness to what?
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.400]   To reality, that fitness and reality are the same thing,
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.020]   they're not separate things.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:17.600]   So the whole way he sets this up intellectually
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.240]   is wrong, I think to some extent dishonest,
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.920]   and certainly philosophically corrupt, and it's Kantian.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.540]   Again, he's accepted Kant's ideas
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.560]   and everybody pretty much has accepted Kant's ideas
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.800]   for the last 200 years, and they give it a different facade
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.840]   and he's giving it an evolutionary facade,
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.820]   but it's just a facade for the same idea,
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.380]   and that is that somehow because we have eyes,
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.140]   we cannot see because the light waves
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.360]   are going through a medium
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.420]   and that medium necessarily distorted.
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.520]   The medium changes the resolution at which you see, right?
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.700]   Like if I take off my glasses,
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.540]   I'm seeing it a little differently,
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.260]   but the thing is still there,
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.760]   and the thing is still there in the way I see it
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.500]   'cause the handle, I'm grasping the handle
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.740]   and lifting the cup.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.860]   That's not an illusion, that is a real cup.
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.340]   - So do you think some things are more real than others?
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.500]   For example, money.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.140]   There's a bunch of things that seem real.
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.740]   This is not an animal farm reference.
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.740]   - Is this gonna be about love?
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.940]   There's nothing as real as love, right, Lex?
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.780]   (laughing)
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.100]   What is love?
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.180]   - Love is a fundamental part of the quantum mechanics, yes.
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.520]   No. - No.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.780]   - No, no.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.180]   Is there some things that have become reality
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:28.500]   because we humans in a collective sense believe it?
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.300]   - You can't believe something collectively.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.900]   Now, it doesn't become real.
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.700]   What does it mean to say something's real?
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.780]   That is, you can, so love, for example,
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:36.820]   love's a good example, right?
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.560]   Love is an abstraction, right?
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.300]   It's not something I can touch.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.620]   It's not something I can see,
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.940]   but it's certainly something you could feel.
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:43.780]   - Well, it's something you could hit.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.820]   - Right? (laughing)
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.420]   - We love differently.
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.500]   You and I. - I don't think that's true.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.340]   I think I'm just so honest about it.
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.540]   - You can't hit love.
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.180]   You can't, love is an abstraction.
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.140]   So is love real?
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.380]   Yes, it's real 'cause I feel it.
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.260]   It's an existent, but it's not an existent
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.320]   in the same sense as this cup is.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:05.220]   So, you know, abstractions are real,
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.100]   but at the end of the day,
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.580]   all abstractions have to be able to be,
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.980]   you know, reduced to actual concrete
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.740]   so that you can either see it.
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.060]   - I really don't like criticizing someone whose work
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.220]   I haven't read secondhand.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.900]   So I wanna take this away from speaking about him personally
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.580]   'cause I'm not familiar with his work, but I--
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.940]   - He's a nice guy.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.060]   - That makes me like him. - Yeah, no, I met him.
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.180]   - That makes him like him less.
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.020]   I think--
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.280]   - I'm gonna take you back talking about fitness,
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.220]   evolutionary fitness.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:36.220]   - I think there's disingenuousness
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.360]   when we talk about the word real
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.840]   in terms of ideas are real versus the cup is real.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.320]   And you try to switch back between those two meanings,
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.480]   and it's a little bit of linguistic wordplay
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.240]   that is trying to force a point that's not accurate,
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.100]   in my opinion.
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.200]   - Well, I think the issue is,
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.560]   and what he's challenging is,
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.840]   and what Kant is challenging is,
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.200]   do we know reality?
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.280]   And I think the answer is, yes, we do.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.240]   We know reality, we observe it.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.760]   Now, do we know everything about reality?
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.520]   No, we can't, for example,
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.840]   sense what a bat senses as reality, right?
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.960]   A bat observes reality through, what is it?
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.800]   - Sonar.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.800]   - Sound waves, right, through sonar, right?
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.200]   So it has a different sense, but it's the same reality.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.000]   It's still a table.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.560]   The bat's spatial relationship to the table
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.840]   is different than ours,
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.520]   but the object is still the same object.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.160]   - But how do you know that's true?
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.960]   Are you not just hoping that's true?
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.040]   Or assuming that's true?
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.840]   - No, that's what no means.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.600]   No means I have identified an aspect of reality.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.840]   That's literally the definition of knowledge.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.960]   Now, if you say, how are you certain?
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.560]   Well, that's a whole other question,
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.680]   but one of the reasons I know it was certain
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.000]   is 'cause this happens.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.560]   And I know this is gonna happen,
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.440]   and if I tell you, if you go downstairs,
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.420]   you're gonna see Mr. Jones,
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.920]   and you walk downstairs, and I see Mr. Jones,
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.440]   at the very least, something's going on there.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.520]   - So what about all the things
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.680]   that mess with our perception?
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.200]   For example, we've talked about psychedelics before,
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.960]   talked about in dreams where you're detached from this.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.680]   I mean, there's certain things that happen to your brain
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.200]   to where you're not able to perceive.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.880]   - So you're not perceiving reality, that's right.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.720]   So your brain is creating a different reality.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.760]   It's not real.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.160]   - How do you know it's not real?
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.760]   How do you know the elves will meet in an alligator tail?
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.600]   - Because partially because I need to take a drug
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:28.420]   in order to do it, because I'm asleep when I'm dreaming.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.740]   It's not reality.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:33.540]   That is clearly a creation of a mind.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:34.380]   It's not a creation.
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.020]   - Hold on, let's get to the psychedelics.
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:36.860]   - The drug is real.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.700]   - If you are, I think you're gonna be thinking,
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.340]   I'm joking a lot more than I am this episode.
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.700]   I'm gonna be the humanist objectivist.
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.500]   He could be the court jester.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.100]   In terms of psychedelic,
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.980]   when people are perceiving these elves,
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.420]   these machine elves, these other entities,
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.160]   whether they could either be real or not, I don't know.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.180]   But the point is that doesn't go to his broader point,
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.680]   because if these beings exist,
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.440]   and the only way to perceive them is to take a drug,
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.680]   they still exist.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.300]   This is just, for example,
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:13.300]   if I'm walking outside in the woods at night,
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.360]   and there's a deer, and I can't see it,
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.640]   but if I put on night vision goggles, I can see it,
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.480]   that deer was there the entire time.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.240]   It's not that the night vision goggles
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.760]   caused the deer to appear.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.680]   You can recreate it not only using night vision goggles,
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.160]   but you can then use sonar,
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.480]   you can use other mechanisms
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.880]   by which to prove that the deer is there.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.680]   The thing with psychedelics is that,
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.720]   now I don't know,
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.720]   because maybe I'm the least experienced
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.660]   with psychedelics here probably.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.240]   My guess is every time you take the psychedelic,
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.000]   you have exactly the same experience of the deer?
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.320]   No.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.200]   Second, are there other mechanisms,
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.400]   other scientific mechanisms
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.640]   by which I can find the deer out there,
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.920]   other than the psychedelics?
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.760]   - We don't know yet.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.000]   - No, well, we don't know yet.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.280]   - Well, but this is Occam's razor, right?
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.320]   The simplest explanation here is the most likely,
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.400]   and that is that you've taken something
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.120]   that's messing with the chemicals in the brain,
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:08.000]   something is being, your brain can project, we dream.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.860]   Nobody's arguing that the dream is real,
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.920]   and reality is not, or if they are, I think they're nuts.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.000]   The dream is a dream.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Your brain is creating an image of telling you a story.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.080]   Psychedelics are simulating the same thing.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.480]   That's probably what's going on
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.320]   until there's evidence to the contrary.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.160]   - Well, hold on.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.120]   I'm gonna disagree with you a little bit,
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.320]   because let's take Adderall, for example.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.000]   No one here disagrees that that's something
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.400]   much more simpler and less out of this world.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.080]   I think what he might be speaking to,
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.320]   I know Joe Rogan talks about this
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.840]   and other people in this space,
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.280]   is that when you take certain drugs,
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.360]   it changes your perception.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.480]   It doesn't have to be otherworldly.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.000]   It can change your perception of what's around you.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.760]   And as an example, what they talk about is,
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.080]   the three of us are talking,
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.680]   there's lots of other stuff in the room.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.000]   We're only aware of it vaguely on a personal level.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.600]   - So it changes the-- - Hold on, let me finish.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.760]   - No, I don't do that.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.200]   I'm Israeli. - You're about to start.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.960]   - Back to the desert island murder.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.040]   - We just resolved it within three seconds.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.080]   There's no conk.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.520]   - He's trying to get us--
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.120]   - Yeah, it's not gonna happen.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.080]   - Exactly, I'm trying to create murder.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.160]   - No one has asthma.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.200]   It's gonna be fine.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.720]   - 'Cause if the two of you murder each other,
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   there's more food for me.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.560]   I'm just saying.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.280]   - You eat robotsy alcohol.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.120]   - Ratings would go up.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.200]   Viewership would go up.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.600]   - Yeah, it's good for the ratings, yeah.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.200]   - But if you take, for example, Adderall or Speed, right?
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.000]   People, like you focus on things,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.560]   you perceive things that aren't there,
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.840]   but that doesn't mean those things
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.720]   weren't there to begin with.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.000]   There are absolutely ways to change human perception,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.480]   chemically, through glasses, through getting drunk.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.040]   None of that changes the fact that the reality underneath it
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.560]   is real and is causing this effect.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.360]   - Absolutely, and it has a particular nature, right?
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.080]   And all it's doing is changing the focus, right?
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.400]   So if I take off my glasses, I'm seeing the same thing.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.960]   I'm just seeing something's out of focus.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.160]   And maybe in the distance, I can't see something.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.200]   It's just gone.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.080]   And then I put it on, there it is.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.280]   That thing was always there.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.480]   It's just the sensitivity I have to it has changed.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.520]   And it's absolutely not sensitive to everything equally.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.760]   And drugs can change the relative sensitivities.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.000]   It doesn't change reality.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.640]   It changes our ability to focus on reality.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.320]   - Let me give you one simple example.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.480]   The microscope.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.320]   I forget who it was.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.400]   His name was with an L.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.840]   The scientist who discovered it,
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.520]   he had a drop of water and he's seeing monsters,
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.360]   the protozoa in this drop of water.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.720]   For him, it must've been, it is like a drug experience.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.280]   Like, wait a minute, I'm drinking this.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.640]   And there's alien beings whose shapes are completely crazy
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.480]   in this water.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.440]   Those beings were always there.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.080]   Those beings were there before any of us were here.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.760]   They've been there for billions of years.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.880]   But because he had this apparatus,
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.760]   now he's able to see protozoa.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.920]   No one's arguing protozoa are extra dimensional.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.600]   No one's arguing they're supernatural.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.320]   Amoebas are well-studied, paramecia, all the other lots.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.800]   So if these elves, the machine elves are real,
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.320]   and the only way to perceive them is through DMT
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.360]   or something like that,
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.120]   that doesn't contradict the broader point
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.400]   that they've always been there.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.320]   And this is the mechanism for perceiving them.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.160]   - So here's the word I was looking for.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.840]   It's a word actually Greg taught me this.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.840]   So Greg, so let me, so it's resolution, right?
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.880]   So it's resolution.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.600]   My resolution changes with the glasses.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.560]   My resolution gets finer with the microscope.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.880]   So there's probably some bacteria here on the table.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.720]   - 100%.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.840]   - There's no doubt about it.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.120]   I can't see them.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.880]   So I need a microscope to see them,
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.680]   but they're either there or they're not there.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.200]   And I have the tools to discover
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.000]   whether they are there or they're not there.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.960]   And that's called a microscope.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.040]   Now they could be even smaller beings
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.360]   that even with a microscope, I won't be able to define,
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.320]   but that's completely arbitrary to claim that,
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.680]   that they're there until I find a tool
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.000]   to be able to discover it.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.600]   The same with what you see if you're seeing other beings
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.000]   when you're taking psychedelics.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.480]   Unless you find another tool to be able to see them with,
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.800]   the simplest assumption is probably the truest assumption.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.280]   - But even the not simplest assumption
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.400]   doesn't contradict the broader point.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.240]   - No.
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.080]   - Which is again, if that's what it is.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:52.920]   - Reality is what it is.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.440]   If it turns out that there are these creatures
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.640]   that you can only see with psychedelics,
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.320]   then there are these creatures
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.680]   that you can only see with psychedelics.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.880]   And our resolution while we're not on psychedelics
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.440]   is not fine enough to observe them.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.280]   - So what?
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.600]   - That doesn't change the fact that we evolved
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.880]   to survive in reality as it is.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.360]   - What do you do with the possibility that our resolution
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.880]   as it currently stands is really, really crappy?
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.320]   That basically--
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.240]   - Well, it's not.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.680]   - No, but you don't know that.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.040]   - No, we know it completely.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.000]   - Compared to who?
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.800]   - Compared to the future possibilities
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.640]   like artificial intelligence.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.480]   - It is true.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.000]   - Or us, hundreds of years in the future.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.640]   - Fine, but that's not relevant.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.440]   - Much, much, like orders of magnitude.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.520]   - No, but here I'll use the standard
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.060]   that Hoffman uses, evolution, right?
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.060]   The reason I know that our resolution is phenomenal,
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.800]   is phenomenally good, right?
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.000]   Is look at us.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.080]   We're sitting here comfortably in an apartment
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:49.160]   with air conditioning and in warm Austin with microphones
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.000]   and it can't, where did all this stuff?
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.120]   We're really good at survival and changing environment.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.960]   Indeed, if you look at the species that we know of,
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.760]   there's not a species that come anywhere close
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.320]   to our ability to deal with reality,
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.440]   to observe to reality, to understand reality
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.280]   and to shape it.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.480]   Now in the future, well, we'll come up with machines
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.720]   that can figure out stuff that we have no clue about today.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:12.560]   - Yeah, but so--
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.120]   - That's only because we're so well suited to reality
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:15.960]   that can we create those machines.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.080]   - And I promise you, in the future,
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.360]   it's gonna be much more what you're saying.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.200]   That's how it's gonna happen.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.400]   - No, but the thing is, when the creatures from the future
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.920]   look back to the things we're saying now,
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.680]   what I ran and saying, what you're saying with certainty,
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.340]   do you think they'll laugh at the level
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.520]   of how much confusion there was, how much inaccuracy?
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.360]   - Did you, no.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.860]   - No, no, no, let me get this one.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.120]   You know what they're gonna do?
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.800]   They're gonna do what you do when any of us read Aristotle
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.240]   or read any of these great geniuses of the past.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.720]   It's like, these people didn't have electricity.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.000]   They didn't have warm clothes or anything,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.600]   and they're able to figure out the diameter of the earth.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.600]   Like the creativity to be,
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.960]   and to get it within a few miles, the creativity,
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.360]   and to figure out the speed of light
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.320]   when you don't even have a stopwatch.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.400]   When you look back, a lot of it's nonsense,
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.720]   and we, but at the same,
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.880]   it's like when you're talking to a kid.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.640]   You disregard the nonsense,
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.160]   and when they get something right, it's all, that's you.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.200]   So it's never a numbers game, right?
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:16.200]   So it's the few that validate and justify the rest.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.680]   So when you look at Aristotle, he's talking about the,
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.720]   there was one of those causes, which is like time travel,
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.080]   and it doesn't really make sense,
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.280]   but you look at the rest of his stuff,
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.040]   or even Plato or any of these greats,
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.960]   it's like, oh my, this is an amazing miracle.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.320]   And not, I wouldn't say literally miracle,
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.240]   I got you, Ramon.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.360]   But at the same time, yeah,
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.200]   a lot of these other people had stupid ideas.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.040]   You don't care.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.460]   You care about those great, great minds,
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.800]   and how they moved us all forward.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.040]   To this day, we still study Pythagoras.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.560]   - Of course, and it's not even,
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.240]   it's not even just the sciences and the math.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.920]   Think about the philosophy.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.440]   I mean, how much is there to learn from reading Aristotle,
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.920]   or Plato, Socrates, when you disagree with them?
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.880]   I mean, how many giants have there been
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.200]   in all of human history that have had the minds
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.800]   of a Socrates, a Plato, and an Aristotle?
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.840]   A thousand years, will they look back at Plato
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.520]   and Aristotle and admire them?
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.520]   Absolutely.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.360]   Will they find certain things that are wrong?
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.080]   Yes, but certain things that Aristotle discovered
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.040]   are absolutely right and will always be right.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.520]   Certain things that Einstein discovered
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.760]   will always be right.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.800]   I think a lot of what he came up with,
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.280]   will some things be discovered to be wrong?
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.580]   But you know, that wouldn't shock me.
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:29.580]   But the genius and the truth
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:33.080]   of the we know today is amazing.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:33.920]   It's stunning.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.880]   To be pessimistic about us,
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.500]   because in the future we'll know more.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.480]   Not pessimistic, but more humble.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.120]   There's no reason to be humble.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.600]   I mean, I really think humility is a vice, not a virtue.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.040]   What's there to be humble about?
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.440]   Look at life.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.880]   This is amazing.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.120]   We should be--
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.160]   But the word humble has different meanings.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.080]   No, I know, I know.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:53.920]   Okay, okay.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.760]   I was going to get it.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:55.580]   Yeah, yeah, okay, I'm sorry.
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:56.420]   I was going to get it.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.680]   I mean, humility in the sense of,
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:03.680]   you know, humility in the sense of not appreciating
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.960]   the genius and the ability and the success
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.920]   and all the stuff that we as individuals,
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.100]   I think, in our lives,
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.080]   but as a culture, as a movement,
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.840]   if you think about movement in terms of those of us
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.040]   who respect reason have achieved in spite of the odds,
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.000]   we should be proud of that and pride is the virtue.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.880]   Humility in the sense of,
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.800]   yeah, I know there's more to know.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.320]   I know there's a lot more to know
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.800]   and in the future we'll know more, sure.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.040]   But I don't think that's the way.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.760]   See, I take humility as the way the Christians use it,
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.320]   which is the other way and I think it's a real vice.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.560]   It's don't think of yourself too much
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.000]   just 'cause you can think, you know,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.240]   that's no big deal or just 'cause you can create this.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.440]   It is a big deal.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.100]   Your achievements are a big deal
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.880]   and you should take credit for them.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.360]   So be careful with the word humility
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.300]   because the real meaning is the Christian meaning,
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.960]   which is a very, very bad meaning.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.800]   Well, hold on.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.760]   Let me be a little pedantic
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.160]   'cause there's no such thing as real meaning, right?
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.320]   So there's different meanings, okay?
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.160]   Hold on.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.000]   I'm not gonna get into semantics
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.160]   but here's another real meaning
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.160]   that you're not gonna disagree with,
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.380]   which is the smartest person on earth
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.340]   is ignorant of 99.9% of knowledge, right?
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:12.720]   So if I meet someone who is less intelligent than me
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.320]   and less informed than me,
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.360]   it is still certain that this person has things to teach me.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:22.760]   If I go to a mechanic and maybe this guy's dumb as rocks,
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.240]   I don't know anything about cars.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.760]   What he tells me about that car
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.120]   is I could take it to the bank.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.380]   He's gonna be in a position to inform me.
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.640]   So one of the reasons humility is extremely important
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.560]   is very often you have people,
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.800]   and you see this very much in academia,
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.280]   who think, you know exactly where I'm going, Yaron,
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.960]   who think they're know-it-alls
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.960]   and they think, "Oh, I have this degree.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:43.800]   "You're a layman.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.760]   "You've never been formally educated.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.880]   "Therefore, not only are you dumb and uneducated,
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.720]   "and you're wrong."
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.240]   And it's like, this person might be have,
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.400]   one great example of this,
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.560]   and this is an example Yaron might not like,
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.520]   is a lot of times you have these native populations
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.140]   and they'll have a better understanding
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.420]   of the animals around them,
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.060]   the plants, the fruits, whatever,
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.720]   and you'd have these scientists and be like,
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.580]   "Oh, they're talking about this monster in the woods.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.060]   "Yeah, whatever, this giant ape."
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.620]   But it was real, it was the gorilla.
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.100]   But you dismiss them 'cause,
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.140]   "Oh, these are stupid, ignorant, whatever people."
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.520]   That's kind of changed to some extent,
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.160]   but that is an aspect of humility
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.980]   that I think behooves especially highly intelligent people
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.860]   because there is such a presumption to be dismissive
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.820]   of people who you regard as less than,
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.100]   but they're often right.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:31.500]   - So I agree with all of the concrete examples.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.700]   I just think we should come up
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.900]   with a better word than humility.
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.700]   And I don't have one 'cause I'm not a woodsmith.
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.580]   This is not my strength.
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:43.580]   But humility is a word from the Christian ethics,
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:46.020]   and it means something very specific
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.380]   in the field of ethics.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:52.180]   And it means the opposite of what I think virtue requires.
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:56.260]   It's demeaning, it's to put you down,
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:00.140]   it's to resist pride.
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.820]   And I think pride is a very important thing.
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:02.980]   - I don't know, Yaron.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.740]   - But again, you have to define your terms properly.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:08.460]   - Hating myself has been quite useful for me as a-
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.060]   - Well, but that's 'cause you're Russian and Jewish.
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.700]   So by- - What?
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.940]   This changes everything.
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:15.700]   (all laughing)
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.900]   - This is what happens, right?
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.740]   We're brought up to feel exactly that way.
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.620]   - Lex has been a good Russian boy.
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:23.900]   So we got him. - Oh my God.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.940]   - What is this? - What is this?
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.020]   - Gematogen, what is this?
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.140]   - Gematogen? - Is that what it says?
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.460]   - Yeah, it's gematogen.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.780]   I can't, I'm blind.
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.660]   - Yeah, but- - As long as you're good
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.580]   Russian mind chick, we have candy for you.
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:37.660]   - But is it kosher?
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.540]   (Lex laughing)
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.040]   Did you check if it's kosher?
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.700]   - This is Ukrainian, my friend.
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.300]   - Oh! - Oh my God.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.580]   That is a sin. - How dare you?
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.220]   - That is really sinful.
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.900]   - You know, me and Sonai were born in the same town.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:51.740]   - I'm kidding.
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.540]   My dad's Ukrainian, don't get mad.
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:58.540]   - So I don't think self,
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.820]   what did you, how do you define it?
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:01.660]   - Self hate?
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:06.380]   - Yeah, I think self hate is quite destructive.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.220]   - Speak for yourself, Yaron.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.980]   - I think that humility is quite destructive.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:13.100]   Humility in the sense of, I'm no big deal.
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.180]   No, I mean, if you've achieved something in life,
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.020]   you are a big deal.
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.020]   You are a big deal because, you know,
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.380]   look, you got the two of us to fly into town
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.340]   just to sit down here and have a conversation with you.
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.180]   You're a big deal.
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.860]   - He says more about you than me.
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.900]   (laughing)
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.540]   - We're just, we're just lonely.
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.340]   We're lonely, depraved.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.540]   - I'm not lonely, but I might be desperate.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.380]   (laughing)
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.860]   - I'm starting to question your ability to reason
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.500]   with the decisions you're making.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.180]   On the aspect of, and I should mention
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:45.060]   that "The Idiot" by Dostoevsky is one of my favorite novels,
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.980]   and there is a Christian ethic that runs through that.
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.340]   - I mean, because, yeah, I mean, particularly,
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.420]   but I hate to bring this up,
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.740]   but particularly Russians and particularly Russian Jews
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.900]   and particularly Eastern European Jews
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.420]   are incredibly Christian.
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:02.540]   There is a real Christian theme in Judaism
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:06.260]   that's about guilt.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.380]   Guilt is not, there's no guilt in Judaism.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:11.140]   King David doesn't feel any guilt.
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:11.980]   Solomon doesn't.
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.700]   There's no guilt in the Old Testament.
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:17.300]   Plenty of guilt once Christianity has an impact on Judaism.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.660]   We're raised to feel this way.
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.060]   We're raised to be humble.
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.900]   We're raised not to feel special.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.100]   We're raised to think we're no big deal
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:29.100]   and our mothers put us down and use that against us
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.020]   and try to inflict guilt on us.
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.940]   They raise us up and then they knock us down.
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:36.460]   It's a mechanism, but it's a cultural mechanism,
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.980]   and I think it's very destructive
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.580]   to self-esteem and to happiness.
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.460]   - And I'll give you a great,
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.100]   he's absolutely right with what he just said.
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.060]   - I disagree.
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.380]   - Well, yeah, why is he right?
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.220]   - Because my family, for example,
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.140]   still doesn't really understand how I could pay the rent
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.380]   'cause I'd have gone to an office.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.860]   And when I started out trying to be a writer,
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.020]   the immediate reaction isn't,
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.020]   which a lot of times I talk to kids, right,
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.820]   and they have these aspirations,
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.900]   and I'll tell them, "Go for it while you're young.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.860]   "If you fail, you'll go to your grave."
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:05.940]   I tried my best.
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.180]   I didn't make it happen.
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.540]   Whereas if you don't try and never achieve,
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.420]   you are gonna feel horrible for the rest of your life.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.460]   And this is the example I use all the time.
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:14.420]   I bring up many times.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.260]   I go, "Go to any bookstore
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.340]   "and look at all those terrible, terrible books
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.060]   "on the shelves that you wonder, 'How's this a book?'"
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.180]   That could be you.
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.740]   You could be that crappy writer.
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.100]   But the thing is, in that culture
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:26.620]   that Yaron was talking about,
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:28.300]   you tell your family, "I'm gonna be a writer."
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.460]   Who do you think you are?
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.780]   Why do you think you're gonna be?
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:31.740]   You're no Stephen King.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.580]   And it's like, why do you have to be Stephen King?
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.420]   Why can't you just be a mediocre,
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.300]   crappy writer making the rent?
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.500]   - The best that you can be.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.380]   - But even that is an amazing accomplishment.
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.780]   If I don't have to go to an office
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.860]   and I write books that not that many people read,
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.060]   this is the story of my life,
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.940]   at the same time, I do have pride
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.900]   'cause I made this happen.
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.380]   You can be the best version.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:51.340]   I mean, this is a cliche,
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.180]   but you can be the best version of yourself.
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.620]   It's not a competition.
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.940]   And yet, our Jewish mothers,
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.260]   that's not what they aspire us to be.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.580]   They aspire us to be the best version
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:03.260]   of what they imagine, what the culture imagines,
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.900]   what society imagine.
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:09.420]   It's not about you in their minds.
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.220]   And I've seen it.
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.540]   I see it all around me.
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.580]   People putting their kids down, putting themselves down.
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.500]   It's not healthy.
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.860]   - I've never told this story.
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:18.980]   I'm gonna tell it now.
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.020]   When I graduated college,
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.140]   I was a temp for a while
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.220]   'cause I didn't know what I wanted to do.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.060]   And when you're a temp, it's like playing roulette.
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.780]   You're gonna have jobs that pay well, that suck,
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.300]   and pay well, that are great,
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.380]   or that are great, that don't pay well,
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.860]   and suck, and pay poorly.
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.500]   But when you're 21, you have that kind of space.
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:42.180]   And my grandmother was talking to her brother.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.100]   He's talking about his kids.
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:43.940]   She's talking about me.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.660]   She's from Odessa.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.420]   And she told me she lied to him
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.700]   about how much money I was making.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.300]   And that's something I've never brought up,
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.740]   and it still hurts me
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:57.740]   because it's like your approval of me
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:01.620]   should be a function of my character, my happiness.
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:05.020]   And the fact that you feel ashamed
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.580]   over how much money I'm making,
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.260]   especially at this point in my life,
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:11.820]   I thought was very, really misplaced priorities.
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.020]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:13.860]   - I don't know.
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.300]   I don't know what to make of that.
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.060]   - I think there's a huge benefit
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:21.180]   to the humility, terms aside,
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.100]   for believing that others can teach you a lot.
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.540]   Everybody can teach you a lot.
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:26.380]   - I think we all agree on this.
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.220]   - I just mentioned that, the mechanic.
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:28.040]   - No, you do it. - We all agree on that.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.300]   - Exactly, exactly, that's the point.
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:33.220]   But for that, I do believe you have to not
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:36.900]   constantly sort of break your ego apart
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:40.620]   and constantly question whether
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:42.340]   you know anything about this world.
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:44.620]   And sort of there's a negativity with it
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.740]   that I think is very useful
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.780]   and it's also very fulfilling, just constantly,
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.840]   I don't know.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:52.680]   - It's the other way around.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:57.380]   I find that the more I know, the more I know I know,
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.900]   the easier it is for me to learn from other people.
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:02.380]   The broader a context I have,
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:06.860]   the more curious I become, the more areas I know.
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.220]   It's true that the more you know,
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.100]   the more areas you know you don't know.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.220]   And the more I find myself attracted to people
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.540]   who can teach me something about things I don't know.
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:16.920]   Whereas if I was ignorant,
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.080]   if I truly believed I didn't know anything,
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.340]   I don't know how I would live.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:27.220]   It would really completely challenge everything,
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.620]   everything about life for me.
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:29.740]   Where would I even start?
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:30.940]   You wouldn't know where to start.
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:34.920]   So no, I think, and if you don't recognize what you know,
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.660]   you don't have a full appreciation of yourself.
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:41.660]   So really building a recognition of what do I know, right?
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:42.740]   And how much do I know?
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.580]   Is really crucial to living.
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:46.820]   - And I'll tell you something else
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.020]   that furthers my life enormously,
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.580]   is when you reach a certain point in your career
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.020]   and your life, and you're talking to people
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.300]   who are a lot younger,
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.900]   and they might be smart, driven, intelligent,
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.100]   they lack data.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.100]   When you're 23, you don't know how to speak corporate,
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.520]   you don't know what the code words are.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.380]   So if I am in a position to sit down with this kid
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.140]   and be like, do X, Y, and Z,
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.940]   and here's why I'm coming to this conclusion.
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:09.660]   This is the information that released me this conclusion.
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.260]   And I can save them from some of the suffering
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:13.380]   I went through.
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.500]   That is very gratifying.
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.380]   It's making the world a better place.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.700]   And it's also the opposite in a sense of humility,
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.220]   'cause like in this context--
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:22.140]   - I'm an expert.
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.580]   - Or I'm at least knowledgeable enough
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.220]   that I'm comfortable giving you advice.
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:28.000]   - Yeah, and look, everything I do is about me knowing stuff
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.820]   that other people don't.
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.640]   And I know a lot of stuff other people don't, and I do.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.500]   And it's fun.
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.640]   I'm a teacher, I'm a teacher at heart, always happy.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.460]   It turns out I didn't know that early on.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:41.500]   But I like becoming an expert
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.180]   and then trying to teach people.
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.940]   It doesn't mean I know everything.
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:45.980]   Quite the contrary.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.780]   Again, the more I know, the more I know
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.180]   that there's certain things I don't know
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.340]   and there's certain areas of expertise I don't have.
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:53.860]   But look, pride is a broader concept than that.
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:57.420]   Pride is about, and humility is the opposite of pride,
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:58.900]   and Christianity has that right.
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.060]   Pride is about taking your life seriously.
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:05.220]   Pride is about wanting to be really good at living,
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.740]   wanting to have the knowledge.
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:10.100]   And I think what you're describing is,
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.460]   you're describing is I'm constantly learning.
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:15.020]   Sometimes I have to re-challenge myself.
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:16.420]   I have to question what I believed
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.940]   in order to gain new knowledge.
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:20.980]   That's all good, but that is a drive
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:23.020]   that is driven by pride.
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.140]   You want to know.
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:27.580]   There are lots of people out there that don't want to know
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.480]   because they don't have that pride.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.860]   They don't have that commitment to live,
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.140]   the commitment to achieving something.
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:34.980]   - And I'm going to say something else
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.220]   that I think is crucial.
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:40.260]   Humility is extremely important when it comes to politics,
[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.280]   because if you feel comfortable telling someone
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.040]   you've never met how to live their life,
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.260]   that is a complete lack of humility.
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.700]   - Well, I lack it, obviously,
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.140]   'cause I tell people how to live all the time.
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.300]   - Not through force.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.620]   - Not through force. - That's what I'm saying.
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.220]   - And of course, not in the concrete.
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.940]   I don't tell them, move to,
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.260]   although I do tell people to move to Austin,
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.740]   but I don't tell them,
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.740]   this is what you do as a profession,
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:02.940]   but I give them the principles,
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:03.780]   'cause I think their principles are how to live.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:04.820]   - They're making the choice.
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:05.660]   That's my point.
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:07.220]   Politically, what I'm saying is,
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.380]   it shows a lack of humility to be like,
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.860]   I've never met this person.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.140]   This is how I'm going to take money from him.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:13.980]   I'm going to--
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.220]   - See, but I don't see that humility.
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.060]   There's nothing--
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:16.880]   - No, it's the lack of humility.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.620]   - No, but it's not even a lack of humility,
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:19.660]   because it's--
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.060]   - Who am I to tell him how to live?
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.600]   - No, of course you're not. - It's lack of humility.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.820]   - No, who are you to tell him how to live
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:28.720]   is an issue of, it's an issue of force and rights
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.780]   and a bunch of different things.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.940]   I don't think it's a lack of humility there.
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.140]   I think it's a lack of being a human being.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:37.340]   It can be both.
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:38.180]   - Sure.
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:42.180]   Who gives you the right to dictate to somebody else
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.180]   how to live their lives?
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:44.420]   - Yeah, but that's a lack of humility
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:46.900]   if you think you have that right.
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.940]   - Again, we're using humility in a very different way.
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:49.780]   - No, we're using the same way.
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.600]   - I don't think it's a good--
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.700]   - Because the person who feels comfortable,
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.980]   they think, I know better than you
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.440]   how you should live your life
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.620]   to the point where I'm capable of forcing you
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:01.020]   because I know it's going to be best for you
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:01.860]   in the long run.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:02.820]   - And the answer is, you don't know.
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.700]   - Right, but that's a lack of humility.
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:07.020]   - I think in your mind, you're on humility
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.420]   somehow tied to the Christian concept of humility
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:11.060]   and so you're kind of allergic to the word--
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:12.660]   - Well, absolutely, because it's part of,
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.660]   if you look at the cardinal virtues,
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:18.460]   the cardinal sins in Christianity,
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.260]   pride is a cardinal sin
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:22.900]   and humility is a cardinal virtue,
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.380]   but they don't mean it in this sense
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.700]   because they're happy to tell you how to live, right?
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.920]   They're happy to be philosopher kings over your life
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.660]   and they believe that's being humble
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.660]   and you should be humble, by the way,
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.660]   in listening to the Pope or listening to God
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:36.640]   because what do you know?
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.700]   You know nothing.
[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.780]   God knows everything, so you should shut up
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.180]   and do what you're told.
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.980]   That's the sense in which I don't think you should be humble.
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.020]   I mean, it's a sense in which I always use
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:47.940]   the example of Abraham, right?
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.060]   God comes to Abraham and says,
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:52.980]   go kill your eldest son, your only son, right?
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.540]   Your only son, go kill him.
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.500]   It's like, and what does Abraham do?
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.980]   He says, yes, sir, I'll follow,
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:00.540]   and he's a moral hero.
[00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.540]   For Judaism, Christianity, and Islam,
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:04.580]   he's a moral hero 'cause he follows orders
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.220]   'cause he's humble.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.780]   I would tell God to go to hell.
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.740]   Screw you, I'm not killing my son.
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.660]   There's no way.
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.780]   - I mean, he killed his son, so it's only fair.
[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:15.620]   - Well, this is before he killed his son,
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:17.500]   so I didn't know that, right?
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.820]   But no, but part of the evil of Christianity
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:21.820]   is that he's killed his son
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:25.580]   in the most torturous form of death possible.
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:26.980]   I mean, the whole story of Jesus
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.340]   is one of the most immoral, unjust stories ever told
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.180]   and that Christians elevate this to a position of,
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:35.140]   I'd love to have this conversation with Jordan, right?
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:36.420]   Jordan Peterson.
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.260]   The idea of elevating--
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.460]   - That'll never happen.
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:39.300]   - No, it won't.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:40.940]   But elevating Jesus, exactly,
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.140]   elevating Jesus to a superhero status
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:45.740]   for one of the most immoral acts in human history
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:47.260]   is horrific.
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:50.180]   So yeah, I mean, I'm opposed to God
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:52.140]   sacrificing his own son, nevermind my son.
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:53.620]   But yeah, let him go do it to his own son.
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.300]   - But he didn't kill Isaac, he killed the goat.
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.460]   - The story's about Abraham, not about God.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:01.020]   First of all, God is mean, right, to put Abraham through that
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:05.380]   but Abraham has to assume that he's going to kill his son
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.900]   and he lifts his, he's going to do it and he stopped.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.700]   So the whole point is obedience.
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.620]   That's where humility leads to.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.900]   It leads to the opposite of the story you were telling.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:15.820]   It leads to people saying,
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.420]   "Yes, I should be told what to do.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.260]   "Where's the authority who actually knows something?"
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.060]   'Cause I don't know anything.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:23.740]   No, I know a lot and I know a lot about my life.
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:24.580]   - The science--
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:25.980]   - So you stay away from my life
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:27.260]   'cause I have pride in my life.
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:28.820]   The science is settled, right?
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:29.740]   Look at these experts.
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.140]   Who am I to argue with these experts?
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.420]   They tell me to drink dog pee, I'm gonna drink,
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:34.820]   what am I, not drink dog pee?
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:35.660]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:36.500]   - Let's go back to the island.
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.100]   - Speaking of which.
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.740]   - We're on island again?
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.180]   - We're back to the island.
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:44.740]   And let's go to the island, let's--
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.660]   - I live on an island.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:50.500]   - Everything's an island in some context.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.860]   Like Earth is an island, this universe is an island
[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:53.940]   in a multiverse.
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:57.180]   - There are no multiverses, there's only one universe.
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:01.500]   - All right, so let's invite Jordan Peterson to this island.
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.260]   - You wish, hold on.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.100]   - Submit.
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:05.220]   - Hold on a sec.
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.020]   Hey girl, what you doing?
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:11.860]   Lex, Lex Friedman, look him up.
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:12.700]   - Lex who?
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:13.540]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.360]   - I don't know. - Lex who?
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.060]   - Lex has as big of a following almost as Jordan does.
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:20.100]   - I know Jordan, I know his family actually
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.580]   through Jim Keller, who's his relative, he's an engineer.
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:25.940]   So, and I just talked to Sam.
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:31.940]   Who is perhaps a little bit aligned in some sense
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:34.460]   on your perspective on religion and so on.
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:35.660]   So let me ask, is there some--
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:36.980]   - Religion, yes, but--
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:37.820]   - Other things, no.
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:38.660]   - Sam Harris.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:39.500]   - Sam Harris, yeah.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.140]   Oh, sorry, Sam Harris.
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.700]   - He's on first name relationship with these guys.
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:44.020]   - Look at this inside baseball.
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.260]   I just talked to Sam.
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:46.340]   (laughing)
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:47.180]   - I thought--
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.460]   - Let's talk about humility, let's talk about humility.
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:52.300]   My buddy Sam, I was talking to Barack, you might know him.
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:54.300]   - I simply--
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:56.380]   - Humility went out the window.
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:00.340]   - I'm just a natural language processing model
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.180]   that I assume that once I mentioned Jordan Peterson,
[00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:06.100]   it becomes an obvious statement what Sam means.
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:07.660]   This is how neural networks think.
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:10.460]   This is how robots think, Michael, you should know this.
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.180]   I thought by now you'd be a scholar.
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.500]   - I forgot what I was being humble.
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:14.820]   (laughing)
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.980]   For the sake of the audience.
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.980]   - Humility, everything can teach you something,
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:21.620]   even a robot.
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:26.620]   - Okay, so do you think there's value in religion
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:29.980]   or broader, do you think there's value in myth?
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:32.600]   And as we've been talking about the value of reason,
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.740]   do you think it's possible to argue in society
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:38.460]   as we grow the population of our little island
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:40.940]   that there's some value of common myths,
[00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:43.500]   of common stories, of common religion?
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:44.680]   - There was value.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:47.500]   There is no value today.
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:50.820]   So human beings need explanations, right?
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:53.220]   They need a philosophy to guide their life.
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:56.460]   They need ethics, they need some explanation
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:58.100]   of what's going on in the world, right?
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:01.020]   And it's no accident that the early religions
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:05.300]   had a river god and they had a sun god and a moon god
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.660]   'cause everything they didn't understand,
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:09.420]   they made god, right?
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:10.780]   So they had multiple gods
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.940]   'cause they didn't understand very much.
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:16.020]   As human understanding evolved, increased,
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:18.620]   as we knew reality more, right?
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:20.700]   We came to the conclusion of, you know,
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:22.700]   this is very inefficient to have all these gods.
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:24.700]   This is a genius of Judaism, right?
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:26.780]   Let's just have one bucket to put all the stuff
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.060]   we don't know in and we'll call it one god.
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:31.100]   And then we don't, as we gain new knowledge,
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:33.340]   we can just take it out of the bucket that's god
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:35.240]   and put it into the bucket of science.
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:39.900]   At some point though, at some point,
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.460]   and that point certainly came
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:43.820]   during the scientific revolution, I think,
[00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:46.700]   we could come to the conclusion that no,
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.940]   we don't need this bucket that's called god
[00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:50.980]   to explain the things that we don't know.
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:53.020]   We can say we don't know.
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:55.820]   And we're learning.
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.380]   And slowly, our knowledge is increasing
[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:00.540]   and yet there's a lot more that we don't know,
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.820]   but we don't need to throw it into some bucket
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:05.820]   that's called god in order to have it.
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:07.860]   And I think that's true for morality
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.460]   and it's true for everything else, right?
[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.860]   As we gain the tools to understand what morality requires,
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:15.300]   we don't need a set of commandments.
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.620]   We can figure out morality from human nature
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:18.580]   and from reality.
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:22.660]   So I don't think we need religion anymore.
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:26.980]   I think religion needed to die probably about 200 years ago
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:30.140]   and was dying, I think, up until Kant.
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:31.020]   It seemed to be dying.
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.220]   And one of Kant's missions, as he says,
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:36.180]   is to revive religion against the attack of reason
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:37.180]   and the enlightenment.
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:38.700]   Now, mythology is a little different
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.980]   'cause it depends what you mean by mythology.
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:45.020]   Certainly we need stories and certainly we need art.
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:48.100]   Art is a, and Rand writes about this a lot.
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:50.020]   And she's an artist and she writes,
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:52.500]   I'm a huge fan of "The Romantic Manifesto,"
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:56.100]   which I think is one of her underappreciated masterpieces.
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.140]   - Oh, I hate it.
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.540]   Okay, that's okay.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:03.500]   - Yeah, so I think we have a real need, right?
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:04.860]   As a conceptual being,
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:07.620]   we have a need for aesthetic experiences.
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.700]   We have a need to concretize abstractions,
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:12.460]   to concretize abstract ideas,
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:15.300]   to concretize the complex nature of the world out there.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:18.980]   And that's what painting, sculpture, to an extent music,
[00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:22.060]   but painting, sculpture, literature does for us.
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:25.460]   So to the extent that mythology serves that purpose,
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:27.020]   it's just art, right?
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.780]   To the extent that it serves another purpose,
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:31.340]   that is that it's a way for the gods
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:32.220]   to communicate with us
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:36.020]   or it fits some kind of preexisting mental construct
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:38.100]   that we have as, again, kind of a Kantian perspective,
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.380]   right, that we have these categorical imperatives
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:45.380]   and this mythology links up to that,
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:47.980]   then I think it's false.
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:50.220]   It's not helpful and destructive.
[00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:52.460]   So I believe religion today
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.100]   is a destructive force on planet Earth.
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.900]   I think it's always been a destructive force.
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.540]   It was just a necessary force, right?
[00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.020]   You needed an explanation.
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:01.020]   People needed something to believe in.
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.060]   Once you get philosophy and once you get philosophy
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:05.780]   that starts explaining real life, real world,
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:07.500]   you don't need religion anymore.
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.020]   And indeed, it becomes a destructive force.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:10.820]   And you look around the world today,
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:12.540]   it's an unbelievably destructive force.
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:16.820]   Everywhere it touches is bad for life.
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.420]   Again, mythology depends.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:21.300]   Art is essential, very, very crucial to human existence.
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:22.700]   - I mean, I'd love to hear what you think,
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:26.700]   but you don't see religion and philosophy and mythology
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.980]   as just a continuous spectrum?
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.380]   - Yeah, so religion is a primitive form of philosophy.
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:33.380]   - But I don't think-- - It's pre-philosophical.
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:36.300]   - Where I thought Yaron was gonna go and he didn't go
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:41.300]   was that I think, I agree with what he's gonna say.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:43.580]   Rand was a mythologizer.
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:46.220]   In certain specific contexts, Atlas shrugged as a myth.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:48.140]   It's one thing to sit down and say,
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:50.180]   these are the people who move us forward.
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:52.460]   These are the values that are important.
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:55.220]   When you experience it through a story, through a movie,
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:57.780]   through a TV show, a poem, or a painting,
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:02.020]   it affects you in a very visceral, very different way.
[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.420]   Talk about American history.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.020]   You have the founding fathers,
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.540]   then you have the myth of the founding fathers.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.760]   Now, unfortunately, the term myth often means lie,
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:12.900]   but it could mean, in a useful sense,
[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:17.300]   an abstraction to help you systematize and concretize ideas.
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:18.660]   So you have the myth of Reagan,
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:20.660]   you have the myth of Thatcher.
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.260]   The reality often falls very short.
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:25.900]   But when you look at how these different figures
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:29.700]   are mythologized, not only is it very inspirational
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:33.220]   on a personal level, very motivating on a personal level,
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:36.540]   it's also a great way to concretize ideas
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:37.900]   because just how humans think.
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:39.580]   It's one thing to think about ideas,
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:42.080]   but when you see someone who embodies these ideas,
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.780]   Miss America, I was saying earlier,
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:45.260]   I had an astronaut on my show,
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:46.940]   these people might be jerks,
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:47.860]   but when you look at them,
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:50.780]   one specific aspect of their life and you extrapolate it,
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:53.100]   that can be, to anyone, very motivating.
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:57.700]   And it's very important for people to have the belief
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:00.460]   that happiness and achievement is possible
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:02.180]   'cause it's very hard to keep that in mind,
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:03.380]   especially if you're depressed,
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.040]   if you're anxious, you're unemployed,
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:05.940]   you don't have a girlfriend,
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:07.420]   you think it's gonna be like this forever.
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:09.460]   And then you look at someone's story
[00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:10.380]   and they're like, you know what,
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:12.180]   that astronaut I interviewed, Clayton Anderson,
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.260]   he applied 13 times, didn't get a callback,
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:18.100]   applied the 14th time, got a callback, didn't get the job,
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:20.440]   15th time he get the job, he talks to kids.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:24.840]   And he goes, listen, apply 13 times.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.420]   Even if you don't get the callback,
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.540]   you'll still feel I'm doing something.
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:32.180]   And having heard him and the myth of Clayton Anderson,
[00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:33.860]   this is gonna tell people, yeah, you know what,
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:34.700]   that could be me.
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:35.540]   - Absolutely.
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:37.420]   And it's not just happiness,
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:41.780]   it's the fact that virtue works, that integrity.
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:43.220]   I mean, what's the power of the fountainhead?
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:44.500]   I know you love the fountainhead.
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.420]   Part of the power of the fountainhead is
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:51.420]   Howard Rock's absolute commitment to integrity.
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:55.460]   He is committed to integrity and he's happy, right?
[00:56:55.460 --> 00:57:00.460]   And it's very rare in life to see that,
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.740]   to actually see a concrete of that.
[00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:04.900]   And it's very hard to hold it in your mind.
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:07.500]   Yes, I'm gonna be stuck in the quarry
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.500]   or I'm gonna be stuck doing this horrible job,
[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:12.900]   but if I stick to my principles, I'm gonna be Howard Rock.
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:13.960]   Now I've got that concrete.
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:18.540]   I know I can immediately relate to that success.
[00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:21.020]   So I think art is essential.
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.300]   And I think in a sense,
[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:24.740]   what we do to Thatcher and Reagan is art.
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:27.300]   You have to be careful in true stories,
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:29.300]   not to diverge too far from reality
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:31.420]   'cause then when you discover the reality,
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:32.460]   you don't want to whitewash it.
[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:34.940]   And particularly when it has political implications
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:35.900]   and then it's really bad.
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:37.540]   So particularly with Reagan and Thatcher,
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:38.420]   you have to be careful
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:39.640]   'cause they want anyone near as good
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.740]   as people try to make them out to be.
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:46.180]   But these are powerful, powerful, powerful stories
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.900]   and people are moved by it.
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:51.780]   And the integration of emotion with reason is crucial, right?
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:54.120]   One of the goals to be happy
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:57.620]   is to bring your emotions in line with your thinking.
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:00.300]   And I think that stories and arts more broadly.
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:03.020]   And when I go and see Michelangelo's David,
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:04.460]   it does the same thing to me.
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:08.860]   I can stand up to anybody 'cause he did and look,
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:12.900]   he succeeded and it makes sense that he could, right?
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.340]   - So there's a really interesting idea
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:17.140]   of bringing your emotion in line
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.060]   with your thinking, with your reasoning.
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:22.140]   So Ben Shapiro famously has this saying,
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:24.280]   how do you like that transition, Michael?
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.240]   You give me props?
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:26.080]   I know you do.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.240]   - He's not Ben, it's Ben Shapiro.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.440]   - Yeah.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.600]   - Someone is not taking your calls.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.440]   - Benny.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:34.200]   - I guess it's the daily don't take the caller.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.720]   - Back to the island with the murder.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:38.560]   I think we know--
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.400]   - Murder island.
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:42.160]   - We would know who would be committing the murder.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.280]   I have the suit for it.
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:48.840]   So he has the saying of facts don't care about your feelings
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:53.500]   and that always, I've always felt badly
[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:56.420]   about that statement somehow, like it was incomplete.
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:58.940]   So it's interesting too that you mentioned
[00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:01.740]   bringing your emotions in line with your thinking.
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:03.860]   Like what do you think about that statement?
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:05.180]   - I got this one.
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:06.540]   What Ben is doing--
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:07.380]   - Ben.
[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:10.760]   - Ben, what he's doing in a loose way
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:14.100]   is attacking Kantianism 'cause Kant,
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:17.220]   there's this, it's almost impossible for Westerners
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.340]   who aren't schooled in this to understand
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:21.300]   the idea of philosophical idealism
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:23.580]   'cause it sounds so crazy that you're like,
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:26.380]   these great minds of all time can't really be saying this.
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:27.580]   I must be missing something.
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:29.740]   So the idea of, when we hear idealism,
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:31.120]   we think John F. Kennedy, right?
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.260]   It's an example.
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:35.500]   You aspire things, you think life could be better than it is.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:38.020]   That's not what it means in a philosophical sense.
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:41.560]   In philosophical idealism, it means ideas
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:43.620]   are more real than reality.
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:46.820]   That I have this idea, then this comes along.
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:49.580]   It's the reality that isn't correct.
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:50.580]   My idea is still correct.
[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:52.140]   A good example of this that you see all the time
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:54.980]   on the internet is when they refer to Mitt Romney
[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:58.580]   and John McCain as rhinos, Republicans in name only.
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.660]   And it's like, who is more a real Republican?
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:04.700]   The nominee of the party, the senator,
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.980]   the governor of the party, or some person in your mind
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.780]   who has never existed and there's no evidence
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:10.940]   for them existing?
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:14.180]   So what Kant did is he bifurcated reality
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:17.340]   into what we see around us, the phenomenal world,
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.260]   but then it's inferior.
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:23.420]   The real world, the noumenal world, we can't access it.
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:27.560]   Because we have eyes, we only see the thing as it appears,
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.300]   not as it is in itself.
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:31.220]   And because of this, everything we know
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:33.100]   is a shadow and is secondary.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:33.940]   - And that's Plato, right?
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:35.020]   - Yeah. - Straight out of Plato.
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:38.260]   - Right, and the real reality is this realm of ideas.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:41.060]   So when Ben is saying facts don't care about your feelings,
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:45.220]   what he is really saying is reality comes first,
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:48.700]   your feelings have to be a response or a reaction to it.
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.600]   You can't say this is how I feel.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.140]   This table doesn't care.
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.980]   You can yell at it all day long,
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.180]   it will still be indifferent to your emotional state
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:57.460]   because it comes first.
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:59.180]   - So it's a great statement.
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:01.180]   I think he's cribbing it from Ayn Rand in a sense.
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:03.020]   And I-- - I love it, yes.
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:04.380]   - There's a sense in which he is.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:06.660]   I mean, who popularized that kind of idea?
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:09.340]   And Ben has read Ayn Rand quite extensively.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.460]   - Not enough. - Not enough.
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:11.300]   - Well.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.540]   - Not enough to reference her.
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:15.540]   - He does wear the yarmulke, so yeah, obviously.
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:18.100]   He may be read enough but didn't understand enough.
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:21.820]   But so-- - Shot fired.
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:25.820]   - It's absolutely reality, reality is unaffected
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:29.220]   by your emotional state and your feelings about it.
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:32.340]   And this is a great claim against the idealism,
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:35.620]   the philosophical idealism of much of the world out there,
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:36.500]   both left and right.
[01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.240]   I think politically, culturally,
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.300]   the left and right are detached from reality.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:43.140]   They live in a different dimension, in a different space
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:45.220]   that they are creating in their own minds
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:47.060]   that has nothing to do with the real world.
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.400]   And when they fail, they make stuff up
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.660]   to justify their failure, right?
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:56.620]   So this is, you know, all of really the ideas
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:59.380]   that are promulgated today on both sides
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:02.340]   are this kind of detached from reality.
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:07.220]   We're putting emotions or ideas before reality itself.
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:11.300]   But I believe that, you know, emotions are responses.
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:13.700]   They're responses to reality
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:17.460]   conditioned by our existing concepts.
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:19.660]   - You're gonna have to talk slowly to talk emotions to Lex
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:20.700]   'cause he doesn't really understand what that is.
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.320]   - I don't understand.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.260]   - So really, you gotta really--
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:25.740]   - But he's big on love.
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:26.860]   - What is love?
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.260]   - But he's big on love.
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:29.100]   - He's trying to learn.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.600]   - Pretty big on love, I'm all in, I'm a love maximalist.
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.580]   I mean, I could create, we could create an environment
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:38.100]   on this island where you would really feel emotions.
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.540]   Like fear is an emotion.
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:42.660]   - That's the metaphysical terror.
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:45.260]   - We could easily terrorize you to the point
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:47.220]   where you felt fear, right?
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.700]   So we could teach him about emotion.
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.300]   But emotions are response to reality.
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.300]   So some people, for example,
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.220]   you could take five different people
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:55.660]   and show them exactly the same thing.
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:57.220]   And some of them would feel fear
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:00.580]   and some of them would actually, you know, feel indifferent
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.620]   and other people might feel love, right?
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.700]   - I think Leonard Picoff uses the example
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:08.060]   of looking through a microscope and seeing a,
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:11.380]   I don't know, a virus or bacteria.
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:13.860]   And for one, it's a scientist, he's made a new discovery.
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:17.460]   He feels pride and love and, you know,
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.060]   the one has no clue, right?
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.020]   And he's looking at this and it means nothing to them
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:23.940]   and somebody else might look at it and, you know,
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:25.740]   it's a bacteria, you know, and they feel fear
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:27.360]   because of what it could do to them.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.380]   So it's conditioned by what you know,
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:33.340]   what your values are and your level of knowledge
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.820]   and what the thing is out there in reality.
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.900]   And it's that into, so your emotions respond to that.
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:44.580]   So aligning your emotions with your reason
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:49.100]   is making sure that your emotions are really conditioned
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.900]   by what you know explicitly
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:53.860]   versus what you've internalized implicitly
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:55.820]   that you might not agree with anymore.
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:58.780]   You know, things might happen in your childhood
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:00.620]   and they probably do, right?
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:02.940]   Where you get a trauma, I don't know,
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:07.940]   I'm afraid of dogs and maybe when I was a five-year-old,
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:11.340]   some dogs jumped me and I don't even remember it, right?
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:13.260]   But I came to a conclusion when I was five,
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:15.980]   dogs bad, dogs dangerous, right?
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:17.740]   And now anytime I see a dog, oh my God,
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:21.260]   that bringing my emotions aligned with reality, right?
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:24.340]   With my ideas is, no, now I understand dogs
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:27.740]   don't have to be scary, I can work through this
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.460]   and there are various techniques and hopefully
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:32.140]   if there is such a science of psychology,
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:34.660]   but in psychology to get you to the point
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.900]   where you can get rid of that fear
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:40.340]   and align your emotion now with your explicit ideas
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:41.180]   and that's what I mean by that.
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:42.820]   - And let me build on that,
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:44.260]   talking about your friend Putin,
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:46.260]   I think I mentioned this before, maybe on the show,
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:47.700]   he was meeting with Angela Merkel.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:48.540]   - Oh, Vladimir, please.
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:50.820]   - Yeah, Vlad, my boy Vlad.
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.340]   He was meeting with Angela Merkel.
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:54.980]   Angela Merkel has a fear of dogs.
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:57.380]   So he brought out his big Labrador retriever.
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:58.260]   Now for people who don't know,
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.300]   Labradors are very big dogs,
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.900]   but they're also like the least aggressive.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:04.660]   It's like you could punch them in the face, they don't care.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:08.740]   That dog is not going to be more likely to attack
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:10.260]   just because she's scared.
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:12.740]   And I know they say animals can sense fear,
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:15.340]   domesticated dogs, if they see you're scared,
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:16.540]   they're not gonna be aggressive.
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.620]   They're gonna try to, I remember when I was a kid,
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.140]   I will never forget, there was this dog, Rex,
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:23.740]   this German shepherd, I'm five, this dog is gigantic.
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:24.900]   And I'm sitting on the couch,
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:26.700]   the German shepherds have been bred for intelligence.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.540]   They're very bright dogs, they're very good with kids.
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:31.860]   He's sitting next to me, this thing is three times my size,
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:36.180]   he very gently puts his paw on my leg to be like, kid,
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:38.340]   like he can sense my fear, he's like, I'm not gonna do it.
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:39.580]   Like, I wanna be your friend.
[01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:40.740]   I'm still freaking out.
[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:43.580]   He licks my hand, it's just very scary.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:44.660]   You know, animals are so bright,
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:45.700]   but that's the thing is,
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:48.260]   in terms of facts don't care about your feelings,
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:51.580]   that dog is not more likely to attack someone
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.100]   because their emotion is so intense.
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:57.740]   It's not that I feel something very strongly,
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:00.940]   therefore this thing is more likely to happen.
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:05.940]   So my intensity of my emotion does not in any way correlate
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:07.180]   when you're being irrational
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:09.300]   to the likelihood of that thing actually happening.
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.420]   - No, you could have a dog
[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.980]   that does respond to your emotion.
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:12.820]   - Oh, of course.
[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:14.420]   - Right, but then it's not--
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:15.260]   - It's not responding that way.
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:16.660]   - But then that's part of reality, right?
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:17.820]   That's a fact of reality
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.860]   that certain dogs respond to certain emotions.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:23.540]   - But isn't this emotion a part of reality?
[01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:25.260]   Like, okay, let me say a word.
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:27.580]   - Yeah, so part of that, I would even say,
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:30.420]   don't let your emotion about your emotion, right?
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.220]   'Cause sometimes you have an emotion about your emotion.
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:33.060]   - Don't be repressed.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:38.060]   - Don't be repressed, and identify the emotion as reality.
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:41.180]   And evaluate it, don't judge it, evaluate it.
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:42.460]   Is it a rational emotion?
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.260]   Is it consistent with my, like,
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:47.240]   if I'm afraid of these dogs, if I feel that fear,
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:49.180]   is it rational to be afraid of these dogs?
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:52.180]   - But you're speaking to your own individual trajectory
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.100]   as a human being as you grow through the world
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.340]   and try to understand reality
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.100]   and connect yourself through reason to reality.
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:01.700]   What I'm talking about is a term like lived experience.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:06.700]   When you observe and analyze the,
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:09.540]   you know, conversations with other people
[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:12.980]   to try to understand how other people see the world,
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:16.500]   doesn't emotion fundamentally integrate into that?
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.100]   Like, is an emotion lived experience?
[01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:22.080]   So everybody experiences the same reality,
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.580]   but the way they experience it might be very different,
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:26.620]   and that has to do with what?
[01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:28.860]   - With their values, with their conclusions,
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:30.780]   with their ideas, with their experiences,
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:31.820]   with a million different things.
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.420]   - But is it-- - But at the end of the day,
[01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:35.100]   it's about the conclusions that they come to,
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:37.140]   which are then shaping their emotions.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:38.580]   But look, emotions are not something
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:40.260]   to be avoided or ignored.
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.940]   That is, I can sense your emotions to some extent.
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:44.260]   - That's a lie. - Right?
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.300]   (laughing)
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.300]   Okay, it is Lex.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.340]   I can sense his emotions.
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:49.860]   I can sense Michael's emotions,
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.140]   and that's part of the facts of reality, right?
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:55.340]   So if Michael responds to something
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:58.180]   that I view as really, really important, right?
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:01.260]   If we were standing in front of Michelangelo's David,
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:03.340]   and Michael responds to Michelangelo's David,
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:06.620]   who goes, "Nah," and turned his back to it and walked away,
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:09.020]   that would be really meaningful to me, right?
[01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:10.660]   That I would respond emotionally to that,
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.020]   and cognitively I would say,
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:16.320]   "What is it about Michael that makes him respond this way?
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.900]   "That gives me a lot of information about him."
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:22.300]   So emotions are information-laden, right?
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:24.900]   But they are not primary.
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:28.980]   They are responses, responses to something.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:31.620]   So one must be very aware of one's own emotions,
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:34.340]   recognize them, and analyze them,
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.180]   and one should be aware of other people's emotions,
[01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:38.020]   if they're important to you.
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:39.860]   If they're not important to you, it doesn't matter, right?
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:41.660]   You don't care about a stranger's emotion.
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:43.740]   Yeah, like a stranger walks up to Michelangelo's David
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:45.060]   and says, "Eh," and walks away,
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:47.340]   then I go, "Okay, I'm glad you're a stranger."
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:49.580]   (laughing)
[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:53.620]   Now, I'm not sure what Michael's response
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:55.460]   to Michelangelo's David was or is,
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:57.700]   so I'm a little worried about what he's gonna say.
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.260]   You got candy too, that was great.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:01.300]   (laughing)
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:02.140]   Do I get Ukrainian candy?
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:03.220]   I thought I was special.
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:04.060]   I can't read either.
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:06.260]   What's this say, Joshua, what does that say to him?
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:07.740]   Is this Ukrainian candy as well?
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:08.580]   I thought it was sent to me.
[01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:10.220]   Do you know that Atlas Shrugged
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:13.660]   was the best-selling book in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016?
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:15.900]   Do you know Atlas Shrugged was translated to Russian
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:17.880]   by someone who's now a crypto billionaire,
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.740]   and he made six copies, and I have one of them,
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:20.580]   and I sent it to my great-grandma.
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:21.740]   No, there were more than six,
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:23.340]   but yeah, 'cause I have a copy too.
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:24.180]   Okay.
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:25.420]   Not I personally, they instituted a copy.
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:26.940]   I sent it to my great-grandma,
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.460]   and she said, "Why is he sending me this?
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:29.740]   "I wanna read books about love."
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:30.580]   And I'm like, you know what?
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:31.400]   It's just about love.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.240]   (laughing)
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.020]   That's what you should have said.
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:34.900]   What's that, is that say?
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:38.420]   So this says it's (speaking in foreign language)
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.260]   It has vitamins and minerals.
[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.100]   It, there's a bunch of--
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:42.500]   If it's in Russian, I don't believe it.
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.460]   (laughing)
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:45.780]   It just sounds really--
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:46.620]   (laughing)
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:48.220]   It sounds really strange to read
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.820]   like health information in Russian.
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:50.660]   There you go, exactly.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:51.500]   I'm already distressed--
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.540]   Look, there's a Yorshik like you have.
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:54.380]   Exactly.
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:58.500]   I mean, I like Kiev much more than I like Moscow.
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.060]   Wow, strong words.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.700]   But this is not, it's like hard candy.
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:03.540]   I don't know.
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:04.940]   I think this, some of my friends sent me
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:07.260]   that's made with blood to give the kids iron.
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:08.100]   Whose blood?
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:09.020]   Like cow blood.
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:09.840]   Oh.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.680]   Like with chocolate.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.520]   All right.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:12.340]   You can keep it.
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:13.180]   (laughing)
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:14.000]   It's all you.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:14.840]   All right, I'm keeping both of these.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.500]   But can I speak to something
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.180]   you're talking about with emotion?
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:21.620]   Something that is very pernicious in terms of emotion
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:24.340]   is people denying the validity of their own emotions.
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:25.960]   And here's one example.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:28.060]   Someone could be in an abusive relationship
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:29.620]   or had an abusive childhood.
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:32.780]   And they think, well, I didn't have a black eye.
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:33.820]   We had dinner on the table.
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:34.660]   It wasn't abusive.
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:35.920]   'Cause you hear some other story.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:38.140]   So they feel their emotion isn't valid.
[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:40.940]   Or like, oh, he never lays hands on me.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.700]   He gets drunk and is mean to me.
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:44.580]   He's still basically a good person.
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:46.200]   You're denying that emotion.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.140]   And that emotion is a response to something real.
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:50.160]   There's an expression,
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.120]   I have friends who are in 12-step programs.
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:55.080]   There's an expression there, which I think is very profound,
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.620]   which is if it's hysterical, it's historical.
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.420]   Meaning if some minor incident
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:03.340]   is having an extreme disproportionate impact on you,
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:05.560]   think, ask yourself, why am I responding
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.080]   in such an extreme way to some minor thing?
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.300]   And I will tell you, 10 times out of 10,
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:11.960]   you'll go back and you'll be like,
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.160]   oh, I'm feeling now like I felt when I was eight
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.940]   and my dad came home and he was a total jerk
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.140]   and I didn't do anything wrong and he thought I had
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:21.620]   and I was completely powerless.
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:23.440]   And now I'm in the same situation my boss.
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:24.400]   I'm not that eight-year-old.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.320]   In one sense, I am, in another sense, I'm not.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.560]   But I feel the same way I did as a kid.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.380]   And this is a very useful mechanism
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:32.340]   in terms of furthering one's happiness
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:34.280]   'cause you kind of deprogram all those things
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.280]   that you've picked up as a child.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:38.640]   - But it's also, if you're feeling something wrong,
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.760]   even though you're trying to rationalize it in a way,
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:42.700]   it's not abusive 'cause he's not hitting me.
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.680]   No, the emotion is telling you something real
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.080]   about what's going on.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:49.720]   So acknowledge it and fix the situation, right?
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.160]   So one of the powers emotions give you
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:54.400]   is they send you signals about something
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.920]   that might not be in cognition yet.
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.500]   And when you examine the emotion,
[01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:01.480]   it brings it to cognition and now you can act on it.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.240]   So maybe the boss is abusive,
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.600]   but I didn't really think of it in those terms.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.640]   And my emotions is sending me signals.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.600]   And now that I signal it, I'm gonna resign.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.240]   I'm gonna find a better, another job.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.040]   I'm gonna complain to his boss or whatever.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.660]   I'm gonna take action.
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.760]   - Why do you think Ayn Rand is such a controversial figure?
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.040]   Last time I spoke with you on this particular podcast,
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.880]   the amount of emails I've gotten,
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.640]   positive and negative, and certainly negative.
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:28.960]   I don't usually get negative emails.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:29.960]   - Yeah, but you did.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.000]   - Yeah, I can't relate.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.460]   I'm sure mine were only positive.
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:37.360]   - It was mostly women sending pictures
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.200]   for me to forward to you.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.960]   - And you didn't send me any of them.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:43.160]   - Oh, it's the wrong email address.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.080]   I kept bouncing.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:45.920]   I was looking at your email.
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.080]   - Oh, so this is love.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.320]   (laughing)
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:51.840]   - Love hurts.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:52.680]   Okay.
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.500]   - Yes, no, I--
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.400]   - But why do you think she's such a divisive figure?
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.000]   Why do you think that she provokes such emotion
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.560]   in both the positive and the negative side?
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.280]   I'd love to hear both of your viewpoints on this.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.960]   - Well, I think on the negative side,
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.560]   and both on the positive and the negative side,
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:08.040]   I think it's because she's radical.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.200]   She's consistently radical.
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:15.200]   She upends the premises, the ideas
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.920]   that are prevalent in the culture,
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:20.520]   that were brought up on, that are like, you know,
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:24.440]   they're like milk and, you know,
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.600]   the basic stuff that we're growing up.
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.640]   You have to be altruistic.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.960]   You have to live for other people.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.160]   That's just basic stuff.
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.160]   Nobody challenges that.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.200]   Nobody questions it.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.480]   And if they do question it,
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.960]   they usually question it from the perspective
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:38.760]   of a cynic or a bad guy, right?
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.760]   You mentioned the Joker, right?
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:41.600]   Before we started, right?
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.360]   That, you know, I'm gonna upend the world
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.320]   because I don't care about other people, right?
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.480]   So they're presented with these two alternatives
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.640]   and it's real in people's lives, right?
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:54.640]   You either live for other people or you're a evil SOB.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.680]   And, you know, yeah, most people are neither one of those,
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.680]   but the ethic is right here.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.960]   It's living for other people.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.240]   And when you challenge that,
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.440]   they have no way cognitively to go with that.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.560]   And the only place they can go with that cognitively
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.560]   is to the Joker.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.840]   It's the evil guy.
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.520]   It's the somebody who wants to smash everything
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:12.360]   and destroy it.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.280]   Because they don't have this alternative conception of,
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.760]   oh no, you can be rationally self-interested
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:20.480]   and that does not involve destruction
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.520]   and that does not involve, you know,
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.360]   exploiting other people.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.280]   They can't conceptualize that.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.680]   It's not in their framework.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.200]   So it's the fact that she's so consistently
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.160]   on the side of self-interest, for example,
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:37.480]   on the side of capitalism, on the side of freedom.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.600]   It's the fact that she dismisses faith
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.040]   to the extent that she does or to the extent that I do.
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.920]   That alienates people 'cause that is completely different
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:47.840]   from what they brought up.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.720]   Now, the flip side of that is,
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.800]   it's also really interesting to some people.
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.400]   So, you know, a lot of, you got some positives, right?
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.680]   And I got a lot of positives from that appearance.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.640]   I know a lot of people came to my podcast
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.120]   because I appeared on your show.
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:02.960]   Why?
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:05.800]   Because they hear something that's completely fresh,
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:08.960]   new, different, they've never heard before.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:12.200]   It appeals to something in them that maybe, you know,
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.760]   a lot of people say, I read Ayn Rand
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.560]   and it confirmed everything I believed.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.440]   Now, for me, it didn't.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:17.400]   It was the opposite.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.760]   It turned upside down everything I believed.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.360]   But there are a lot of people out there
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.920]   that have a sense that something's wrong in the world,
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.240]   that altruism is wrong, that socialism,
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.560]   just the stuff and religion is wrong,
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:29.840]   but they don't have an alternative.
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.000]   It hasn't coalesced.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.600]   And they listen to a lot of podcasts
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.200]   'cause they're trying to get ideas of what is it,
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.240]   what is it that I'm sensing that's wrong out there?
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.440]   And suddenly somebody comes out
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:41.960]   and gives them some clear explanation of things.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:43.280]   And they go, wow,
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.160]   that's what I've been looking for my whole life.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:48.160]   So that's the positive for people.
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:52.840]   You know, and I read Ayn Rand, it just all made sense.
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:57.440]   It all clicked and it made clear
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.920]   that everything I believed to that point was just wrong.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.120]   It just didn't integrate.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.640]   And I always knew to some extent it didn't integrate,
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:06.200]   but there was no alternative, so I believed it.
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:07.200]   What else was there?
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:10.560]   I remember saying to myself as a kid, probably 15,
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:13.680]   why should I, why is morality all about other people?
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.360]   Why is that?
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.840]   Well, that's just the way it is, right?
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.960]   And I couldn't come up with an explanation.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.440]   She gave me the explanation
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.240]   and she gave me the explanation why it's wrong to do that.
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.680]   And I think, so I think that's why people respond.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.280]   It's just too radical.
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:30.480]   It can't fit into their cognitive framework
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.760]   that they're being brought up on,
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.000]   that they've been educated on,
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.640]   that just their whole life revolves around.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.720]   - Michael, you don't bring up Ayn Rand
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:39.040]   that much in conversation,
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.240]   except as kind of references every once in a while
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:43.840]   as part of the humor of just the general flow
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.880]   and the music of the way you like to talk.
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:49.640]   Well, why do you think you don't integrate her
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.120]   into your philosophy when you're like explaining ideas
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.360]   and all those kinds of things?
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.200]   Like, why is she not, you know,
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:01.040]   a popular reference point for discussion of ideas?
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.800]   - Because I don't know if you're everyone's gonna agree with
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.360]   or can agree with me.
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.680]   I think for a certain percentage of the population,
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.720]   actually I talked to someone from the Ayn Rand Institute,
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.320]   I forgot his name, older guy with glasses,
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.640]   and he didn't disagree with me.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.560]   He said, this is changing.
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.120]   I said, I think for a certain percentage of the population
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.800]   who are uninformed about her work,
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.240]   higher than 10%, less than 50%, you mentioned Ayn Rand,
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.560]   they have been trained to think
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.480]   this is identical Scientology.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:26.880]   So as soon as her name comes up,
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.560]   it's like, okay, I'm out the door.
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.360]   I'm not gonna have anything to do with this.
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:31.920]   And everyone who follows her is a crazy person.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.680]   That's one thing that has happened.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.880]   Another thing is Rand in her personality
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.040]   was very aggressive and antagonistic.
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:43.920]   She was for a long time, the lone voice in the wilderness,
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.440]   being like, this isn't like,
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.760]   like one of her big adversaries in a certain sense
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.920]   is Milton Friedman.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:53.440]   And she really hated how Milton Friedman was like,
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.520]   oh, you know, having rent control is inefficient.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.240]   And she's like, inefficient?
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.240]   We're talking about mass homelessness and people dying.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.720]   And you're talking about this,
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.720]   like what color tie goes with this color shirt?
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:09.760]   Are you in, like, and in fact, it's hilarious.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:10.680]   There was an organization called
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.680]   the Foundation for Economic Education, FEE.
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.320]   Leonard Reed was the head of this.
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.840]   And there were a series of letters and she was helping him.
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.760]   She was much more philosophically grounded
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.440]   in certain contexts than he was.
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.080]   And there was an essay, a pamphlet that he published
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.360]   called "Roofs or Ceilings."
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.920]   It was co-written by Milton Friedman,
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:30.960]   later Nobel Prize winner,
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.760]   and George Stigler, also later Nobel Prize winner.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:35.840]   And basically the argument was,
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:38.760]   well, if the government controls all housing,
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:40.160]   how's that going to work out?
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:43.720]   And she's sitting there and she's typing in all caps.
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:46.800]   So, you know, she's holding on the shift key and doing this.
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:47.640]   - On a typewriter.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.600]   - On a typewriter and being like, how?
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:53.200]   And you can imagine her with her cigarette holder,
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:57.160]   apoplectic, being like, how is an organization,
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:00.680]   ostensibly devoted to free enterprise,
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:05.680]   discussing this Stalinist idea in the most casual of terms?
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:07.200]   She's like, have I taught you not?
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:10.200]   And what's amazing is, so at FEE,
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:13.720]   they only have her letters because she sent them to Reed.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:16.280]   The Ayn Rand Institute must have Leonard Reed's letters.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.320]   I was able to, knowing Rand enough,
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:21.200]   predict exactly what the conversation would go like
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.520]   because he also did something she didn't approve of,
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:27.040]   which is he asked other people for feedback on her work
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:29.480]   and she goes, I gave this to you to read.
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:31.400]   Who are you shopping around to some jerk
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.040]   that I don't, I need their approval, what are you doing?
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:36.720]   So it was a very interesting situation.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.200]   But, so that's one issue.
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:40.440]   - Now remember, this is Ayn Rand when she's young.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.280]   - She wasn't that young.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.160]   - Well, I mean, she's relatively young, right?
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.320]   It's before Atlas Shrugged.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:45.160]   - It was before Atlas Shrugged.
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.440]   - So it's before she's super famous
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:49.400]   and before this is, the found has been published,
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:54.400]   but, you know, she's trying to work with others
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:57.000]   and they're disappointing her left and right.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.880]   - Yeah, so, and also when you are a,
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:04.160]   what she takes away from bad people
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.520]   is you have these kids, right?
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:07.920]   And you're gonna sit down with them
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.280]   and they're gonna be like, yeah, I'm gonna take your guns,
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.800]   I'm gonna lock you in your house,
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.280]   I'm gonna take 60% of your income and all this other stuff.
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:18.920]   And they might, up to reading Rand,
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.920]   they might sit down and have a discussion
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:23.280]   and Rand goes, hey, you know what?
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.160]   You didn't have to give them an answer.
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.000]   You could say, go to hell,
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.800]   we're not having this conversation
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.720]   and you have no right to one second of my life
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:35.360]   and this is not a legitimate opener.
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.720]   This is a declaration of war.
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.920]   This isn't like, it's not like if I sit down with you,
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:41.560]   I run like, hey, Ron, here are my plans for your wife.
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.400]   Go to hell.
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:43.720]   This isn't a conversation we're having.
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:45.320]   Oh, I'm gonna make you unsafe in your house.
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:46.160]   What?
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.000]   This is not a discussion.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.320]   So what happens is these people who five minutes ago
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.120]   were able to have a debate with this kid
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.120]   'cause people read Rand when they're young often.
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.960]   And now that kid is like, yeah, I'm not even talking to you.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:58.200]   It's her fault.
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.800]   Whereas in reality, it's that person's fault
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.040]   because that person had no right,
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:03.880]   although they've been trained
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:05.440]   to the contrary of our culture,
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.200]   to believe, yeah, I'm gonna sit down
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.800]   and we're just gonna equally have a discussion
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.800]   over our own life and you have one vote
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:12.920]   and I have one vote and we're gonna,
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.880]   and Lex has a vote and that's just how it's gonna be.
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:15.960]   Like, this is madness. - No, it's Lex.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.880]   - And Rand's not having it.
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:19.480]   So I think those are two issues.
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:20.560]   And there's some other things
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.080]   which I don't need to get into,
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:25.880]   but one of the things that Rand said consistently
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:28.000]   in her life is that her philosophy
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.840]   is an integrated whole, right?
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.360]   So to be an objectivist isn't just like,
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.600]   I like Atlas Shrugged.
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.920]   It means I accept objectivism as a totality.
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:40.560]   Since I do not, I think it is proper
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.680]   to be respectful to her wishes and not constantly be,
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:45.440]   especially given that I have somewhat of a platform
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:47.000]   to be like Ayn Rand, Ayn Rand, Ayn Rand,
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.480]   because I don't think Ayn Rand would have liked it
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.560]   if I was talking about Ayn Rand this much.
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:54.200]   - So how do you deprogram?
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:55.840]   'Cause I don't like to bring up Ayn Rand
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.000]   just because I do see what,
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.880]   like how people roll their eyes, essentially.
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.040]   So how do-- - What's the upside?
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:03.120]   - What's the upside, exactly?
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:06.640]   But what is that, can you speak to that programming
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:07.480]   that people have? - I think you're
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:08.560]   unprogramming people.
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.640]   I mean, look, at the end of the day,
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:12.600]   if you talk about the ideas and the ideas make sense
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.080]   and people are attracted to the ideas,
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.560]   then you say, oh, by the way, and this came from Ayn Rand,
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.520]   that's how you deprogram them, right?
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.560]   If you make the ideas prevalent in the culture,
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.840]   if people start viewing self-interest
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:25.800]   as something that's interesting and worthwhile
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.440]   and something worth investigating,
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.200]   and they said, oh, that came from Ayn Rand,
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:33.240]   then I think that we'll deprogram them
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:36.280]   and get them changing their minds about these things.
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:40.080]   And also, going on shows where people are gonna watch
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.080]   your show no matter who you bring on, right?
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:44.680]   So even though, now you do,
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:47.720]   if you put Ayn Rand in the title,
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:50.540]   that immediately reduces the number of people who watch.
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:52.320]   So in the future, you shouldn't.
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.880]   - You put Michael Malice in the title
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.800]   and then at least the female population too.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.280]   - The female, absolutely.
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.400]   - It's just to see.
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.320]   - That's right.
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:02.200]   So you go and you try to make them as credible as possible
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:04.160]   to as many people as possible over time.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:05.000]   It takes time.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.880]   And ultimately, I don't think the culture
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.400]   will have this response to her.
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.960]   They might still disagree with her,
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:12.160]   but I think over time, and already you're seeing it,
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.840]   younger people, I think today, are far less.
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:17.680]   There was a generation who never read Ayn Rand
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:19.920]   and was like this, bring out the garlic and the crosses,
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:21.320]   we don't wanna have anything to do with her.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:24.160]   Then, and I think today, there are many more people
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.440]   who've read her and might disagree or not disagree, right?
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:28.660]   And then there were a lot of people who haven't read her,
[01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:30.080]   but who are not opposed to it
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:32.200]   or willing to engage.
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.960]   So I think it's changing already.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.520]   And I think in 20 years, it'll be completely different.
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.040]   - And just two more things that she does
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.720]   that I think it says that I think people find
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.880]   very, very off-putting given our culture.
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.680]   One is she will, basically, you could sit down with Rand
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:46.960]   and be like, your fear is not in any way
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.600]   a hold on my freedom.
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:49.880]   Just that one sentence.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.760]   And for a lot of people, that's very off-putting
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:55.680]   and very harsh, it's correct.
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.200]   But for them, it's just like, wait a minute,
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.040]   I'm still scared.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.280]   It's like, I don't care.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.520]   Like, for example, like with lockdowns and things like this.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.320]   It's like, well, I'm scared
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:05.760]   and maybe I have a right to be scared.
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:06.600]   - Ah, gotcha.
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.280]   - Or like, I'm scared that you have a gun in your house.
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:10.600]   And it's like, I respect that you're scared.
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.040]   I don't care.
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:14.000]   As you say, at the end of the day, this is my house.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.240]   I'm going to live my life as I please
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.560]   as long as I don't hurt other people.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.080]   Well, you are hurting me 'cause I'm scared.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.320]   No, that's not--
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.960]   - This is the feeling versus fact.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:22.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.480]   So that is one situation where--
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:26.120]   - It's like a feeling versus freedom, essentially.
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:30.760]   - Yes, where Rand, I mean, puts a lot of people off.
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:34.480]   I also think that historically,
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.200]   a lot of people who are drawn to her
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.280]   are drawn to her for the wrong reasons.
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:42.880]   That a lot of times, like Howard Rourke, the hero,
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:43.880]   we're going to still say hero.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:45.480]   You're supposed to say protagonist, but hero.
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:49.320]   The hero of The Fountainhead, he's extremely intelligent,
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:51.600]   but he's also extremely uncompromising.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.360]   What often ends up happening is you'll have a young kid
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:55.840]   who is somewhat intelligent,
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.640]   but then they pick up the personality,
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.440]   and now you're someone I can't work with.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.080]   And then it's like, you're not Howard Rourke.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:03.560]   Relax, you're not that skilled, you're not that talented.
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:06.120]   But because the character has to be a personification
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:08.520]   and have certain aspects together,
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.480]   when kids read that, they might get the wrong idea.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:11.320]   That's not Rand's fault.
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.400]   - And it's more than that.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:16.680]   It's so, so, I completely agree with that,
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:18.400]   but it's even broader than that.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.640]   So here is, in my view, one of the geniuses of the millennium
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:24.200]   presenting a philosophy.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.840]   And she's got not just the questions,
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.000]   in my view, she's got the answers.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.360]   And you're reading them at 16, and you're reading the answers.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.440]   You don't know at 16 that this is true.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:34.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.320]   - You might have a sense that it's true,
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.600]   but you don't have the life experience,
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:38.000]   the learned experience.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.200]   You don't have the facts, you don't have the knowledge.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.440]   You're picking up truth.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.240]   It's just being absorbed.
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:46.000]   You're accepting it as true, but you don't know it's true.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.040]   And then you go out into the world advocating for it,
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:52.400]   which we all did, or at least I did, when I was 16.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:53.840]   And you're obnoxious.
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:56.520]   You can't prove what you're arguing for,
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:57.960]   because you don't have the experience.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.920]   So it took me, I don't know, 10, 20 years, probably 20,
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.600]   to figure out that I really do think
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.440]   what she said was true.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:06.880]   But I didn't know when I was 16.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:09.840]   When I was 16, I just absorbed these ideas
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.640]   and accepted them in a sense,
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:16.240]   with some connection to reality, but in a sense, unfaith.
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:17.960]   At least presented it that way.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:22.320]   And as a consequence, you come off as a detached
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:26.280]   from reality, obnoxious human being.
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:28.240]   I think a lot of young objectivists are,
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:30.600]   and it's hard not to be, because you are.
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:32.240]   You're confronted with genius.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.120]   And you're not a genius.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.480]   I certainly am not a genius.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.240]   And I'm confronted with just genius,
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:38.440]   and I have all this information in my head now.
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:39.680]   I can't articulate it.
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:43.200]   And it's hard to deal with yourself.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:44.040]   There's an inside joke.
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.560]   - No, you said I'm confronted with genius, I point to us.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:48.440]   - Yeah, yes, I mean, I'm confronted with you guys.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.320]   I'm at an age where I know how to deal with geniuses.
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.520]   - But I'm gonna say, there's something else.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.920]   This is not why people don't like her,
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.560]   but there's something that the Fountainhead does,
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:00.040]   which I think is very, and I don't blame her,
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:01.840]   but it's a bad consequence.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:03.440]   If you read the Fountainhead and you're young
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.240]   and you're intelligent and talented,
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:07.760]   the message, at least I got, and I know I'm not alone,
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:10.680]   is you are going to think that you're gonna be a pariah,
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:12.800]   that a lot of people are gonna be against you,
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.800]   and you're basically doomed for a short period
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.800]   of being isolated and alone.
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.040]   And that may have been the case
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:20.520]   when Fountainhead was written.
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:21.880]   But I think now with the internet,
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:23.920]   and in my experience, both as a youth
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:25.920]   and someone who's a little bit older,
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:26.960]   I didn't appreciate,
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.200]   and you're not gonna get it from that book,
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:29.440]   and you can't get it through that book
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:31.080]   'cause it has to have a certain narrative,
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:34.960]   how many people who are a little older are giddy
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:37.440]   when they find young talent.
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.720]   How inspiring it is, how exciting it is.
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:40.840]   Like when you talk to these kids
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:42.360]   who are doing things on the internet
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.920]   or writing or whatever achievement,
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.400]   you want them to flourish.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:47.080]   You're not threatened by them
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.320]   as the antagonists of the Fountainhead are.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.640]   And that doesn't come through in the Fountainhead
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:52.480]   because of-- - But it depends
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.400]   on your profession, right?
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:54.720]   I mean, for some of these-- - Sure.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:56.560]   - Parts of the world are better than others.
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:00.800]   If you're an artist, at least the way I conceive of art,
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.560]   and you wanna go study art today,
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.800]   you're gonna be pooh-poohed
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:05.880]   and look down on-- - Oh, of course.
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:06.720]   - And so on.
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:07.560]   So yeah, I agree.
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:10.760]   I mean, in my generation, when I read "Ein Renn,"
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:13.360]   there was no internet, and I was in Israel,
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:16.280]   so we were isolated, and there was nobody else
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.480]   who had shared their ideas.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:19.840]   And you did feel that kind of isolation,
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:23.800]   but Rourke gave you, to me, he didn't teach me about,
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.160]   you know, you're gonna be isolated,
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:28.160]   'cause partially it's 'cause I wasn't,
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.800]   maybe I was humble, right?
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.360]   (Rourke laughs)
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.200]   - You thought you were Israeli.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.040]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:38.000]   When I read "Atlas Shrugged,"
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.960]   I identified with Eddie Willis.
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.080]   - Okay. - When I read
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.960]   "The Fountainhead," I didn't identify with Howard Rourke.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.160]   - How old were you when you read "The Fountainhead"?
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.560]   - So I read "Atlas" when I was 16.
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:50.720]   I probably read "Fountainhead" when I was 16 1/2, 17,
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:51.560]   something like that.
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:52.400]   - That is an unfair war crime.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.040]   - And I read-- - You read "The Fountainhead"
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:55.240]   after "Atlas Shrugged"? - Yeah.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.680]   - If anyone listening to this--
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:57.520]   - They should read "Fountainhead" first.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:00.320]   - If you read "Fountainhead" after "Atlas Shrugged,"
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.400]   that is a war crime. - No, for me--
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:03.760]   - I swear to God. - For me, reading
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.360]   "Atlas Shrugged" was much more important.
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:07.480]   - It is more important, but my point is,
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:10.280]   I think "The Fountainhead" in many ways is redundant
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.720]   in certain aspects if you read "Atlas Shrugged" first.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:14.960]   And because "The Fountainhead" is such a masterful book
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:18.040]   and such a personal book-- - I agree with that.
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:19.600]   So ideally, you would read "The Fountainhead" first.
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.880]   - That's all I'm saying, yes.
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:21.920]   - But-- - And here's the other thing
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:23.800]   people don't appreciate, I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:25.160]   People think Rand's always about politics,
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.200]   politics, politics, politics.
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:28.520]   "Fountainhead" is not a political book.
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:29.680]   - At all. - It's about,
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:31.960]   well, she talks about it as "Politics of Man's Soul," sure.
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:35.000]   But it's about ethics, how important everyone has to have
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.020]   a moral code.
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:38.360]   That's the other thing why people find Rand off-putting.
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:42.220]   If you have young people who now find it very important
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:44.560]   to live a moral life, who are like,
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:48.000]   "What does that mean to have morality, to have ethics,
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.680]   "to live with integrity?"
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:52.640]   For people who have gotten a little older,
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:54.840]   who have made these little sacrifices,
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:56.660]   who are like, "I'm not gonna fight at work.
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:58.720]   "Do I really need to look for another job?
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:00.900]   "Yeah, my wife's kind of getting annoying,
[01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:02.720]   "but am I gonna make a fight about it?"
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:05.720]   These little sacrifices that they make every day--
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:07.940]   - And big ones. - And big ones, absolutely.
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:10.680]   So when you have someone who's saying,
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:13.940]   forcing you to look in the mirror and say,
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:16.740]   "Those little sacrifices and big sacrifices you made,
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:19.660]   "you did the wrong thing, and you're evading
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:21.800]   "that you betrayed your own conscience,"
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:24.480]   that, to many people, I think, is very threatening.
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:27.440]   - But this is why so many people say
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:29.680]   that Ayn Rand is for 14-year-old boys.
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.280]   - Yeah, right. - Right?
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:34.080]   - You're brought up. - And there's a reason why
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:37.600]   it appeals to 14, is a little young, but 16, 18,
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.080]   it's because those are the ages
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:40.920]   where we're still open to idealism,
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:43.160]   idealism in a positive sense, right?
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:47.400]   To beautiful things, to ideals, to seeking perfection,
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.280]   to seeking a great life.
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:53.060]   I think as you grow older, most people become cynical.
[01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:54.360]   They give up on their ideals, why?
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:57.040]   Because their ideals were wrong, and their ideals failed.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.520]   Right, my parents were socialists when they were young.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.800]   Those ideas failed, so where do you go from socialism
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:02.960]   if your ideals fail? - Cynicism, yes.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:04.200]   - To cynicism. - Which is horrible.
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:07.680]   - Right, all adults, almost all adults out there are cynical,
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.560]   and that has failed, the idealism,
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:11.660]   and when they look at the young people,
[01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:14.520]   they see their idealism, oh, well, that's,
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:17.600]   I was idealistic, too, and they don't question the idea,
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:19.200]   well, they're good ideals and they're bad ideals,
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.240]   they're right ideals and they're wrong ideals,
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:24.760]   and that's why they attribute it to youth.
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:26.960]   So it's a threat to a lot of people,
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.960]   a lot of people who it's too late for.
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:31.120]   For some people, it's too late to change their minds,
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:35.120]   and they know it, and they're too invested
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:38.880]   in the job, in the wife, in the compromises.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.320]   - In the comfort.
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:42.840]   - And they're too invested in the comfort,
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:45.320]   too invested in compromise, too invested in comfort,
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:47.480]   and they know that they shouldn't be,
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:49.040]   they know they should change,
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:51.040]   and these young people are challenging that,
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:53.620]   and that is really, really scary for them,
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:55.480]   and that's why they reject it
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:57.720]   without too much consideration.
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:59.560]   - One of the things Rand, the working title
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:01.400]   for Fountainhead was Secondhand Lives,
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:04.360]   and Rand had two definitions of selfishness in that book.
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.440]   One is selfishness in the sense of,
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.220]   my life is the most important thing,
[01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:09.760]   it's not the only important thing,
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.560]   my family would be number two, friends,
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:13.440]   they certainly are extremely high values,
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.600]   but you can't have these secondary values
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.440]   without the first value.
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:17.720]   - But in the context of my life, right,
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:20.040]   'cause your family might not be a value, right?
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:20.880]   You might hate your parents.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:23.320]   - Sure, the point being, selfishness.
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.400]   Then there's the other kind of selfishness,
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:27.480]   which is Peter Keating, one of the villains of the book,
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:30.320]   which is he's selfish in that he's greedy,
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:31.760]   he's looking out for number one,
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:34.320]   but he has no values, he has no sense of character,
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:36.600]   he just wants to be wealthy,
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:38.360]   he wants to have a beautiful wife,
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:40.080]   he wants to have a big house, why?
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:42.040]   He couldn't tell you, because other people have it,
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.280]   and he wants to have it more than them.
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.880]   His sense of reference is other people,
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:47.600]   he's living secondhand.
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:51.160]   The problem with that is, a lot of young people read Rand,
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:53.080]   and when they start arguing online,
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:55.160]   they just start trying to talk like Rand,
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:58.000]   whereas Rand would be like, be original, be an innovator.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.800]   If you want to argue for objectivism in Rand's views,
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:03.480]   take her ideas, articulate them in your own way,
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:05.040]   'cause that's a good way of showing
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:06.840]   that you understand what she thinks,
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:09.640]   but what they end up doing is just talking like her,
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:11.800]   it sounds dated and comical,
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:12.960]   and that's going to be off-putting,
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:15.200]   'cause it's like, Rand wouldn't expect someone else
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:18.400]   to sound like Rand, she's her own person.
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:20.720]   - And she, of course, wouldn't view Keating as selfish
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:23.560]   in any sense, because, or even greedy,
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.000]   greed is a tricky word, but--
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.320]   - He was selfish in the old school sense.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:28.640]   - Yeah, he's selfish in the old,
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:33.400]   but even there, it's not as if he has some passion
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:34.960]   and he's going after that passion no matter what,
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:37.800]   I'm getting light sheets, steel, I'm getting,
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:40.640]   he doesn't have, his passion is painting, right?
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:42.280]   And he doesn't pursue his passion,
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:44.440]   he pursues what his mother wants him to pursue.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.480]   And he pursues money and--
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:47.320]   - Status, he's a statistician.
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.560]   - He's completely second-handed in the sense
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.600]   that he follows other people's values, not his own.
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.560]   - Can we actually just backtrack,
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:55.160]   and can we define some of these ideas
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:58.000]   that Ayn Rand is known for of selfishness?
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.360]   Selfishness, egoism, egotism, greed,
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:04.240]   I mean, those, basically all of those words
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.280]   are seen as negative in society,
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:10.480]   and Ayn Rand has been reclaiming in her work those words.
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:13.240]   So, can you speak to what they mean?
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:16.320]   - I think she's trying to, and Yaron might disagree,
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:19.920]   I think she's trying to be needlessly provocative,
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:23.320]   and it's off-putting, and on one hand,
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.840]   maybe you wanna be a provocateur,
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.320]   'cause that gives you people like,
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.440]   what does this woman mean?
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:29.200]   On the other hand, many people
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:30.760]   are gonna be viscerally put off.
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:33.440]   When Ayn Rand was on Donahue in 1979,
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.440]   he asked her explicitly,
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.880]   "Define to me the virtue of selfishness,"
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:40.560]   which is the title of her collection of essays as well.
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:42.720]   And she, this is Rand, immediately says,
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:45.160]   "Use a different word, self-esteem."
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:46.480]   And it's like, yeah, it's like,
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:49.040]   why are you championing this word
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:51.520]   which has extremely negative connotations?
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.920]   Whereas if you just say,
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:54.960]   and this is thanks to her and her work,
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:59.560]   "My life matters, my values matter,
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.720]   "I'm not gonna apologize for that,"
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:04.400]   that is a lot less off-putting
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:06.960]   than this caricature of Rand, which is,
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:08.560]   when people hear "I'm for selfishness,"
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:10.800]   they hear, "Oh, someone's bleeding out in the corner,
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:12.480]   "but I wanna get a Coke, that's nice."
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:13.640]   She condemned that.
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:15.740]   She says, "I'm against this kind of sociopathy,
[01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:17.100]   "that's absolutely crazy."
[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:18.440]   But that word selfishness--
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:21.900]   - It goes a mistake to be provocative
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:24.780]   in this one dimension, to go and to stick with it.
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:26.120]   I mean, she's stuck with this idea
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:27.140]   of selfishness and so on.
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:31.820]   - This term, and I often use terms for provocative effect.
[01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:32.660]   - Yes, this is true.
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:36.060]   You're a master, you're a scholar of the trolling arts.
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:37.220]   - Thank you, sir.
[01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:39.660]   But I think this is one example
[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:42.180]   where the costs outweigh the benefits.
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:43.380]   And go ahead, your honor.
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:46.160]   - Yes, I'm open to that idea,
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:47.900]   but I don't think that's right.
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:52.900]   When you actually dig deeper into what people object to,
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:55.860]   they're not objecting to the word,
[01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:57.460]   they're objecting to the ideas.
[01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:01.520]   And she addresses this explicitly
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.420]   in "The Virtue of Selfishness,"
[01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:03.420]   in I think the introduction.
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:05.580]   - Wait, hold on, I gotta ask for clarification.
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:07.520]   You're saying they're objecting to the ideas,
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:08.740]   but when they talk about her,
[01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:09.900]   they're not talking about her actual ideas,
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:11.400]   they're talking about the caricature.
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:14.540]   - Well, sure, but the caricature is a defense mechanism,
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:17.140]   not to have to deal with the ideas.
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:19.360]   Right, so they create the caricature
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.280]   in order to ignore the ideas,
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:23.600]   in order to, and some of them do it consciously.
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:26.740]   Like when people like Krugman and others do this,
[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:28.220]   they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:30.800]   - Well, Krugman's an, is Ellsworth Tewi.
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:33.360]   - Yes, he's the perfect Ellsworth Tewi.
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:36.760]   And he knows Ayn Rand, he's read Ayn Rand,
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.840]   and he knows she's the enemy in some sense.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:39.680]   He knows--
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:42.500]   - Check out our episode with Krugman.
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:43.920]   I think it's number 90.
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:45.160]   - Yeah, it was a great conversation.
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:46.960]   - Didn't get as many views as me, but what are you gonna do?
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:49.560]   - Well, you got a Nobel Prize, so what you got?
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:52.880]   - I got a ticket to heaven.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:53.800]   Sorry, Paul.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:55.800]   - Yasser Alphard has a Nobel Prize.
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:59.240]   - And Hitler was Times Man of the Year for a few times.
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:02.480]   - But you, that really bothers me when people bring that up.
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:03.320]   Are you really--
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:04.160]   - Yeah, Time of the Year, Man of the Year--
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:06.000]   - It's called a joke, Michael.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.440]   - Is it?
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:09.080]   - Man of the Year is not representative of good,
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:11.480]   it represents the most influential person of that year,
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:12.320]   and Hitler was.
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:13.160]   - Absolutely.
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.800]   - So what were you upset about?
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:16.680]   - When people like, well, look at Time Magazine,
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:18.760]   they call Hitler Man of the Year, like you're on set.
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:19.760]   They won't say this guy's awesome,
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.320]   they say this is the guy who moved on the world the most.
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:23.120]   - They know it's sanctioned him, that's it.
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:23.960]   - It's not like he was Stalin.
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:26.400]   - I don't go out there.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.280]   - Now that's who they like.
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.120]   Hitler's terrible.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:29.960]   - Oh no.
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:31.400]   - The Stalin guy.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:32.800]   Oh no, no, I'm not even joking.
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:36.760]   - The attitude of people between Nazism,
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:39.880]   or fascism, and communism is stunning.
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:41.960]   - In my upcoming book, I have all the receipts,
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:44.240]   how the things that they were saying about Stalin
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.280]   at the time are, if you look back, it's unconscionable,
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:50.480]   and these people have had no accountability
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:51.320]   for what they did.
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:52.800]   - But it's not even at the time,
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.360]   and we need to get back to the selfishness stuff,
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:56.600]   but it's not even at the time.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:59.920]   So I was once, I think I've told this story,
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:03.960]   I was in the green room going on John Stossel's show,
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:06.360]   and I saw a bunch of libertarians, right,
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:07.720]   in the green room, all hanging out,
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:10.040]   and this guy walks in, this young guy walks in,
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:13.440]   and somebody says to me, he's a communist.
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:14.680]   I said, what do you mean?
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:18.120]   Said, they said, no, no, he's a card-carrying,
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:20.920]   real member of the Communist Party, he's a communist.
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:23.720]   And I said, and that's okay with you guys?
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:26.560]   And they go, yeah, yeah, nice guy.
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:28.880]   And I'm like, no, this is not acceptable.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:30.520]   - Hold on, let me quote Rand.
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:34.320]   Rand said she would rather talk to a philosophical Marxist,
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.400]   right, did she not say this?
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:38.120]   - Yeah, but this is a communist,
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:40.680]   in the context of 21st century, right?
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:43.200]   So I said-- - But not 20th.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:46.080]   - Well, in a sense that we know exactly what.
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:46.920]   - Sure, sure. - We know exactly.
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.200]   - Oh yeah, yeah, that's-- - So I'm like,
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:50.680]   this guy has the blood of 100 million people on his hands.
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:52.380]   I'm not letting him off the hook.
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:55.600]   So I engage with this guy, and literally,
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:59.920]   we get into this, I'm telling him what I think of his ideas,
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:01.760]   and therefore what I think of him.
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:04.280]   Then the people from the wardrobe department come out,
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:05.480]   and their chairs are put aside,
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:07.480]   and this little gladiator ring.
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:10.200]   It's like the libertarians are sitting there amused,
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:11.360]   'cause to them it's just,
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.800]   you know, and I'm not gonna name names,
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:16.240]   but to them it's just like, yeah, he's a communist.
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:17.080]   - No pun intended, I'm gonna name names.
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:20.240]   - And I said at some point to them,
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.640]   I won't name names, because,
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:23.840]   I said at some point to them,
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:26.400]   if somebody walks into a room and says, I'm a Nazi,
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:28.680]   do you just treat him as, okay,
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.600]   let's go hang out and get some drinks?
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:31.480]   - I do. - I don't.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:32.840]   - I do, 'cause I wrote a book about this,
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.480]   the new right, and I did talk to Nazis,
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:35.320]   and I went to North Korea--
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:36.480]   - Yeah, 'cause you were writing a book.
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:38.120]   - Yeah. - Right, but you're not,
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:40.680]   you're not gonna hang out with a Nazi or a communist
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:42.120]   just like the regular person, right?
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:43.800]   To me, a Nazi and a communist are the same.
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:46.000]   - I don't, okay, please explain this,
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.920]   'cause first of all, any time you have equivocation,
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:49.960]   I hate that, because I don't like equality,
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.440]   I think it's a bad concept.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:53.480]   We're all sitting here as Jewish people, right?
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:56.160]   We're from the Soviet Union.
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:58.640]   To say these two things are basically the same,
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:00.080]   it's a matter of life and death for all of us.
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:01.720]   We'd be dead under Hitler.
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:04.840]   We're not doing so hot under Stalin, but we're still alive.
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:05.680]   - Sure.
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:07.040]   - So there's some very big difference.
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:07.880]   - Sure.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:08.720]   - And one more thing.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:09.560]   - So within the context--
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:10.400]   - Just hold on, one more thing.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:11.800]   There's also one very big difference
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:14.880]   in that one has a lot worse of a brand name,
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:17.200]   and the other does not, even though the other should.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:18.040]   - It's a brand.
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:18.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:19.800]   - Yeah, so I agree.
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:21.760]   So there's a context in which I would fear
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:22.960]   Stalin more than Hitler.
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:25.480]   There's a different context in which I would fear Hitler.
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:30.320]   But as ideologies, they are equally evil.
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:31.360]   - Wait, wait, but--
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:33.280]   - Not the same, because the difference
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:35.000]   is between communism and fascism,
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.920]   but as ideologies, they're equally evil.
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:39.960]   They both view the individual as insignificant, unimportant,
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:41.600]   and they both basically wanna kill
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:42.720]   any independent-minded--
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:45.040]   - But you're equating communism with Stalinism.
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:45.880]   So you're--
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.000]   - No, I'm equating communism.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.280]   I don't know what Stalinism is.
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:50.640]   I don't care.
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:52.160]   Stalinism is one version of communism.
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:53.320]   - It's an implementation.
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:56.760]   - Communism is an evil ideology, no matter who practices it.
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:01.280]   - I don't think that's, I think that's too loose,
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.640]   because here's one example.
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:07.640]   The first person who went to the Soviet Union from the left
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.880]   and denounced it was Emma Goldman.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:11.840]   She was an anarcho-communist, right?
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:14.360]   So she went there, she got deported from the United States.
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:16.440]   She went to Lenin, to his face.
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:17.280]   Hold on, let me finish.
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:19.320]   You're already dismissing what I'm saying.
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:20.160]   - Me?
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:21.680]   - Your body language, your emotions.
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:25.840]   Listen, history doesn't care about your feelings either.
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.440]   She goes to Lenin, she goes,
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:29.560]   "We're supposed to be about free speech.
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.280]   "We're supposed to be about the individual freedom.
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:32.120]   "What are you doing?"
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:34.400]   She goes, "Free speech is a bourgeois extravagance.
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.960]   "You can't have it during a revolution, too bad."
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:39.040]   She comes back to the West.
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:39.880]   Wait, he's right?
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:40.720]   - Yeah.
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:41.560]   - Oh no, yeah, correct, yeah, I just said, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:42.400]   - He's more consistent.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.360]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's more consistent.
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:44.200]   - She's a compromise.
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:45.600]   - Yeah, you're right.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:48.320]   She comes back to the West, the big red Emma,
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:51.160]   the big hero of the left, and she goes,
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:54.320]   "You guys, this is a complete,"
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:55.960]   she didn't say bad, she was very randy.
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:57.640]   She goes, "This is pure evil.
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:58.800]   "This is horrifying.
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:00.080]   "What they're doing to the workers,
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.800]   "which you supposedly care about, completely oppressing."
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:05.000]   And when one person described it, they go,
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.880]   "When she got up to talk, it was a standing ovation.
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:09.960]   "And when she was finished, you could hear a pin drop."
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:12.760]   Because she wasn't some capitalist.
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:15.600]   She wasn't some bourgeois conservative.
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:19.280]   She was as hard left for violent revolution as it gets.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:23.000]   And so I don't think she, as a communist, is an evil person.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:23.880]   - I think she is.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:28.880]   Because if she wasn't evading, and with Rand,
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:33.000]   and I think in reality, the essence of evil is evasion,
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.040]   is ignoring the facts of reality,
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:37.560]   is putting your feelings ahead of your facts.
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:40.960]   She would realize that what was going on in the Soviet Union
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:43.200]   was the inevitable consequence of her ideas.
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:44.600]   - That could be just as dumb.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:46.320]   - So she could have changed her mind.
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:48.080]   She could have, coming back to the Soviet Union,
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:50.200]   said, "These ideas are wrong.
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:52.120]   "I now repudiate my ideas,
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:54.720]   "not just their implementation, but my ideas."
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:55.840]   And then I would have said,
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.360]   "Yeah, she'd been mistaken before,
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.920]   "and now she's confronted reality."
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:00.640]   But if she stayed a leftist,
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.560]   if she stayed a leftist to that extent,
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.680]   not just a mild leftist, but a leftist,
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:07.800]   then I think she's dishonest, and therefore immoral.
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:09.240]   - But you're using three words identically.
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:11.200]   You're saying dishonest, immoral, and evil.
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:16.200]   - Okay, so evil is an extreme form of your morality.
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:18.520]   So okay, so she's immoral.
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:20.120]   The ideology she holds is still evil,
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:21.440]   'cause the ideology. - Maybe she's delusional.
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:22.640]   - She might be delusional.
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:23.480]   - But delusional and evil aren't the same.
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:24.840]   - But she can be delusional.
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:26.720]   She cannot be delusional.
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:29.720]   See, I'm willing to accept a delusion
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:32.160]   before she's gone to the Soviet Union and seen it.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:33.680]   Once she's gone to see it,
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:36.920]   I don't think that excuse holds anymore.
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:39.120]   I think now she's being confronted,
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:42.000]   and she's lying to herself about the implications of it.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.280]   Logically, it's inevitable that what happens
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:49.040]   in the Soviet Union has to happen in any communist context.
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:51.640]   - So to play a little bit of a devil's advocate here,
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:54.360]   is it logically inevitable?
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:56.880]   Can you imagine that there is communist systems
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:59.480]   where the consequences we've seen in the 20th century
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:02.120]   are not the consequences we get?
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:05.560]   Imagine future societies under different conditions,
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:07.520]   under different, with the internet,
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:09.200]   different communication schemes,
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:11.120]   different set of resources. - As long as human beings
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:11.960]   are what we are.
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:14.680]   Now, the Borg, you remember the Borg from "Star Trek"
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.680]   or whatever the series was? - Okay, nerd.
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:17.800]   (both laughing)
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:19.880]   - Yeah, I mean, no.
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:23.520]   I'm a nerd, okay.
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:24.680]   - The Borg. - It's the highest
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:25.920]   of compliments. - The Borg.
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:27.240]   - In this household. - The Borg
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:29.560]   is the highest of lex. (both laughing)
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:32.160]   - The Borg is communist, right?
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:34.320]   The Borg is a different species.
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.000]   It has a different biology.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.840]   It has a business, different form of consciousness.
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:42.380]   Now, whether such a being could survive evolution
[01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:43.220]   is a question.
[01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:44.240]   Whether such a-- - Well, ants,
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:45.080]   they don't have to be intelligent.
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:46.260]   - Yeah, but then the question is,
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:50.240]   can you have free will, human cognitive cognition,
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:51.200]   and be a Borg?
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:52.040]   I don't think so.
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:54.320]   But maybe, maybe in another planet.
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:55.440]   But human beings-- - You gotta take DMT
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:57.840]   to meet the Borg. (both laughing)
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:00.440]   - So human beings, no.
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:03.520]   Communism is anti, the reason communism's evil
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:06.120]   is it's anti-reality, anti-human nature,
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:10.140]   anti the individual, and therefore it is inherently evil.
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:13.200]   It cannot result in anything good coming out of it.
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:14.040]   Only bad can come of it.
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:15.840]   - Do you think you could have predicted that
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:18.320]   before the 20th century? - Yes, and plenty of people did.
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:19.960]   It's not-- - You know who did?
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:21.200]   Mikhail Bakunin.
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:23.120]   Mikhail Bakunin, who was an early communist,
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:26.920]   Marx's rival, in 18, this is gonna be in my upcoming book,
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:30.080]   in 1860, he sat down and wrote an essay,
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:33.080]   goes, "What Marx is advocating is insane.
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:35.020]   "This is gonna be worse than the czar.
[01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:37.980]   "You're talking about complete totalitarian nightmare.
[01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:39.420]   "When you put this into practice,
[01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:41.520]   "it's gonna be something we've never seen before.
[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:42.600]   "It's a pure horror."
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:43.920]   But he was a hardcore leftist.
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:45.320]   - Look, Marx predicted it, right?
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:46.880]   We talked about this-- - Yeah, that's true.
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:49.120]   - Marx, at some point, says certain people
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:50.600]   cannot be part of the politic,
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:51.880]   and they have to be liquidated.
[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:54.600]   So this idea of mass murder and mass killing,
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.020]   it's not new to communism,
[01:45:56.020 --> 01:45:58.340]   it is an inherent part of what it means.
[01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:00.480]   You're either proletarian or you're not.
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:04.240]   And you look, and in Marx, it's in Marx, right?
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.280]   The individual doesn't matter.
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:08.080]   Now, he might matter in his utopia,
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:10.000]   'cause he knows he's got a marketing problem.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.560]   See, Marx has a marketing problem,
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:13.520]   because the fact is you have individuals.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:14.600]   How do you convince individuals
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:15.840]   to give up their individualism,
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.640]   to give up the individuality?
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:19.440]   What you say is, well, we have to go
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:22.640]   through this difficult process to get to this utopia.
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:26.040]   And in this utopia, I mean, he's very Christian.
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:27.360]   I mean, this is the other thing about Marx.
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:28.200]   - About the end times, yeah, yeah.
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:29.920]   - Marx is very Christian in everything,
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:32.000]   in his morality, in his collectivism,
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:32.840]   and in the end times.
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:36.440]   The end times for Marx is going back to the Garden of Eden.
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:40.520]   The end time for Marx is you don't have to do anything.
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:42.760]   Food is just available.
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:44.400]   Wealth is just available.
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:47.000]   You can do your hobbies, you can do everything.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.160]   You can do whatever you want,
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:49.480]   whatever feelings, whatever.
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:51.200]   So it's going back to Garden of Eden
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:53.360]   perception, perspective on human.
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:55.560]   So he knows what that is gonna require.
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:56.880]   It's gonna require this dictatorship,
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:58.400]   the proletarian, to get there.
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:00.200]   And he never tells you how we get there, right?
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:01.920]   There's no game plan.
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:02.760]   - Where there's a rule, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:04.880]   - There's a dictatorship, then there's utopia.
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:06.520]   - It's like the underpants notes.
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:07.520]   Step one, dictatorship.
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:08.440]   Step two, question marks.
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:09.280]   Step three, utopia, yeah.
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:11.560]   - And the question mark is where the action is, right?
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:12.400]   Annihilate.
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.880]   - Yeah, you yada yada the important part.
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:17.440]   - And people buy this garbage, right?
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:20.800]   So there's nothing of value in Marx.
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:21.960]   I mean, let me be very clear.
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:24.520]   There's nothing, he gets capitalism wrong.
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:26.600]   He gets the proletarian wrong.
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:27.800]   He gets the workers wrong.
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:31.960]   He gets the labor theory of value is wrong.
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:33.240]   There is nothing of value.
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:35.140]   There's nothing of value in communism.
[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:39.440]   It is a wrong, unfitted to human nature ideology
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:41.200]   from beginning to end.
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:44.360]   - The clarity with which you speak is just not something I,
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:46.200]   I don't think I have that clarity about anything.
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:48.400]   So I, I mean, it has to do with that thing
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:50.240]   that where everybody has something to teach you.
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:52.680]   I just feel like I've been reading "Mein Kampf" recently,
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:54.320]   for example, for the first time.
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.720]   - Something to learn from Hitler?
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:57.640]   - Well, there's a lot to learn from Hitler.
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:00.080]   - About the nature of evil, about wrong ideas,
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:02.640]   not about anything good, not about anything positive.
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:04.440]   - So yeah, so that's probably a really bad example.
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:07.120]   - But why is Hitler different than Marx?
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:08.400]   - Well, that's a very good question.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:10.320]   - No, I get that, but in terms of ideas,
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:11.560]   why is Hitler different than Marx?
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:15.600]   Why do we have to assume there's something to learn from Marx
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.640]   but there's nothing, but we acknowledge
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:19.280]   that there's nothing positive to learn from him?
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:20.720]   - Because, I mean, all right.
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:22.440]   - I can tell you something in the sense that like,
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:23.880]   there's an interesting question is,
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:26.920]   how did this person get from step A
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:28.280]   to being able to implement the ideas?
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:29.800]   - I know you, everybody should read,
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:31.960]   anybody who's interested should read Marx
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:33.440]   because it's really important.
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:34.520]   It's important in the history
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:36.440]   and a lot of people were influenced by it.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:37.560]   Why was it influential?
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:40.400]   What is it that he says that appeals to people?
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:42.240]   I find it interesting to see all the parallels
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:43.840]   with Christianity and I think that's why,
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:45.280]   to a large extent, it appeals to people
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:46.920]   because they got to give up
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.280]   the unimportant part of religion
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:50.920]   and got to keep the fun parts of religion,
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:52.440]   the important parts to them of religion,
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:54.240]   the morality, for example.
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:57.640]   But no, there's not something positive
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:48:58.680]   to learn from everybody.
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:01.720]   - In Ayn Rand's view, in your view,
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:03.520]   who was worse, Stalin or Hitler?
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:08.960]   - I think worse is, this is something that I,
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:12.560]   I'll do a Randian sin and be evasive.
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:16.440]   It really drives me crazy when people sit down
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:18.880]   and have these competitions about like,
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:20.880]   if someone who's Jewish brings up the Holocaust
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:23.000]   and someone who's African-American brings up slavery
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.320]   and this is a conversation that I think is pointless
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:28.280]   and very hurtful and harmful
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:31.240]   and it is really like silly and ridiculous.
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:33.720]   So it might make sense in like some kind of stoner context
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:36.320]   about like you're doing the math and trying to figure out,
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.280]   but it's like, and yeah, you could be like,
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:40.520]   what would you rather have like this kind of cancer
[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:41.400]   or full-blown AIDS?
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:44.520]   In short, I mean, there's gotta be life expectancy,
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:49.360]   but these are such, I'll evade your question, reframe it.
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:52.400]   I think we understand,
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:54.520]   and a lot of this is a function of the propaganda
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:56.160]   at the time, and I'm not using the word propaganda
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:00.240]   in a negative sense, the horrors of Hitler and Nazism.
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:02.760]   I think, and one of the things I'm trying to solve
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:07.000]   with my upcoming book, there is a very poor understanding
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.840]   about the horrors of Stalinism
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:11.680]   and what that meant in practice.
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:13.160]   One of the reasons I wrote "Dear Reader,"
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:17.760]   my North Korea book, and what I was shocked and delighted by
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:19.680]   when I started writing "Dear Reader,"
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:21.520]   I thought to myself, look,
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:24.300]   I have very little capacity to affect change,
[01:50:24.300 --> 01:50:27.320]   but I can tell stories, I can write books.
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:29.400]   This is my competency.
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:33.040]   If I move the needle in America, we got it pretty good here.
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:34.880]   If I move the needle in North Korea,
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:37.560]   this could have really profound positive consequences.
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.160]   And so I set a very limited goal,
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:41.720]   and that goal is to change the conversation
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:44.440]   about North Korea, to stop it being regarded
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:47.480]   as a laughingstock, and start regarding it
[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:50.920]   as a existential horror.
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:52.480]   And the metaphor I use always,
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:54.420]   and we brought up earlier, was the Joker,
[01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:57.280]   'cause people look at Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il, his father,
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:50:59.080]   they look at a clown, this guy's a buffoon,
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:02.080]   and that's valid, and I go, and I said,
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:04.800]   this is what I can do, I can move that camera a little bit.
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:07.320]   And now that camera, instead of looking at Kim Jong-un,
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:09.320]   Kim Jong-il, you see behind him,
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:11.880]   literally millions of corpses.
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:14.180]   And when you see people putting on these performances
[01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:16.360]   in these shows, look at these fools,
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:18.320]   then you're like, everyone, those people,
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.760]   their kid has a gun to their head right now.
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:22.200]   If someone puts a gun to your kid's head,
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:23.360]   you're gonna put on clown makeup?
[01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:24.240]   Yeah, you are.
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:25.320]   What color?
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:27.440]   Put on the shoes, whatever you want.
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:32.040]   So in terms of, people do not appreciate
[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:34.720]   the horrors of Stalinism.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:37.360]   I think this is a big fault of the right wing.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:39.240]   You can't expect necessarily the New York Times
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:41.520]   to do this because of the blood on their hands.
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:44.800]   And for a long time, I was berating conservatives.
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:47.280]   I go, this was the big right wing victory,
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:49.840]   bloodless largely, the victory of the Soviet Union.
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:52.020]   No one's talking about it, no one's informing.
[01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:54.920]   And let's be clear, there are very many people
[01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:56.600]   who are Democrats, who are on the left,
[01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:58.880]   who are violently opposed, literally violently opposed
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:00.600]   to the Soviet Union and its horrors.
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:03.640]   This is not necessarily a partisan issue.
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:05.640]   And I'm like, all right, I'm gonna do something about it.
[01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:08.320]   So I know that's not really literally your question,
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:11.120]   but that's kind of information that features.
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:13.480]   - Let me ask you that question if it's okay.
[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:18.200]   So which can we learn more from,
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:21.240]   from a historical perspective looking forward?
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:25.840]   Like which has more lessons in how to avoid it,
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:29.200]   how to, and just general lessons about human nature?
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:30.680]   - Well, I mean, I agree with Michael
[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:34.240]   that it's not important who's more evil,
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:37.600]   'cause they're both evil and they're both just so evil
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:39.720]   that the differences don't matter.
[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:44.360]   What matters is what is the ideology?
[01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:47.480]   What are the consequences?
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:49.040]   What do we understand from it?
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:50.800]   What are we worried about?
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:52.440]   What are we gonna avoid?
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:56.240]   So I'm not worried about Nazism, Qua Nazism,
[01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:57.480]   because everybody hates Nazism.
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:53:01.080]   I mean, it's uniform that that's out.
[01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:04.480]   Even the people I think on the far right in America
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:06.960]   are staying away from the cliches of Nazism,
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:08.480]   although some of them are stupid enough not to.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:11.440]   But in the end, if the United States
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:14.760]   goes authoritarian right, it's not gonna be Nazism.
[01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:17.000]   It'll be some other form of fascism,
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:21.960]   because that is so obviously being understood
[01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:25.440]   as evil and bad that there's almost no understanding
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:27.360]   that the evil of communism.
[01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:29.400]   I mean, you brought it up earlier, right?
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:32.600]   Almost nobody understands that communism
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:36.400]   is an evil ideology, that there's nothing worthwhile there,
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:39.720]   that any attempt to go in that direction
[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:42.640]   in any sustainable way is destructive.
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:44.320]   There are, as you mentioned,
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:46.520]   there are economists out there claiming they are communists.
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:48.640]   I mean, I find that despicable,
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:52.000]   that anybody would claim to be a communist economist
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.400]   or communist anything, because I think that's,
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:58.480]   it's a ideology that has no basis,
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:00.000]   but we haven't learned that.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:03.440]   So to me, communism is the much bigger threat,
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:07.840]   because we still think it's some kind of beautiful ideal
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:09.600]   in the world around us.
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:13.520]   I think Nazism's out, but I think fascism
[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:15.040]   is a massive threat out there,
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:17.560]   'cause I don't think we've learned real lessons of,
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:19.720]   nobody knows what Nazism, fascism is.
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:21.400]   Everybody thinks fascism is Nazism.
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:23.600]   They don't recognize that in a sense
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:24.960]   we are already fascist,
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:27.320]   and that we're certainly heading in that direction.
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:28.440]   So they don't know what it is,
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:29.520]   and again, we haven't studied,
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:32.400]   and the real lesson here is we haven't studied
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:34.880]   what unifies them both, 'cause there's not a big difference
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:37.120]   between fascism and communism.
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:39.120]   There's no big difference between Nazism and communism.
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:40.360]   - What does unify them?
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:45.320]   - What unifies them is the common good, the public interest.
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:47.240]   What unifies them is this idea
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:49.680]   that there is some elite group of people
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:52.400]   who can run our lives for us, for the common good,
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:54.360]   for the public interest.
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:55.800]   - And that you don't matter.
[01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:56.640]   That's the most important, yeah.
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:58.480]   - You as an individual, you individual don't matter,
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:01.520]   and they will dictate how you live.
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:03.360]   And so these are philosopher kings,
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:05.640]   it goes back to Plato's philosophy.
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:07.080]   But it really unifies it.
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:07.920]   Think about communism.
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:10.240]   Communism is about the sacrifice of the individual
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:11.600]   to the proletarian.
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:13.040]   Who is the proletarian?
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:15.440]   It's this collective group here.
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:17.360]   Who represents the proletarian?
[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:18.520]   Well, somebody has to.
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:20.560]   Somebody has to tell the proletarian what they believe in,
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:21.520]   'cause they don't know,
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:23.520]   'cause there is no collective consciousness.
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:24.800]   So you need a Stalin.
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:27.080]   And this is the point about Marxism.
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:29.360]   Marxism needs a dictator,
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:34.360]   because somebody has to represent the values,
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:37.600]   the public interest, what's good for the public.
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:39.080]   Nazism needs the same thing.
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:42.360]   Just Nazism replaced proletarian with Aryans,
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:44.560]   the Aryan race, and you have exactly the same thing.
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:46.400]   You need a dictator to tell us
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:47.600]   what's good for the Aryan people,
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:49.040]   so we can do what's good for the Aryan people.
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:51.600]   - So it's impossible to have a communist system
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:54.600]   or a fascist system without a dictator naturally emerging.
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:56.280]   It's not possible to have a Georgian.
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:57.680]   - It's not naturally, it's ideologically.
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:59.720]   - It's absolutely impossible to have that.
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:02.320]   On scale, you can certainly have communes,
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:04.400]   where people behave communistically.
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:06.640]   - Because it's not inside the ideology
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:07.480]   that that should happen. - Hold on, let me talk about this,
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:08.720]   because let's talk about fascism,
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:11.200]   'cause fascism, definitionally, is gonna have a strong man.
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:14.280]   I don't even know how it could be fascism without that.
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:16.280]   And let's talk, what you said earlier on
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:18.440]   is about how people don't know what fascism is.
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:20.200]   - Fascists don't know what fascism is.
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:22.720]   So there's a superb book by John Diggins
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:25.320]   from the early '70s called "Mussolini and Fascism,
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:26.520]   "The View from America."
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:29.400]   So I find Mussolini to be a far more interesting figure
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:32.400]   than Hitler, because he had a much more nuanced career.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:34.160]   He was much more of an innovator.
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:36.120]   - He was an intellectual, which is shocking,
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:38.160]   'cause he always comes across as a buffoon,
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:41.000]   but he was actually a thinker and a--
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.960]   - So why did he not resist Hitler at all?
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:43.800]   - Hold on, hold on.
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:47.200]   So one of the things with fascism is it comes,
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:50.920]   it's a direct line from Kant to Mussolini.
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:54.080]   So basically, there is a philosopher who I adore,
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:56.400]   who I'm sure you don't, called Schopenhauer.
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:59.120]   And Schopenhauer, the question became,
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:02.800]   Rand was not a particularly humorous person.
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:04.320]   She had some moments of wit.
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:07.320]   There's a great moment when she was on Tom Snyder's show
[01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:11.080]   in 1980, I believe, and she's talking about Kant.
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:13.680]   And she goes, "Immanuel Kant and all his
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:15.600]   "illegitimate children, if you catch my meaning,
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:17.320]   "she mean all his bastards."
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:19.440]   But the host, Tom Snyder, did not pick up on it.
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:21.440]   If you watch it on YouTube, you could pick up on it.
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:24.280]   And what happened was once Kant bifurcated reality
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:27.240]   into the phenomenal world, the pure idea world,
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:29.800]   and the numeral world, the question became,
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:33.520]   well, what is the nature of this world of ideas?
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:35.280]   And Hegel had it meant reason.
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:37.800]   I don't know even know what that means theoretically,
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:40.640]   that the world of reason is idea.
[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:42.760]   Schopenhauer, who hated Hegel,
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:44.680]   who constantly attacked him by name
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:46.560]   and Hegel's followers in his work,
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:50.480]   he was a very big innovator in a malevolent way
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:54.080]   'cause he said the nature of reality, this idea, is will,
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:57.080]   meaning the universe doesn't care about you
[01:57:57.080 --> 01:57:59.520]   and it's constantly in this reality
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:02.560]   putting urges in your mind, values.
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:04.720]   And when you denounce these values and urges,
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:06.400]   that's the basis of morality.
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:08.000]   And from there, it went to Nietzsche
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.500]   and the will isn't mindless, it is a will to power.
[01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:15.980]   Mussolini took this and basically said,
[01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:19.380]   because the will to power is the real reality,
[01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:23.220]   the Kantian idea, therefore all of this is secondary.
[01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:26.780]   So if we will it, we can make it happen.
[01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:30.860]   When you have this concept of my willpower
[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:32.620]   is stronger than reality and you're like,
[01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:34.860]   okay, how's this program gonna work?
[01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:36.260]   We can make it happen.
[01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:40.880]   That was why fascism is not a very coherent ideology
[01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:43.140]   because explicitly, there's a book called,
[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:45.020]   from 1936 called "The Philosophy of Fascism,"
[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:45.980]   which tried to codify this.
[01:58:45.980 --> 01:58:48.980]   '36, this is a long time ago, where they're like,
[01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:52.940]   we're against reason and explicitly rationality.
[01:58:52.940 --> 01:58:55.900]   We are for willpower, for strength.
[01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:58.960]   And if you are strong enough and united enough,
[01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:02.300]   you can force these things to work.
[01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:06.900]   So there's a lot that is not taught about this ideology.
[01:59:06.900 --> 01:59:10.100]   I highly recommend people read the books from the time.
[01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:12.380]   And what was fascinating about Mussolini
[01:59:12.380 --> 01:59:14.940]   is he was regarded as the moderate.
[01:59:14.940 --> 01:59:18.020]   Because the 1930s, you had the Great Depression,
[01:59:18.020 --> 01:59:19.300]   all the intellectuals said,
[01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:22.020]   this proves capitalism can't work.
[01:59:22.020 --> 01:59:24.100]   The Great Depression, obviously, air quotes,
[01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:25.480]   is capitalism's fault.
[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:27.740]   Then you have the alternative, the USSR.
[01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:29.220]   Well, that's not tenable for us.
[01:59:29.220 --> 01:59:30.740]   Here comes Mussolini.
[01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:32.060]   And Mussolini says,
[01:59:32.060 --> 01:59:34.060]   I'm gonna take the best of both worlds.
[01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:36.320]   I have aspects of markets, capitalism,
[01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:38.120]   but I don't have this chaos,
[01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:40.920]   but I also don't have complete government control
[01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:41.760]   of the bureaucrats.
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:43.800]   I'm gonna have this combination.
[01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:45.120]   And there was a Broadway song,
[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:47.240]   You're the Top, You're Mussolini,
[01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:48.560]   that was later edited out
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:50.600]   because that's when he took a bad turn.
[01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:54.240]   But this is kind of the fascist idea.
[01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:56.720]   - And it's about power and it's about control.
[01:59:56.720 --> 01:59:58.080]   That's the essence.
[01:59:58.080 --> 01:59:58.920]   It's about will.
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:01.240]   So they don't care.
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:03.960]   Fascists don't care who owns stuff, owns in quotes,
[02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:07.680]   because what's important is who controls it.
[02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:09.320]   So you can own your home,
[02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:11.400]   but if I get to tell you when you can sell it,
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:12.240]   for how much you can sell it,
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:14.120]   and what you can do on that home,
[02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:15.560]   then I'm in control of it.
[02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:17.120]   That's the essence of fascism.
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:18.820]   And if you think about it,
[02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:22.360]   we live today in a much more fascist economic context
[02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:23.400]   than anything else.
[02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:27.220]   We pretend that corporations are private,
[02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:29.280]   but when everything they do is regulated,
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:32.640]   who they can hire, how much they pay them,
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:34.760]   when and how they can fire them,
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:36.460]   what they can do on their property,
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:38.440]   it's all control.
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:43.240]   That's the way fascists start controlling everything.
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:45.320]   - But it's not possible to have checks on power
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:47.440]   and balance of power at the top of fascism
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:48.560]   or communist systems.
[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:51.760]   The question was whether in fascist systems
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:53.140]   or communist systems,
[02:00:53.140 --> 02:00:58.680]   we're saying the dictator naturally or must emerge.
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:00:59.760]   - I don't say emerge.
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:02.220]   The dictator's the one who makes the fascist system.
[02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:06.200]   - Yeah, fascism, well, it could emerge,
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:08.760]   because for example, I think today in America,
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:12.000]   we're moving much more towards fascism, socialism.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.320]   And at some point that'll manifest itself
[02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:15.680]   in some kind of dictator.
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:17.080]   And the dictator might be different
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:18.320]   than a Mussolini or Nazis.
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:22.680]   It might be couched in some kind of pseudo-constitutional
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:25.480]   American-- - It would be a lot easier
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:27.600]   for a female to be a fascist dictator in America
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:29.680]   than a male, because you have that softness.
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:31.420]   She's not gonna come off as a strong woman.
[02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:33.080]   People won't see it coming, in my opinion.
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:34.760]   - Maybe, I think it's gonna be,
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:36.280]   I have my own view.
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:39.120]   I think it's gonna be a nationalist,
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:40.520]   religionist, environmentalist.
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:42.040]   I think somebody who can combine those three--
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:43.000]   - Well, Hitler did those, yeah.
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:43.840]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:45.360]   And somebody who can combine those three
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:47.480]   and articulate the case for it, I think America's ready.
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:49.360]   - So you think it's possible for fascism
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:51.000]   to arise in the world again?
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.560]   - Oh, of course, it never went away.
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:54.720]   - It never went away. - They just adopt the name.
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:57.400]   - Because the fundamental ideas, the Kantian ideas,
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:01.000]   the ideas that are behind fascism never went away.
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.400]   They're still as popular, if anything, more popular
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:05.240]   than they were back then.
[02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:06.600]   Marx is as popular.
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:10.040]   I think these ideas are prevalent, they're out there,
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:13.760]   and absolutely, I think America's ready for them.
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:15.840]   Again, it won't be quite in the form
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:17.080]   that we've experienced in the past.
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:19.200]   It'll be in a uniquely American form,
[02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:21.200]   counts to the flag, and of course,
[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:22.840]   it was counts to the flag before.
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:26.240]   But no, yes, an authoritarian,
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:28.520]   some form of authoritarianism is necessary,
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:31.240]   'cause the fundamental principle behind
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:34.880]   both communism and fascism is the unimportance
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:35.800]   of the individual.
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:37.080]   The individual is nothing.
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:38.640]   The individual is a nobody,
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:41.160]   and the importance of the collective,
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:44.360]   the collective will, the collective soul,
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:46.000]   the collective consciousness.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.280]   But the collective has no will,
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:49.240]   has no soul, has no consciousness.
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:52.680]   So somebody has to emerge to speak for the collective.
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:55.560]   Otherwise, everything falls apart, right?
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:58.680]   So it's necessary, whether it's a committee
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:01.120]   or whether it's one person, how exactly,
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:03.760]   somebody has to speak for the collective.
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:06.640]   Even a committee doesn't function as a committee, right?
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:08.200]   Most committees, particularly when the committee
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:10.960]   is about dictating how people should live,
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:12.360]   somebody is going to,
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:14.000]   because now it becomes really, really important,
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.640]   somebody is gonna dominate that committee
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:17.760]   and rule over it, because you don't want
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:21.160]   independent voices, 'cause the individual doesn't matter.
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:22.000]   The individual doesn't count.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.280]   - And also, people are naturally hierarchical,
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:24.120]   so you have seven people,
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:25.760]   and they ostensibly have the same role.
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:27.920]   Someone is gonna emerge as a leader naturally,
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:28.760]   and some people are gonna be followers.
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:30.680]   - Yeah, it's the same reason you cannot have
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:33.360]   the Richard Wolff-type socialism of,
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:35.960]   and this is the more, if you will,
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:37.760]   innocent part of his ideas.
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:41.760]   Oh, why can't we have corporations all be worker-owned,
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:43.280]   and everybody votes on everything,
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:45.680]   and we vote on who should be CEO?
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:50.040]   No, communism, fascism, most ideas
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:54.040]   necessitate ultimately authoritarians,
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:55.840]   and that's most of human history.
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:03:57.160]   We forget again.
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:03:59.800]   This idea of liberty, this idea of freedom,
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:01.640]   even the limited freedom we have today--
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:02.760]   - It's a recent invention.
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:04.160]   - It's a recent invention.
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:07.040]   It happens in little pockets throughout history.
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:10.080]   We had a little bit of this democracy stuff, partial,
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:12.080]   only a few, some people got to vote,
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:13.520]   and it wasn't rights-respecting,
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:14.640]   because they didn't have the concept
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:16.000]   of rights in Athens, right?
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.200]   You had it in a few Greek cities.
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:19.240]   We maybe had a version of it in Venice.
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:22.160]   We had a version of it in city-states around the world.
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:24.320]   But then it was invented by the founding fathers
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:25.160]   in this country.
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:28.320]   That's what makes the founding of America so important
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:31.080]   and so different and such a radical thing
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:32.520]   to have happened historically.
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:33.800]   Freedom is rare.
[02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:35.280]   Authoritarianism is common.
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:37.120]   - So I was looking at some statistics
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:40.120]   that 53% of people in the world
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:42.400]   live under authoritarian governments.
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:43.400]   - Only 53.
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:46.040]   Oh, because India is democratic,
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:47.120]   so I guess they don't count India.
[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:50.680]   But yes, it used to be 100.
[02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:52.440]   - How do we change that? - Exactly, yeah.
[02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:53.280]   - How do we change that?
[02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:56.800]   - And even the authoritarianism in a country like China
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:01.160]   is a lot less than it used to be under Mao, right?
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:05.080]   So they were better off than they were under Mao.
[02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:06.040]   That's a reality.
[02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:07.720]   How do we change it?
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:10.160]   We have to declare,
[02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:12.200]   we have to change the ethical views of people.
[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:14.240]   This brings us back to selfishness.
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:18.120]   Because as long as the standard of morality
[02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:20.520]   is the group, others,
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:22.360]   as long as the standard of value
[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:24.360]   is what other people want, what other people think,
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:28.480]   as long as you are alive only to be sacrificed to the group,
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:31.680]   that's why you have to challenge Christianity,
[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:34.680]   as long as the Jesus on a cross
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:36.320]   dying for other people's sin
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:38.520]   is viewed as this noble, wonderful act
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:40.240]   instead of one of the most unjust things
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:42.120]   to ever happen to anybody,
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:44.600]   as long as the common good and the public interest
[02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:47.440]   are the standards by which we evaluate things,
[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:49.800]   we will always drift towards fascism,
[02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:51.960]   some form of authoritarianism.
[02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:53.600]   - Can I ask a question?
[02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:55.320]   I think there's something that has to go
[02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:56.720]   along with what Yaron was saying,
[02:05:56.720 --> 02:05:59.600]   and I know he's gonna agree with me, which is technology.
[02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:02.160]   Because if it becomes harder technologically
[02:06:02.160 --> 02:06:05.360]   for the authoritarian and more expensive for him
[02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:08.120]   to input or force his edicts,
[02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:10.040]   that is going to create a pocket of freedom
[02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:11.880]   regardless of what the masses think.
[02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:13.520]   And the masses, hold on, let me finish.
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:15.880]   The masses as a rule are not going to be able to think
[02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:17.360]   in general anyway.
[02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:19.760]   I have a much more elitist view of mankind than Rand does.
[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:21.280]   Let me give you one specific example,
[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:23.240]   which I mentioned in my book, then you write.
[02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:26.680]   Let's suppose it's 1990, not that long ago,
[02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:28.280]   we all remember 1990,
[02:06:28.280 --> 02:06:30.840]   and we're having an argument about censorship.
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:32.760]   And Yaron says, "I want full sense,
[02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:35.160]   "full freedom of the press, freedom of books,
[02:06:35.160 --> 02:06:37.520]   "publish whatever you want, whatever, free speech."
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:40.120]   And I say, "Well, what about books like Mein Kampf?
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:41.240]   "What about, you know, people read this,
[02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:42.120]   "they have the wrong idea.
[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:44.400]   "What about child pornography, things like this?
[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:45.840]   "Like, where are you gonna draw the line?"
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:47.000]   And we could argue along.
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.520]   Lex appears from the future, and he goes,
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:51.880]   "Hey guys, this conversation is moot."
[02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:54.400]   And we're like, "Lex, you look exactly the same."
[02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:56.440]   I'm like, "Yeah, of course, robots don't age."
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:58.600]   And you go, "I'm from the future."
[02:06:58.600 --> 02:07:00.360]   And I go, "Wait a minute, black president?"
[02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:04.160]   And you go, "Look, this conversation is moot
[02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:06.160]   "because in a few years from now,
[02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:08.560]   "you will be able to send any book,
[02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:11.440]   "anywhere on earth, at the speed of light.
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:15.560]   "You can make infinite copies in one second,
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:18.160]   "and you could send it to anyone such that
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:21.360]   "they can only open this book if they know a magic word."
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:23.080]   And I go, "Well, how much is this gonna cost?"
[02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:24.040]   "Oh, it's free."
[02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:26.240]   And I go, "Wait, wait, you're telling me
[02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:28.840]   "I can make infinite copies of any book
[02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:31.360]   "and teleport them at the speed of light,
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:32.680]   "anywhere for free?"
[02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:33.800]   And you would say, "Yes."
[02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:35.200]   We would think he's insane,
[02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:37.040]   but that's the status quo, right?
[02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:40.080]   So technology has done far more
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:43.720]   to fight government censorship of literature and ideas
[02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:46.040]   than has spreading the right ideas.
[02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:47.960]   So when you have things like crypto,
[02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:49.400]   which makes money less accessible
[02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:51.520]   than a gold block in your house,
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:52.720]   when you have things like people
[02:07:52.720 --> 02:07:54.240]   being able to travel quickly,
[02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:58.200]   those are also necessary compliments
[02:07:58.200 --> 02:07:59.400]   to having the right ideas.
[02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:02.400]   And Rand herself said that she couldn't have come up
[02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:04.840]   with her philosophy before the Industrial Revolution.
[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:08.240]   So as time goes forward, and we have more technology,
[02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:09.840]   and we have more discourse--
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:11.800]   - But for very different reasons, you said that, right?
[02:08:11.800 --> 02:08:14.160]   - Sure, but it's also a lot easier
[02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:16.120]   to persuade people of the right ideas.
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:18.400]   - So I kind of agree.
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:19.720]   Maybe I'm more pessimistic,
[02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:22.800]   or maybe I don't get the technology completely.
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:24.080]   - That's 'cause you're a boomer.
[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:24.920]   - There you go.
[02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:25.800]   (laughing)
[02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:26.640]   - Okay, boomer.
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:28.040]   - I get that insult a lot.
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:30.440]   (laughing)
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:32.680]   I think I'm the last year of the boomer generation.
[02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:34.200]   I think I hit that last year.
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:35.680]   It's a mindset, there you go.
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:37.800]   (laughing)
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:38.640]   - I love you so much.
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:42.040]   - So the reason she said she couldn't have developed her,
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:44.920]   the reason she said she couldn't develop the philosophy
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:46.560]   without the Industrial Revolution
[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:51.280]   is the link between reason and wealth
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:54.040]   was not obvious before the Industrial Revolution.
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:56.600]   And that, for example, it's not obvious to Aristotle.
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:08:57.760]   Aristotle doesn't see the link
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:08:59.960]   between rationality and wealth creation.
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:04.960]   Business is low, and money is barren.
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:07.360]   Money is barren.
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:09.080]   Interest has no productive function.
[02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:10.360]   Bankers don't have.
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:14.120]   So you had to see it existentially to be able to see
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:16.520]   reason is the source of wealth creation.
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:19.320]   So I think that's a little different.
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:22.800]   Now, there is a sense in which, yes,
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:25.800]   technology makes it more difficult for authoritarians
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:28.640]   to achieve their authoritarianism.
[02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:31.240]   I'm not convinced that they can't.
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:32.120]   - I didn't say can't.
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:32.960]   - Yeah.
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:33.800]   - Okay, I didn't say can't.
[02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:34.640]   - Yeah, so I don't think--
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:35.480]   - At a certain point, I'm just saying--
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:36.440]   - They can turn off the electricity.
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:37.640]   - I'm just saying it becomes more expensive.
[02:09:37.640 --> 02:09:40.080]   - Yes, it becomes more expensive, no question.
[02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:41.160]   It becomes more expensive.
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:46.240]   And we're still beings that live in a physical reality.
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:49.720]   Therefore, they can still harm us in this physical reality.
[02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:51.160]   - But let me say this.
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:52.480]   It's gonna sound as absurd.
[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:54.760]   If there was technology that we could teleport anywhere
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:55.960]   on Earth at the speed of light,
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:57.560]   that would certainly go a long way
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:09:59.280]   towards hurting authoritarianism.
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:00.960]   - Sure, if there was some way to go.
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:02.920]   And of course, they could teleport too.
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:04.520]   And this is, of course, the danger
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:07.120]   of they can use the technology too.
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:07.960]   - Sure, absolutely.
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:09.080]   - And look at what the Chinese are doing
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:12.320]   with social scores and with monitoring people
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:13.480]   and cameras everywhere.
[02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:16.640]   So there's a sense in which you probably had more privacy
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:17.480]   before some of the technology.
[02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:18.320]   - Oh, absolutely.
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:21.080]   - So it's not obvious to me that,
[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:23.240]   so to me, it's all about ideas.
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:25.160]   And if we don't get the ideas right,
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:27.120]   technology will be used for evil.
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:29.520]   Yes, and it will allow some of us maybe to escape
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:33.840]   for a little while in some realms, but others not.
[02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:36.960]   You know, Iran and North Korea do a pretty good job
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:39.040]   shutting themselves away from technology,
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:42.520]   although a lot gets through in the Iranian,
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:43.360]   at least with Iran.
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:45.800]   I don't know about North Korea, how much gets through.
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:47.720]   - It's real undermining them, which is wonderful.
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:49.080]   - Yeah, which is great.
[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:51.520]   So yes, but it's more than that.
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:54.520]   And this is what leads me to be optimistic.
[02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:56.880]   It's that we live in a world today
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:00.680]   where seven billion people basically have access
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:04.240]   to all of human knowledge, all of human knowledge.
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:07.280]   It's not like in Rome, when Rome fell,
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:08.560]   all of human knowledge disappeared.
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:10.400]   Now, some of it escaped to Byzantine,
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:11.600]   some of the Byzantines had,
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:13.040]   and ultimately land up with the Arabs
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:15.240]   and found its way back into Western civilization
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:16.240]   through them.
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:19.160]   But a lot of knowledge disappeared, just wiped out, right?
[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:21.280]   How to build a dome, how to build a big dome,
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:24.320]   how to have, you know, in Pompeii, they had faucets,
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:26.880]   that running water, and faucets.
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:29.840]   They didn't have faucets for another thousand years, right?
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:33.520]   A lot of, they couldn't build tall buildings
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:34.640]   once Rome came down.
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:37.200]   - The Great Pyramid of Egypt was the tallest building
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:39.240]   on earth till like 1840, it was crazy.
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:41.480]   - Rome was a city of a million people.
[02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:43.160]   Other than China, there wasn't another city
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:44.880]   of a million people in the West
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:48.400]   until London in the 19th century, 1500 years later.
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:51.640]   So it all disappeared because all of it was concentrated
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:52.880]   basically in one place.
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:54.720]   Today, none of that exists because of the internet,
[02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:58.160]   because of universities everywhere, institutions.
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:11:59.540]   I mean, think about how many engineers
[02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:01.360]   there are in the world today, right?
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:03.920]   Who have basically all different,
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:05.440]   basically the same level of knowledge
[02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:06.760]   on how to build stuff.
[02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:10.040]   So even if the United States went to some kind of dark ages,
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:11.920]   it's unlikely the whole world goes into
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:12.840]   that kind of dark ages.
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:15.640]   So I am optimistic in that sense
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:19.600]   that the fusion of knowledge is so broad today
[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:22.000]   that other than wiping out all the electricity
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.400]   on the planet, everything electronic on the planet,
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:27.160]   it's just, it's not gonna be possible to control us all.
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:30.160]   And in that sense, technology is gonna make it possible
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:33.640]   for us to survive and to stay semi-free,
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:35.440]   'cause I don't think full freedom, but semi-free.
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:37.200]   'Cause full freedom, you need the ideas.
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:38.440]   'Cause full freedom means you need
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:39.920]   some political implementation.
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:41.760]   - No, full freedom is anarchy, but we know that.
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:44.480]   - No, well, we need to get into that
[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:46.840]   because we can't leave without pointing out
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:48.480]   that we fundamentally disagree about that.
[02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:52.200]   - Oh, that's beautiful to be continued on that one.
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:54.780]   Let me ask about one particular technology
[02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:57.240]   that I've been learning a lot about,
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:12:59.120]   thinking a lot about, talking about,
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:01.080]   which is Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general,
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:04.560]   but Bitcoin specifically, which a lot of people argue
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:09.560]   that the Bitcoin, that setting ideas aside,
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:12.960]   when you look at practical tools
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:15.400]   that governments use to manipulate its people
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:19.480]   is inflation of the monetary, within the monetary system.
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:24.480]   And so they see Bitcoin as a way for individuals
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:27.520]   to fight that, to go outside those specific
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:29.780]   government-controlled systems,
[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:33.440]   and thereby sort of decentralizing power.
[02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:35.080]   There's a case to be made historically,
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:37.600]   the 20th century, that you couldn't have Stalin,
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:40.480]   you couldn't have Hitler, you couldn't have much of the evil
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:42.980]   that you see in the world if they couldn't control
[02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:43.820]   the monetary system.
[02:13:43.820 --> 02:13:45.080]   - You couldn't have had the New Deal.
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:46.880]   And FDR realized this very quickly.
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:48.960]   - Oh, yeah, that's why he confiscated all the gold.
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:51.680]   Everybody knows FDR is gonna come into,
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:53.760]   to become president and gonna confiscate the gold.
[02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:57.080]   So one of the mythologies, the myths
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:00.480]   about the Great Depression is that
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:02.760]   there were all these bank runs that,
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:06.600]   well, bank runs happened because everybody was afraid
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:08.520]   that FDR would get elected, confiscate the gold.
[02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:11.000]   So everybody ran to the bank and took the gold.
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.800]   Little did they realize that he would confiscate
[02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:15.520]   their private holdings in their own backyards.
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:17.320]   He would dig, he would force them to dig up the gold
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:18.160]   from their own backyard.
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:20.040]   But yes, one of the first things FDR did
[02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:22.440]   in spite of denying it throughout the campaign,
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:25.480]   he was asked about this over and over again and denied it.
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:28.160]   One of the first things was take over the gold
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:30.000]   and take the United States, the Federal Reserve
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:33.000]   off the gold standard so that they can, in a sense,
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.960]   print money and that he could start spending.
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:37.000]   - Yeah, what people don't realize,
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.280]   just to clarify what you're on set is FDR,
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:41.320]   this is something that's so crazy to us that we think,
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:42.720]   okay, I'm misunderstanding it.
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:46.720]   FDR made it illegal for people to own gold
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:48.200]   unless it's like a wedding ring.
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:53.200]   And before that, contracts, because inflation was a concern,
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:54.760]   I make a contract with your own.
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:57.040]   Right, I said, okay, you're either gonna pay me
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:00.360]   in $1,500 for my work or the gold equivalent
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:03.360]   because if that $1,500, you know,
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:05.800]   Weimar Germany and you have hyperinflation,
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:08.720]   I don't want that $1,500, just give me the gold bullion.
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:11.880]   And FDR said all of those clauses,
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:13.080]   he broke every contract.
[02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:14.360]   - No limit.
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:15.200]   - They don't matter.
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:17.880]   So now if I say, Eron says, okay,
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:20.160]   you owe me three feet of drywall.
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:23.440]   And I go, here's three feet of drywall, it's 12 inches.
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:25.400]   And you go, wait, wait, wait, three feet is 36 inches.
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:26.240]   You go, no, no, not anymore.
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:27.880]   I was like, what am I supposed to do?
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:30.720]   And because you have, when you print more money,
[02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:33.960]   the value of every individual dollar matters less,
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:37.920]   it becomes that much harder to plan anything,
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:40.200]   either in the government level or in the private level,
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:42.960]   because if I'm managing outlays,
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:44.200]   if I'm trying to pay my workers,
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:46.400]   I'm trying to build factories, I'm thinking long-term,
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:49.680]   and I don't know what this dollar is gonna buy in 10 years,
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:52.920]   that puts an enormous incentive for me to spend it now
[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:54.880]   and not save it, 'cause if I save it,
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:56.520]   it's gonna be worth a lot less.
[02:15:56.520 --> 02:15:58.160]   And the worst thing about inflation,
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:00.520]   and this is something I think people who are pro-capitalism
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:02.400]   don't talk about enough, they do talk about it,
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:03.800]   I would just like to see it more,
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:08.800]   this by far hurts the poorest of the poor the most.
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:11.840]   When we came to this country, my mom told me
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:14.200]   they would go to 86th Street in Bensonhurst
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:17.400]   with the fruit stands to buy Mikachka some grapes,
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:19.080]   and you go to this fruit stand,
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:21.040]   and she'd walk all the way to the other corner,
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:23.840]   and if it was three cents more a pound or less a pound,
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:26.680]   she'd walk all the way back, 'cause that three cents mattered.
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:28.520]   Now if I have this dollar,
[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:30.360]   and it's 5% inflation or whatever,
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:32.760]   and next year it's 95 cents,
[02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:34.960]   me and you, the three of us might not care,
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:37.280]   but if I'm destitute hand to mouth,
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:39.040]   and I've got 5% less,
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:42.680]   that is really a material consequence of my life.
[02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:45.640]   So inflation really is evil,
[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:48.600]   because it hurts the people for who those pennies matter.
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:50.720]   - Well, one of the ways the government gets around that,
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:52.920]   and it's because they get smart to that,
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:54.720]   is they index everything.
[02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:57.800]   So they index just the security, they index welfare,
[02:16:57.800 --> 02:16:58.640]   they try to make sure,
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:01.560]   but that only makes you more dependent on them.
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:03.600]   And the people in the modern context
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:06.920]   that the inflation hurts the most are savers,
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:08.120]   people trying to save money,
[02:17:08.120 --> 02:17:11.200]   and Fed policy right now is just horrific
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:15.360]   if you're a saver, 'cause the interest rates are zero,
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:16.800]   you get nothing on your saving,
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:19.240]   and cost of living is going up,
[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:21.200]   maybe not at a huge level, but it is going up,
[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:26.200]   and yet you can't even save to keep the value of your dollars.
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:28.760]   So- - Here's the other-
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:30.200]   - And the government controls,
[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:32.880]   and this has massive perverse effects,
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:35.240]   because it's not just the prices go up,
[02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:38.440]   it's the prices don't reflect reality anymore,
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:41.120]   so some prices go up, some prices might not.
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:43.680]   Investments get distorted, things get produced
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:44.560]   that shouldn't get produced,
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:47.280]   and then people like Richard Wolff turn around
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:49.880]   and blame all the distortions, and the perversions,
[02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:53.360]   and the crashes, and the financial crisis on capitalism,
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:54.760]   not on the fact that the Fed,
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:56.000]   look at the financial crisis,
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:59.400]   financial crisis was caused, you could argue by inflation,
[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:00.960]   and we could get into that if you wanted,
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:03.560]   but that's probably a three-hour show just that, right?
[02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:05.840]   It was caused by the Federal Reserve,
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:07.560]   and yet who got blamed for the financial crisis?
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:09.600]   Who would Richard Wolff is gonna jump up and down,
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:11.040]   this is a crisis of capitalism,
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:12.280]   this was caused by capitalism,
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:15.080]   but capitalism is the negation of the Fed,
[02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:17.560]   capitalism says there should be no Fed,
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:19.920]   that's item number one on the list
[02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:21.440]   of the things capitalists want,
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:25.160]   is to get rid of the Fed,
[02:18:25.160 --> 02:18:27.360]   and then grant you guys your wish,
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:28.720]   have competition for currency,
[02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:30.920]   and let's see if Bitcoin wins, I'm skeptical,
[02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:33.960]   but I don't care, my point is under freedom,
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:38.000]   I don't care who wins, I just want free choices,
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:39.600]   and let the best currency win,
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:41.560]   I doubt that becomes Bitcoin,
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:44.160]   but it doesn't really matter if I'm wrong, right?
[02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:46.720]   - Let me add to this, and I think people appreciate,
[02:18:46.720 --> 02:18:49.400]   and this is a leftist, leftism at its best,
[02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:50.720]   that the government and the banks
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:51.560]   are in bed with each other,
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:53.240]   this I don't think is particularly controversial statement.
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:54.680]   - Well, I don't like that statement,
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:55.520]   let me just say why I don't like it,
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:58.120]   and then I don't like it 'cause it assumes
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:18:59.280]   that they're equal partners,
[02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:02.480]   or that this causality goes in both directions.
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:05.400]   From day one, and this is really from day one,
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:07.480]   of the establishment of the United States,
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:09.840]   banks have been regulated by the state,
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:12.320]   and the reason for that is primarily Jefferson,
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:16.440]   and other founders distrust of finance.
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:18.400]   So from the beginning,
[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:20.440]   banks are being controlled by the state.
[02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:23.800]   Now, over time, if I'm controlling you,
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:25.080]   you wanna have influence over me,
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:27.920]   because I get to, so yes, they get into bed over time,
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:30.720]   but so I don't like it that they're in bed together,
[02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:32.560]   one is dominating over the other,
[02:19:32.560 --> 02:19:34.100]   and the other is participating,
[02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:34.940]   because what choice do they have?
[02:19:34.940 --> 02:19:37.040]   - I should explain to you how things work
[02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:40.140]   when you get in bed, and it's not always equal.
[02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:41.080]   - Well, okay, so--
[02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:43.560]   - Okay, so let's talk about safe words,
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:46.120]   which is a very Randian topic, she doesn't like those.
[02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:48.400]   Read the, I had to read that scene three times
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:49.600]   in the fountainhead as I quickly--
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:50.440]   - I'm sure you did.
[02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:51.260]   - I was reading.
[02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:52.100]   - I'm sure you did.
[02:19:52.100 --> 02:19:54.080]   - Yeah, no, 'cause I'm like, I looked at the back cover,
[02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:55.880]   I'm like, a woman wrote this book in 1943,
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:19:56.720]   I must be misunderstanding this scene.
[02:19:56.720 --> 02:19:57.600]   - And it's '43.
[02:19:57.600 --> 02:19:58.440]   - Yeah.
[02:19:58.440 --> 02:20:00.240]   - She sure had a lot of shades of gray.
[02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:03.120]   - Yeah, so, no, she hated that.
[02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:06.120]   Only black and white, no, but what I meant is,
[02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:09.440]   2008, right, you have the bailout of Wall Street,
[02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:12.600]   whereas in 2020, we saw every medium and small business
[02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:15.160]   under the sun go under, there's not even a pretense
[02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:17.200]   that these are going to be a bailed out.
[02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:19.600]   So the priorities of the politicians, in my view,
[02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:21.780]   are always gonna be towards powerful entities,
[02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:23.680]   powerful corporations, and they're not gonna be
[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:25.600]   about the medium guy, the middle guy.
[02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:26.720]   Let me just finish my point,
[02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:27.920]   'cause I see you champing at the bit.
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:29.440]   - Yep. (laughs)
[02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:32.060]   - At the very least, if you have regulation,
[02:20:32.060 --> 02:20:33.640]   people influencing each other.
[02:20:33.640 --> 02:20:38.200]   With Bitcoin and with crypto, that is not a possibility.
[02:20:38.200 --> 02:20:42.880]   You do not have any agency who is king of Bitcoin,
[02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:44.840]   who is the Federal Reserve of Bitcoin.
[02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:49.080]   There is no organizing, organization, management team.
[02:20:49.080 --> 02:20:51.360]   Now, you could say this is a bad thing,
[02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:54.400]   but you can't say that this is a different thing to money,
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:55.800]   as opposed to Federal Reserve System.
[02:20:55.800 --> 02:20:58.360]   - Yeah, so I agree with that description of Bitcoin,
[02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:00.320]   my problems with Bitcoin, and elsewhere.
[02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:03.360]   Let me just say about the financial crisis.
[02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:07.360]   I don't like it phrased that way again.
[02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:11.600]   They let Lehman go under, and destroyed Lehman Brothers.
[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:15.880]   In the past, they destroyed Drexel Burnham,
[02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:17.640]   because they didn't like Michael Merkin.
[02:21:17.640 --> 02:21:19.720]   They are vindictive. - Yes.
[02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:23.200]   - It's not an accident that the Treasury Secretary
[02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:26.080]   at the time was an ex-chairman of Goldman Sachs,
[02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:29.160]   not Lehman Brothers, and Goldman hates Lehman.
[02:21:29.160 --> 02:21:30.960]   And the next day, they bail out AIG.
[02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:34.520]   What I got out of financial crisis more than anything,
[02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:36.000]   and by the way, there wasn't a bailout,
[02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:37.320]   so it wasn't even a bailout,
[02:21:37.320 --> 02:21:40.040]   because they gave money to every bank,
[02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:42.400]   whether they had problems or not.
[02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:44.960]   And indeed, I know several bankers,
[02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:48.120]   including big banks like JP Morgan and West Fargo,
[02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:50.160]   and a friend of mine, John Allison of BB&T,
[02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:53.360]   who told them explicitly, "We don't want your money.
[02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:54.680]   "We don't need your money, we don't."
[02:21:54.680 --> 02:21:56.840]   And they were basically, a gun was put to their head,
[02:21:56.840 --> 02:21:58.480]   and they said, "You don't take the money,
[02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:00.240]   "we'll shut you down," basically, right?
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:02.000]   The equivalent of that.
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:06.560]   And so, they A, wanted a virtue signal.
[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:07.840]   So, there's a big virtue signal.
[02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:10.280]   We're taking care of things, don't worry.
[02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:11.520]   We've got everything under control,
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:13.120]   even though they were completely panicking,
[02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:15.280]   and they had no clue what they were doing.
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:18.520]   One of the things that the financial crisis
[02:22:18.520 --> 02:22:23.520]   really illustrated was how pathetic, ignorant,
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:26.120]   and incompetent the people at the top are,
[02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:27.320]   and they knew it.
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:29.280]   And so, Paulson goes to Congress,
[02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:31.160]   says, "Give me $700 billion.
[02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:33.540]   "Don't tell me how to use it, 'cause I have no clue.
[02:22:33.540 --> 02:22:35.720]   "Just give it to me, and give me authoritarian power
[02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:37.000]   "to do it any way I want."
[02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.640]   And that was not out of a sense of grandeur.
[02:22:39.640 --> 02:22:40.600]   That was a sense of panic.
[02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:41.520]   He had no idea.
[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:42.360]   He had no clue.
[02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:43.200]   None of them did.
[02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:47.040]   They bailed out everybody they could,
[02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:50.280]   everybody within their periphery.
[02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:51.960]   When they thought it was appropriate,
[02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:55.080]   they were vindictive about some people like Lehman.
[02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:57.440]   It was complete arbitrary use of power.
[02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:00.320]   The bankers didn't benefit from this.
[02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:03.160]   Indeed, many bankers that took their money lost from it.
[02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:06.280]   Bank stocks got crushed after the bailout.
[02:23:06.280 --> 02:23:08.800]   Before the bailout, bank stocks were doing okay,
[02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:10.520]   and right after top was announced,
[02:23:10.520 --> 02:23:13.640]   bank stocks crushed because this was bad for banks.
[02:23:13.640 --> 02:23:15.120]   It wasn't good for banks.
[02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:17.920]   This is just central planning gone amok.
[02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:21.080]   It's not them bailing out elites.
[02:23:21.080 --> 02:23:23.760]   It's them throwing money at a problem
[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:26.600]   without knowing what they would actually do
[02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:28.200]   and what the consequences would be.
[02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:32.040]   - Right, but the point, sorry, we agree.
[02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:34.200]   The focus will always be on bailing out elites.
[02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:35.040]   It's almost-
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:36.160]   - But little banks got money too.
[02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:37.600]   - No, I'm saying that last year,
[02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:40.520]   there's no talk of saving Ice and Vice,
[02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:44.200]   saving Century 21, saving all these other industries.
[02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:45.040]   - But sure they were.
[02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:46.720]   If you look, it's just, sure there was.
[02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:49.440]   If you look at what the Fed did,
[02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:53.480]   the Fed was bailing out third, fourth class businesses
[02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:55.040]   in all kinds of areas
[02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:57.400]   that you wouldn't consider elitist areas.
[02:23:57.400 --> 02:23:59.400]   Oh, PPP, the way-
[02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:00.440]   - You're talking 2008?
[02:24:00.440 --> 02:24:01.640]   - Yeah, no, I'm talking about now.
[02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:03.920]   I'm talking about COVID last year.
[02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:05.480]   What the Fed did was unbelievable.
[02:24:05.480 --> 02:24:08.640]   The kind of bonds that they were buying, even 2008,
[02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:11.640]   even after 2008, I couldn't believe what they did last year.
[02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:13.880]   PPP, the Payroll Protection Program,
[02:24:13.880 --> 02:24:15.040]   was targeted at everybody.
[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:16.280]   Everybody got PPP.
[02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:20.360]   It's not about, I don't think it's about bailing out elites.
[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:22.800]   It's about securing their power base.
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:24.840]   And if they believe that securing their power base
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:26.640]   is Wall Street, then they'll bail out Wall Street.
[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:28.080]   They believe securing their power base
[02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:32.080]   is writing checks to restaurant owners all over the country.
[02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:33.400]   They'll write checks to restaurant owners
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:36.400]   all over the country, which is what they did with PPP.
[02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:37.800]   It's all about power for them.
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:39.280]   And it's whatever will achieve power,
[02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:40.720]   whatever will result in power.
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:41.800]   I don't think it's about elites.
[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:45.560]   I don't see elitism in the bailouts of last year.
[02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:48.280]   - I agree, it wasn't last year.
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:50.760]   I'm saying that's one distinction between 2008 and 2020.
[02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:52.640]   And I do think, just one more thing.
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:56.160]   I do think getting in good bed with the elites
[02:24:56.160 --> 02:24:57.920]   is a great mechanism in general
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:24:59.160]   for maintaining one's power.
[02:24:59.160 --> 02:25:00.000]   - Oh yeah.
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:00.840]   - Yeah, that's not disputed.
[02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:01.680]   - Depending on how we define the elites.
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:03.520]   - Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:06.320]   - You mentioned there's some criticism towards Bitcoin.
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:09.680]   There's a lot of excitement about the technology of Bitcoin
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:14.680]   for the resistance against this kind of central
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:17.360]   state pursuit of power.
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:18.400]   - That's part of my criticism,
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:19.720]   'cause I don't think it works.
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:22.880]   So yeah, I can imagine a world,
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:26.680]   I can imagine, I'd love to see a technology evolve
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:30.480]   that where money is competitive
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:33.200]   and it's a financial instrument
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:34.520]   that the government cannot touch.
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:36.480]   - You think the state is too powerful in Bitcoin?
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:37.360]   - I think two things.
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:39.120]   I think right now,
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:41.240]   and maybe this won't be true in the future,
[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:43.880]   right now I think crypto is,
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:45.560]   it cannot function as money right now.
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:46.400]   It just can't.
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:48.160]   - But it does.
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:49.000]   - No, it doesn't.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:53.720]   It functions as a mechanism to transfer,
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:55.120]   it's a technology that allows me
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:57.960]   to transfer fiat money from place to place,
[02:25:57.960 --> 02:26:00.320]   but it doesn't function,
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:02.120]   because, and it can't because it's too volatile.
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:03.840]   - Wait, wait, I've sold things with Bitcoin.
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:05.200]   - No, I know you have.
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:06.080]   But I can sell things,
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:08.680]   I can buy things and sell things with my airline miles.
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:11.440]   There are lots of ways in which you can use things as money,
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:12.880]   but it doesn't make them money.
[02:26:12.880 --> 02:26:14.120]   - If you're using something as money, it's money.
[02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:15.840]   - So let me take something you, no.
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:17.480]   So let me take something you said before
[02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:19.280]   and it contradicts I think Bitcoin.
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:22.400]   You said one of the things about money is that it's stable.
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:24.560]   I know what it's gonna buy tomorrow, right?
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:25.840]   This is why we're against inflation,
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:28.240]   'cause I know what the dollar today I can plan,
[02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:29.160]   because I can't plan,
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:31.160]   I don't know what Bitcoin's gonna be worth tomorrow.
[02:26:31.160 --> 02:26:32.960]   So I can't plan with Bitcoin.
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:35.520]   Bitcoin is way too volatile to serve right now as money.
[02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:38.920]   Now, the argument from Bitcoin is this.
[02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:40.960]   Yes, it's still being adopted.
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:43.400]   At some point, it'll reach a certain crucial mass.
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:44.480]   - High point of coinization, yeah.
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:46.640]   - Yes, and then it will become money
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:48.640]   because at that point it can be used as money
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:51.240]   'cause they don't have a stable value.
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:54.760]   Maybe right now it's not useful as money
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:56.160]   because I can't predict what,
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:26:59.760]   I can't invest in it knowing what the value will be
[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:00.600]   in five years.
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:01.680]   Right now it's an asset.
[02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:04.840]   It's not a monetary unit.
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:06.680]   It's much more functions as an asset.
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:07.880]   Assets value can go up.
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:09.680]   - Oh, I agree it's functioning much more as an asset
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:10.720]   than as money, that's not in dispute.
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:11.560]   I agree with that completely.
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:13.440]   - So I don't think it's money.
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:17.000]   But so I think it's still,
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.880]   I think it can compete as a money with something tangible.
[02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:22.560]   So I think in a free market,
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:24.040]   some kind of crypto backed by gold
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:25.240]   would be more successful.
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:28.680]   - So Bitcoin folks argue that Bitcoin
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:32.160]   has all the same fundamental properties that does gold.
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:35.720]   So it's backed by, there's a scarcity to it
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:37.240]   and it's backed by proof of work.
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:41.320]   So it's backed by physical resources.
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:43.520]   And so they say that it's a very natural replacement
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:45.760]   of gold, so it doesn't need to be connected to gold.
[02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:48.520]   - So the two things that gold has that it doesn't have.
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:52.000]   One is gold is not finite.
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.280]   Gold supply actually grows over time.
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:56.760]   Bitcoin at some point is truly finite.
[02:27:56.760 --> 02:27:59.280]   At least unless you count the fact
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:00.840]   that you can split Bitcoins and create coins,
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:03.320]   but that's a whole other question, right?
[02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:05.320]   So that's one.
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:10.320]   The second is that gold has value
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:11.960]   beyond its use as a currency,
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:13.560]   beyond its use as-
[02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:15.920]   - For jewelry and stuff.
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:17.800]   - Yeah, but you minimize that,
[02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:19.640]   but jewelry and stuff has been important
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:21.760]   for the human race for a hundred thousand years.
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:24.120]   You can find jewelry in caves,
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:26.160]   for the cavemen designed jewelry and wore them.
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:29.160]   So we obviously as human beings value jewelry a lot.
[02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:32.400]   And almost all jewelry evolved to be made out of gold
[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:35.840]   because whatever it is within us is attracted to shiny,
[02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:38.160]   shiny gold in particular, shiny object generally.
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:40.680]   So there's something about gold that appeals to human being.
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:42.040]   There's some value that gold has
[02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:43.480]   beyond its being a currency.
[02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:46.120]   It doesn't, it's not, Bitcoin doesn't.
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:48.360]   Now it's not enough to use it as money.
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:50.200]   Lots of things appeal to human beings,
[02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:52.080]   but those are two characteristics.
[02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:53.560]   One, that it's not finite.
[02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:57.120]   And second, that it is a value beyond
[02:28:57.120 --> 02:28:59.040]   that Bitcoin doesn't have.
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:00.160]   - Don't you think the finiteness
[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:01.640]   could be framed as a feature?
[02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:03.000]   The scarcity of Bitcoin?
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.400]   - No, because I think it creates a real problem
[02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:06.600]   with scarcity economically.
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:09.080]   It's the issue of planning.
[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:11.360]   There is a mechanism,
[02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:13.160]   there's a beautiful mechanism in markets
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:17.160]   that as the supply of gold is in a sense,
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:19.160]   the quantity of gold is,
[02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:23.920]   prices are going down 'cause there's too little gold, right?
[02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:26.360]   So the value of gold in a sense in dollar terms,
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:27.920]   the prices are going down.
[02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:31.920]   What happens then is there's an incentive
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:34.720]   to then go mine for more gold, right?
[02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:36.880]   Because it becomes cheaper and cheaper to mine
[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:37.880]   as the price goes down.
[02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:39.400]   So you mine for more gold.
[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:41.640]   So it keeps increasing and it keeps increasing.
[02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:43.640]   Basically very correlated
[02:29:43.640 --> 02:29:45.920]   to the rate of increasing productivity.
[02:29:45.920 --> 02:29:48.080]   That's the beauty of gold mining
[02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:50.680]   'cause prices are related to gold.
[02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:52.640]   Gold is the dominant money
[02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:54.800]   and it increases at just about the same rate
[02:29:54.800 --> 02:29:55.640]   as productivity.
[02:29:55.640 --> 02:29:59.960]   So it keeps prices relatively stable.
[02:29:59.960 --> 02:30:02.360]   You still have bouts of inflation and deflation,
[02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:04.040]   but it keeps it relatively stable.
[02:30:04.040 --> 02:30:06.600]   With Bitcoin, it's finite, it's ends.
[02:30:06.600 --> 02:30:08.320]   Now prices will only decline.
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:09.640]   What rate will they decline at?
[02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.640]   They'll decline at the rate of productivity increases.
[02:30:12.640 --> 02:30:13.880]   It's hard to predict what product,
[02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:15.480]   at the rate to which productivity increases.
[02:30:15.480 --> 02:30:16.800]   For example, technological shocks
[02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:18.760]   can change that dramatically.
[02:30:18.760 --> 02:30:22.280]   You could get bouts of dramatic deflation,
[02:30:22.280 --> 02:30:26.320]   dramatic price drops that could be problematic
[02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:29.800]   in terms of planning the same problem of inflation
[02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:31.440]   just reversed that you had before.
[02:30:31.440 --> 02:30:34.200]   So, again, it's a technical issue.
[02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:35.600]   I'm sure there are ways to get around it.
[02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:37.520]   And again, I'm not sure.
[02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:41.320]   I don't know if you guys consider Bitcoin the end
[02:30:41.320 --> 02:30:43.880]   or the beginning, that is, is Bitcoin it?
[02:30:43.880 --> 02:30:46.280]   Or is Bitcoin just the first example of a technology
[02:30:46.280 --> 02:30:47.120]   that might evolve in the future?
[02:30:47.120 --> 02:30:48.640]   I was just gonna say,
[02:30:48.640 --> 02:30:51.000]   there's the same technological issue with regard to gold,
[02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:52.640]   which is we now have the technology
[02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:55.080]   that was very expensive to turn elements
[02:30:55.080 --> 02:30:56.200]   into different elements.
[02:30:56.200 --> 02:30:59.360]   And at a certain, yeah, you could fire electrons at it
[02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:00.360]   or whatever, you can make gold.
[02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:01.200]   They figured out how to do it.
[02:31:01.200 --> 02:31:04.160]   It's not cheap and it's all big process.
[02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:06.920]   If gold is the standard,
[02:31:06.920 --> 02:31:09.120]   a lot of resources are gonna be going toward
[02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:10.520]   turning other things into gold,
[02:31:10.520 --> 02:31:12.200]   making the production of gold cheaper.
[02:31:12.200 --> 02:31:14.480]   And that's gonna have a similar consequence
[02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:16.080]   that Lauren's talking about.
[02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:17.720]   That's kind of the category of security
[02:31:17.720 --> 02:31:18.840]   that Bitcoin has talked about,
[02:31:18.840 --> 02:31:21.560]   that it's very difficult to do that with Bitcoin.
[02:31:21.560 --> 02:31:23.480]   But I would argue that it's exceptionally difficult
[02:31:23.480 --> 02:31:24.320]   to do that with gold.
[02:31:24.320 --> 02:31:26.440]   It is now, but the thing is, there's not a huge incentive.
[02:31:26.440 --> 02:31:30.840]   If gold is the basis and if gold is worth that much.
[02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:31.880]   But gold isn't worth that much.
[02:31:31.880 --> 02:31:32.800]   Gold is worth, let's say-
[02:31:32.800 --> 02:31:34.200]   I'm saying in this world that we're talking about.
[02:31:34.200 --> 02:31:35.720]   In the future, yeah.
[02:31:35.720 --> 02:31:37.040]   Gold is not gonna be worth more.
[02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:39.160]   Let's say right now gold is about 2000 bucks.
[02:31:39.160 --> 02:31:41.400]   It's less than 2000, but let's say it's 2000 bucks.
[02:31:41.400 --> 02:31:44.480]   That's its price in terms of dollars.
[02:31:44.480 --> 02:31:47.000]   So you'd have to, it would have to be worthwhile
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:48.320]   to create something of $2,000.
[02:31:48.320 --> 02:31:49.840]   How much would you be willing to put into it?
[02:31:49.840 --> 02:31:51.080]   At some point, you're right.
[02:31:51.080 --> 02:31:53.320]   And at that point, I think gold stops being money.
[02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:54.160]   Right.
[02:31:54.160 --> 02:31:55.000]   'Cause it's useless.
[02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.920]   Once I can create it like silicon,
[02:31:57.920 --> 02:31:59.800]   then why not say I can make out official gold?
[02:31:59.800 --> 02:32:02.920]   So I'm just not, I don't think Bitcoin is the solution.
[02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:06.120]   I think, I don't know what the solution is.
[02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:08.480]   I wish I was that innovative,
[02:32:08.480 --> 02:32:10.920]   but I think you need a solution
[02:32:10.920 --> 02:32:13.480]   that has more of the characteristics of gold
[02:32:13.480 --> 02:32:14.560]   than Bitcoin currently has.
[02:32:14.560 --> 02:32:19.560]   And I guess I'm surprised at a lot of the technologists
[02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:22.600]   who view Bitcoin as the end game,
[02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:25.560]   where it strikes me as it's the birth of a new,
[02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:27.600]   it represents the birth of a new technology.
[02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:29.840]   And who the winner in that technology is gonna be,
[02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:31.000]   we have no clue.
[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:32.640]   Bitcoin is one of the players.
[02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:34.000]   There are other players.
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.440]   There might be a new technology
[02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:38.440]   that is even better than anything we can imagine right now.
[02:32:38.440 --> 02:32:42.200]   So Bitcoin doesn't strike me as optimal
[02:32:42.200 --> 02:32:44.360]   and that we should be moving towards something better.
[02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:49.360]   Can you please stop shilling Rand coin for five minutes?
[02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:52.200]   You know where there was Rand coin?
[02:32:52.200 --> 02:32:53.960]   There was Rand. South Africa.
[02:32:53.960 --> 02:32:54.800]   No, I was-
[02:32:54.800 --> 02:32:56.240]   There are currencies in Rand.
[02:32:56.240 --> 02:32:57.080]   No, I mean-
[02:32:57.080 --> 02:32:59.320]   Ayn Rand is the South African $1.
[02:32:59.320 --> 02:33:03.360]   Ayn Rand coin was, I was in China in 20,
[02:33:03.360 --> 02:33:05.200]   I think it was 2015 or 14.
[02:33:05.200 --> 02:33:06.040]   What's that?
[02:33:06.040 --> 02:33:06.880]   China. China.
[02:33:06.880 --> 02:33:10.320]   I was in China 20, something like that.
[02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:12.480]   And this entrepreneur came up to me.
[02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:16.280]   She said, she's bought this massive quantity of land
[02:33:16.280 --> 02:33:19.120]   in this area in China, it's a little secluded.
[02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:21.480]   She's starting what she's calling Gold Gulch.
[02:33:21.480 --> 02:33:22.600]   She's serious.
[02:33:22.600 --> 02:33:27.400]   And she's issuing, and she issued cryptocurrency
[02:33:27.400 --> 02:33:30.080]   based on the land, right backed by the land,
[02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:32.000]   called Rand, but Ayn Rand,
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.880]   with a little portrait of Ayn,
[02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:36.520]   little portrait in the marketing.
[02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:38.320]   Ayn Rand, I don't think it went anyway.
[02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:39.960]   You're not gonna be a janitor?
[02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:43.240]   A janitor in China at Gold Gulch, yeah.
[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:45.120]   By the way, I do wanna point out something
[02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:47.000]   I do enjoy about objectivists.
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:50.800]   I constantly talk about Ayn Rand and her vampire novels.
[02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:51.720]   Ayn.
[02:33:51.720 --> 02:33:53.920]   That's the joke you're on, thank you.
[02:33:53.920 --> 02:33:57.200]   And inevitably someone feels they need to point out
[02:33:57.200 --> 02:33:59.320]   that she did not write vampire novels
[02:33:59.320 --> 02:34:00.440]   and her name is actually Ayn.
[02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:02.400]   So thank you, thank you, Aaron.
[02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:03.720]   We've been talking for two hours.
[02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:05.080]   I own her copy of "The Fountainhead."
[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:07.840]   Somehow I thought her name was Ayn, thank you, thank you.
[02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:08.840]   Ayn is an anthem.
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:13.400]   - So this is really interesting way of phrasing it,
[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:15.440]   which is- - I was kidding with the Ayn.
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:17.400]   I know you knew how to pronounce it.
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:18.640]   - I know you know, you know.
[02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:21.040]   - Yeah, I just got confusing.
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:22.080]   - I think we all know,
[02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:24.360]   and we all know that we're jokers here.
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:27.160]   There's no Batman in this conversation.
[02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:28.000]   (laughs)
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:29.760]   - So it's an interesting way to frame it.
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:32.000]   Is Bitcoin the end or the beginning of something?
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:35.440]   And I've, as sort of with an open mind
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:37.200]   and seeing kind of all the possibilities
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:38.360]   of technologies out there,
[02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:40.440]   I also kind of thought that Bitcoin
[02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:41.960]   is the beginning of something.
[02:34:41.960 --> 02:34:44.560]   But what the Bitcoin community argues
[02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:49.280]   is that Bitcoin is the end of the base layer.
[02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:52.160]   Meaning all the different innovations
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:53.440]   will come on top of it.
[02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:55.120]   Like for example, there's something called
[02:34:55.120 --> 02:34:58.240]   lightning network, where it's basically
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:00.400]   just like gold is the end.
[02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:02.480]   And everything is built like the monetary systems,
[02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:04.920]   like cash and all that is built on top of gold.
[02:35:04.920 --> 02:35:08.320]   Bitcoin is the end in that other technologies
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:10.000]   are built on top of Bitcoin.
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.320]   That's their argument.
[02:35:11.320 --> 02:35:12.160]   And there's an interesting component.
[02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:13.520]   - I get that and I hear that all the time.
[02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:16.760]   And I just, I don't quite understand that.
[02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:19.360]   And I think Bitcoin has limitations
[02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:22.440]   that potentially other cryptocurrencies might not have.
[02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:24.160]   I, you know, my attitude to it,
[02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:25.880]   something like this is large extent
[02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:28.080]   I don't understand technology.
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:30.520]   My view is let it play out.
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:35.520]   I think I have more fear of physical,
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:41.440]   the ability of the government to crush these things
[02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:42.920]   than I think many in the community.
[02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:46.120]   So for example, so I gave a talk,
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:48.400]   Bitcoin, you know, and they were hyping
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:50.760]   the acceptance now, a lot of vendors
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:52.400]   are willing to accept Bitcoin and this is great.
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:53.880]   And I said, yeah, it's absolutely great.
[02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:56.960]   I mean, more options is better than few options.
[02:35:56.960 --> 02:36:00.320]   But I said, you know, that that could be taken away like that.
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:03.080]   Now it's true that we could exchange Bitcoin
[02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:05.080]   and the government wouldn't know,
[02:36:05.080 --> 02:36:06.920]   I think wouldn't know that we do.
[02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:08.960]   But once he's advertising on his website
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:12.280]   that he accepts Bitcoin, or once he tries to turn his Bitcoin
[02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:15.480]   into particular goods, once you manifest it
[02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:18.800]   in the physical world, now the government can step in.
[02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:20.480]   So the government could say, you can't sell anything
[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:22.720]   to anybody using Bitcoin.
[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:24.560]   They can do that and you won't be able to sell it.
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:26.440]   It will be, you have to go into the black market.
[02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:27.280]   So--
[02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:28.120]   - But that isn't able to sell it,
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:29.480]   just to just sell you in the black market.
[02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:31.440]   - Yeah, but that's where the government thrives, right?
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:32.800]   The government thrives on letting you do stuff
[02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:34.080]   in the black market so they can decide
[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:35.800]   when to put you in jail or not, right?
[02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:39.200]   So if I'm buying a sweatshirt from the government,
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:40.360]   sorry, if I'm buying a sweatshirt
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:42.000]   from somebody using Bitcoin,
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:45.480]   the government can't monitor my exchange of Bitcoin to him.
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:49.320]   But they can monitor the sweatshirt being sent to me, right?
[02:36:49.320 --> 02:36:50.880]   That's where they can interfere.
[02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:53.040]   And I think that at some point,
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:57.160]   to the extent Bitcoin is successful, it will be stopped.
[02:36:57.160 --> 02:37:00.360]   That is, and that's what'll stop it from becoming money.
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:02.920]   See, money can only become money,
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:05.560]   it can only become money if people are using it as money,
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:06.400]   right?
[02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:08.120]   And if the government can stop it being used,
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:11.200]   if I can't go to the grocery store and use my ATM
[02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:15.520]   that charges on Bitcoin or whatever, then it's not money.
[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:18.760]   And I think that the government is going to step in
[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:21.600]   and stop people from doing that.
[02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:26.240]   And that's what I, so I have more respect and fear
[02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:30.400]   for the power of government today.
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:31.640]   - I don't see that at all.
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:33.320]   However, I could be wrong.
[02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:35.640]   And I'm sure Yaron hopes he's wrong.
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:36.480]   - Absolutely.
[02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:37.320]   (laughing)
[02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:38.440]   I hope the government just give in
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:42.040]   and the Fed, Tamar says, "Yeah, let Bitcoin thrive."
[02:37:42.040 --> 02:37:43.960]   But I think they'll want to regulate and control it.
[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:47.440]   The only way to regulate and control it is to stop it.
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:48.720]   - Yeah, there's a bunch of people who argue
[02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:52.080]   that Bitcoin is too compelling to government
[02:37:52.080 --> 02:37:54.440]   that they'll actually embrace it like a choice--
[02:37:54.440 --> 02:37:56.960]   - But that assumes government has positive goals
[02:37:56.960 --> 02:37:58.280]   and wants to do good things.
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:37:59.120]   You can ask--
[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:01.080]   - No, no, it's greedy.
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:03.620]   They say government is greedy because they,
[02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:05.200]   well, Bitcoiners have this whole lingo.
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:06.560]   They say, "Number go up."
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:08.400]   - Government is not greedy.
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:11.280]   Government is not greedy for money.
[02:38:11.280 --> 02:38:12.840]   Government is greedy for power.
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:15.320]   Government is greedy for control.
[02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:16.400]   Government is much more,
[02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:17.720]   now money's good too.
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:19.300]   They'll take the money if they can get it.
[02:38:19.300 --> 02:38:21.560]   But it's not fundamentally about money.
[02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:23.760]   It's fundamentally, and this is something
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:26.000]   that many libertarians don't understand.
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.620]   This is something many of the Bitcoin community
[02:38:27.620 --> 02:38:28.600]   don't understand.
[02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:33.320]   They have far too benevolent a view of politicians
[02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:34.760]   and the people in government today.
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:35.600]   - By the way, I'm a liar.
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:36.740]   - And I know why he's laughing.
[02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:37.580]   I think I know why he's laughing.
[02:38:37.580 --> 02:38:38.840]   - You know exactly why I'm laughing.
[02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:42.540]   - And we should get to that issue at some point here.
[02:38:42.540 --> 02:38:47.540]   But, you know, so I think there's a lot of naivete.
[02:38:47.540 --> 02:38:48.580]   - Yeah, there's a lot.
[02:38:48.580 --> 02:38:49.400]   - Speaking of naivete.
[02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:51.240]   - A lot of it, Jaron.
[02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:52.580]   - No, I'm not naive.
[02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:55.540]   I'm actually providing the warning
[02:38:55.540 --> 02:38:57.520]   and all these Bitcoiners are saying,
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:38:59.300]   "No, no, no, government doesn't function that way."
[02:38:59.300 --> 02:39:00.780]   - No one says I'm naive.
[02:39:00.780 --> 02:39:02.620]   Naive people think they're not naive.
[02:39:02.620 --> 02:39:04.940]   - Well, so let's put this on the table.
[02:39:04.940 --> 02:39:09.220]   Speaking of naive, I still, more than the two of you,
[02:39:09.220 --> 02:39:13.140]   by far, I think, have faith that government can work.
[02:39:13.140 --> 02:39:14.660]   Okay, let's put that on the table.
[02:39:14.660 --> 02:39:16.260]   - I got it, I'm not trying to be pedantic.
[02:39:16.260 --> 02:39:17.500]   What do you mean, work?
[02:39:17.500 --> 02:39:21.260]   Government can achieve goals, that is not in dispute.
[02:39:21.260 --> 02:39:25.860]   - Can achieve goals effectively to build a better world.
[02:39:25.860 --> 02:39:26.700]   - Okay.
[02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:28.180]   - A functioning society.
[02:39:28.180 --> 02:39:31.300]   - So I'm gonna take it one step further than you.
[02:39:31.300 --> 02:39:32.340]   - Oh, boy.
[02:39:32.340 --> 02:39:35.380]   - The only way to achieve a better world
[02:39:35.380 --> 02:39:36.900]   is through government.
[02:39:38.460 --> 02:39:40.140]   - Michael, what do you think about that?
[02:39:40.140 --> 02:39:40.980]   - He almost dropped it.
[02:39:40.980 --> 02:39:42.140]   I said it on purpose that way.
[02:39:42.140 --> 02:39:44.580]   - I'm glad that the mask is dropping.
[02:39:44.580 --> 02:39:49.300]   - You cannot achieve, you cannot have liberty or freedom
[02:39:49.300 --> 02:39:50.620]   without a government.
[02:39:50.620 --> 02:39:53.340]   Now, not anything like the governments we have today.
[02:39:53.340 --> 02:39:57.700]   So I think the idea that you can have liberty or freedom
[02:39:57.700 --> 02:40:00.420]   without government is the rejection
[02:40:00.420 --> 02:40:02.740]   of the idea of liberty and freedom.
[02:40:02.740 --> 02:40:06.660]   And the undermining of any effort, any attempt to do it.
[02:40:06.660 --> 02:40:07.500]   So in that sense, I do--
[02:40:07.500 --> 02:40:08.660]   - He's sitting right here, right?
[02:40:08.660 --> 02:40:09.980]   - Lex, I know, exactly.
[02:40:09.980 --> 02:40:12.580]   On this side, we can agree with Lex, which is unusual.
[02:40:12.580 --> 02:40:13.420]   - That government is good for freedom.
[02:40:13.420 --> 02:40:15.940]   - You're agreeing with the guy who's reading Mein Kampf.
[02:40:15.940 --> 02:40:16.780]   That's not a surprise.
[02:40:16.780 --> 02:40:17.940]   - Who's dressed in black.
[02:40:17.940 --> 02:40:19.540]   - Yeah, that's the bad guys.
[02:40:19.540 --> 02:40:24.540]   - No, the fascism, I mean, the road to fascism is anarchy.
[02:40:24.540 --> 02:40:26.700]   It's not--
[02:40:26.700 --> 02:40:28.980]   - What the hell are you talking about?
[02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:32.140]   Can you give me one example of when anarchy led to fascism?
[02:40:32.140 --> 02:40:35.820]   - Well, every example of a stateless society
[02:40:35.820 --> 02:40:37.620]   leads to authoritarianism, every single one
[02:40:37.620 --> 02:40:39.060]   in all of human history.
[02:40:39.060 --> 02:40:39.900]   It has to because--
[02:40:39.900 --> 02:40:43.460]   - Wait, you're saying Weimar Germany was anarchy?
[02:40:43.460 --> 02:40:46.100]   - Well, it wasn't pure anarchy, but it got close.
[02:40:46.100 --> 02:40:48.660]   But no, I said the reverse, by the way.
[02:40:48.660 --> 02:40:49.700]   I said the reverse.
[02:40:49.700 --> 02:40:52.580]   I didn't say that every form of authoritarianism
[02:40:52.580 --> 02:40:53.660]   started with anarchy.
[02:40:53.660 --> 02:40:55.780]   I said that every situation in which human beings
[02:40:55.780 --> 02:40:59.700]   lived under anarchy led to authoritarianism.
[02:40:59.700 --> 02:41:01.100]   So I said the flip.
[02:41:01.100 --> 02:41:02.780]   - Anarchism isn't a location.
[02:41:02.780 --> 02:41:04.500]   Anarchism is a relationship.
[02:41:04.500 --> 02:41:07.140]   The three of us are in an anarchist relationship.
[02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:09.860]   Every country is in a relationship of anarchy
[02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:10.700]   toward each other.
[02:41:10.700 --> 02:41:12.700]   The US and Canada have an anarchist relationship
[02:41:12.700 --> 02:41:13.980]   toward one another.
[02:41:13.980 --> 02:41:18.980]   And to claim, going back to Emma Goldman, who I love,
[02:41:18.980 --> 02:41:24.380]   in 1901, William McKinley, President McKinley,
[02:41:24.380 --> 02:41:26.940]   was shot by this guy Leon Salgas.
[02:41:26.940 --> 02:41:30.620]   And it was very funny, but he was a crazy person.
[02:41:30.620 --> 02:41:31.980]   And they arrested him.
[02:41:31.980 --> 02:41:33.360]   He shot the president.
[02:41:33.360 --> 02:41:36.460]   And they go, "Why did you shoot President McKinley?"
[02:41:36.460 --> 02:41:39.220]   And he just goes, "I was radicalized by Emma Goldman."
[02:41:39.220 --> 02:41:40.900]   And she's like, "Oh, God damn it."
[02:41:40.900 --> 02:41:42.140]   So now she's on the lam.
[02:41:42.140 --> 02:41:43.740]   She had nothing to do with this guy.
[02:41:43.740 --> 02:41:45.520]   She's trying to flee.
[02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:46.780]   She gets arrested.
[02:41:46.780 --> 02:41:48.220]   They caught her.
[02:41:48.220 --> 02:41:52.040]   And she said, and this is the hubris of this woman,
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:54.540]   which I admire as the subject of being good hubris.
[02:41:54.540 --> 02:41:57.420]   She goes, "I'd like to thank the cops
[02:41:57.420 --> 02:41:58.720]   "for doing what they're doing.
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:00.640]   "They're turning far more people into anarchism
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:02.460]   "than I could do on my own."
[02:42:02.460 --> 02:42:07.460]   So given everything you've said in these two hours,
[02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:11.140]   and then to pivot to being anti-government
[02:42:11.140 --> 02:42:15.020]   is being anti-liberty, I don't feel I have to say anything.
[02:42:15.020 --> 02:42:15.980]   - Well, okay. - That's right.
[02:42:15.980 --> 02:42:18.100]   - For people who are not familiar, if you're,
[02:42:18.100 --> 02:42:19.940]   I don't know why you would not be familiar,
[02:42:19.940 --> 02:42:23.340]   but Michael Malice talks quite a bit
[02:42:23.340 --> 02:42:26.140]   about the evils of the state and government,
[02:42:26.140 --> 02:42:30.500]   and espouses ideas that anarchism is actually,
[02:42:30.500 --> 02:42:33.060]   what is it, the most moral system,
[02:42:33.060 --> 02:42:36.180]   the most effective system for human relationships.
[02:42:36.180 --> 02:42:38.440]   - There's this great book called "Atlas Shrugged,"
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:41.900]   and the author posits an anarchist private society.
[02:42:41.900 --> 02:42:43.460]   She calls it Galt's Gulch,
[02:42:43.460 --> 02:42:45.260]   where everything is privately owned,
[02:42:45.260 --> 02:42:48.040]   and no one is in a position of authority
[02:42:48.040 --> 02:42:50.020]   over anyone else other than the landowner.
[02:42:50.020 --> 02:42:50.860]   That's an anarchist society.
[02:42:50.860 --> 02:42:54.540]   - And there's one judge and one authority.
[02:42:54.540 --> 02:42:55.380]   - Yeah, and that's what everyone--
[02:42:55.380 --> 02:42:57.420]   - So if you violate, no tools.
[02:42:57.420 --> 02:43:00.020]   - And that's what everyone has voluntarily moved there
[02:43:00.020 --> 02:43:00.860]   and agreed to be under.
[02:43:00.860 --> 02:43:02.180]   - It's a very small community, right?
[02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:03.420]   - Sure, that is right.
[02:43:03.420 --> 02:43:06.380]   So I have no problem with competing governments.
[02:43:06.380 --> 02:43:08.420]   - That's the definition of anarchism.
[02:43:08.420 --> 02:43:09.260]   - What's that?
[02:43:09.260 --> 02:43:10.220]   - That's the definition of anarchism.
[02:43:10.220 --> 02:43:11.300]   Case closed, okay, end the show.
[02:43:11.300 --> 02:43:12.180]   - No, no, no, no, no. - End the show,
[02:43:12.180 --> 02:43:13.340]   I got him over.
[02:43:13.340 --> 02:43:14.860]   - Not definition of-- - Mission accomplished.
[02:43:14.860 --> 02:43:17.060]   - Not definition of anarchy at all.
[02:43:17.060 --> 02:43:18.580]   I'm all for competing governments.
[02:43:18.580 --> 02:43:19.780]   - Hold on, you get more cookies.
[02:43:19.780 --> 02:43:21.940]   Good job, he did it, he did it.
[02:43:21.940 --> 02:43:23.940]   Yay, Aaron, you brought him over.
[02:43:23.940 --> 02:43:25.460]   Red Rover brought him over. - More Lithuanian.
[02:43:25.460 --> 02:43:27.020]   (both laughing)
[02:43:27.020 --> 02:43:27.860]   - What is this clout, Jeff?
[02:43:27.860 --> 02:43:30.340]   - I'm Lithuanian, that's my people.
[02:43:30.340 --> 02:43:33.700]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:43:33.700 --> 02:43:34.820]   - It's honey. - Oh, it's honey.
[02:43:34.820 --> 02:43:36.700]   - No claims of health or nutrition.
[02:43:36.700 --> 02:43:37.660]   (both laughing)
[02:43:37.660 --> 02:43:40.220]   - The other one claimed health, this one no claims.
[02:43:40.220 --> 02:43:42.260]   No, I'm for competing governments
[02:43:42.260 --> 02:43:43.980]   on different geographic areas.
[02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:46.300]   That's fine.
[02:43:46.300 --> 02:43:48.340]   - Why does it have to be over, okay, let me--
[02:43:48.340 --> 02:43:50.780]   - It's really crucial that it's on different,
[02:43:50.780 --> 02:43:54.540]   so you don't have two judges in Gold Sculpture,
[02:43:54.540 --> 02:43:55.660]   you have one.
[02:43:55.660 --> 02:43:56.780]   And there's a reason why.
[02:43:56.780 --> 02:44:00.140]   There's one authority, there's one system of laws
[02:44:00.140 --> 02:44:03.380]   in Gold Sculpture that all the people
[02:44:03.380 --> 02:44:05.260]   under the Gulch abide by, there's one.
[02:44:05.260 --> 02:44:07.340]   - There's two, 'cause they're in America.
[02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:09.380]   - No, they're not, the whole point is they're not, right?
[02:44:09.380 --> 02:44:11.020]   - They're not in America, they're in Colorado.
[02:44:11.020 --> 02:44:12.860]   - I know, but the whole point of the novel
[02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:14.100]   is they've left America.
[02:44:14.100 --> 02:44:15.460]   - They haven't left America.
[02:44:15.460 --> 02:44:16.660]   - They've hid themselves, so they're not
[02:44:16.660 --> 02:44:17.740]   under the authority of the American government.
[02:44:17.740 --> 02:44:19.340]   - But they are, don't you get it?
[02:44:19.340 --> 02:44:20.660]   - But they're hidden, they're supposed to be--
[02:44:20.660 --> 02:44:22.060]   - The whole point is that they're hidden
[02:44:22.060 --> 02:44:23.220]   so they're not under the--
[02:44:23.220 --> 02:44:26.260]   - No, no, no, if the three of us hide,
[02:44:26.260 --> 02:44:28.620]   we're still under the authority of Washington.
[02:44:28.620 --> 02:44:30.300]   - No, but not if they don't know that we exist.
[02:44:30.300 --> 02:44:32.180]   - But this is why they haven't established a state,
[02:44:32.180 --> 02:44:35.340]   and it's not a government, and it's not in that sense
[02:44:35.340 --> 02:44:42.700]   an example of really the way we form societies.
[02:44:42.700 --> 02:44:45.820]   It is a private club that is hidden away
[02:44:45.820 --> 02:44:46.660]   from everybody else.
[02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:48.020]   - Fine, I'm fine with that.
[02:44:48.020 --> 02:44:50.860]   What happens if an American kills a Canadian in Mexico?
[02:44:50.860 --> 02:44:54.060]   - What happens if an American, it depends,
[02:44:54.060 --> 02:44:55.380]   depends on the nature of the governments
[02:44:55.380 --> 02:44:56.220]   of the three places.
[02:44:56.220 --> 02:45:00.100]   - Right, but usually what happens in most of human history
[02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:02.140]   is that America will launch a war
[02:45:02.140 --> 02:45:03.820]   either against Mexico or Canada.
[02:45:03.820 --> 02:45:05.700]   - Okay, just first of all--
[02:45:05.700 --> 02:45:08.620]   - So usually violence results in much more violence.
[02:45:08.620 --> 02:45:11.460]   Anarchy is just a system that legalizes violence,
[02:45:11.460 --> 02:45:13.420]   that's all it does, and in international affairs,
[02:45:13.420 --> 02:45:14.260]   that's the reality.
[02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:17.380]   The reality is that the way you resolve disputes
[02:45:17.380 --> 02:45:19.460]   that are major disputes is through violence.
[02:45:19.460 --> 02:45:23.220]   - Ayn Rand said the definition of a government
[02:45:23.220 --> 02:45:25.740]   is an agency that has a monopoly of force
[02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:27.100]   in a geographical area.
[02:45:27.100 --> 02:45:30.060]   So you can't complain that anarchism
[02:45:30.060 --> 02:45:33.060]   is legalizing violence when the definition of government,
[02:45:33.060 --> 02:45:35.700]   according to Rand, is legalized violence.
[02:45:35.700 --> 02:45:39.300]   - No, because you're taking the definition of violence
[02:45:39.300 --> 02:45:41.540]   the way she defines it, right, in this context.
[02:45:41.540 --> 02:45:44.220]   A, she talks about retaliatory force only.
[02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:45.780]   - Has that ever happened?
[02:45:45.780 --> 02:45:46.620]   - That's not the point.
[02:45:46.620 --> 02:45:47.460]   - That is the point.
[02:45:47.460 --> 02:45:49.220]   - Before there was Aristotle, was there an Aristotle?
[02:45:49.220 --> 02:45:51.200]   Before there was an America, was there an America?
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:52.980]   The fact that something has never existed
[02:45:52.980 --> 02:45:54.700]   means it will never exist before.
[02:45:54.700 --> 02:45:57.220]   The fact that the ideas haven't been developed
[02:45:57.220 --> 02:45:59.580]   to make something exist means that it will never exist
[02:45:59.580 --> 02:46:03.020]   before, you know, we're young, human race is a young race.
[02:46:03.020 --> 02:46:05.460]   The ideas of freedom are very young.
[02:46:05.460 --> 02:46:08.220]   The ideas of the enlightenment are just 250 years old.
[02:46:08.220 --> 02:46:11.020]   The idea that you can't create the kind of government
[02:46:11.020 --> 02:46:12.740]   Ayn Rand talked about, I talk about,
[02:46:12.740 --> 02:46:16.020]   that it's never been before means it'll never happen again.
[02:46:16.020 --> 02:46:17.020]   That's a silly argument.
[02:46:17.020 --> 02:46:19.260]   - It's not a silly argument, it's you're being a Platonist.
[02:46:19.260 --> 02:46:20.100]   - No, not at all.
[02:46:20.100 --> 02:46:22.340]   - I'll explain to you how you're being exactly a Platonist.
[02:46:22.340 --> 02:46:25.660]   So if I was sitting in 1750, arguing with Thomas Jefferson,
[02:46:25.660 --> 02:46:28.220]   he was telling me what kind of state he was gonna create,
[02:46:28.220 --> 02:46:30.460]   and I said, "Has a state like this ever been created?"
[02:46:30.460 --> 02:46:32.300]   And he said, "No, was I being a Platonist?"
[02:46:32.300 --> 02:46:33.140]   Of course not.
[02:46:33.140 --> 02:46:34.260]   - No, you're being a Platonist. - You know, things change.
[02:46:34.260 --> 02:46:35.420]   - You're being a Platonist now.
[02:46:35.420 --> 02:46:37.260]   Here's why you're being a Platonist now.
[02:46:37.260 --> 02:46:40.680]   Because one of the things that Aristotle believed in,
[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:42.620]   one of the things that Ayn Rand in other contexts
[02:46:42.620 --> 02:46:44.820]   believed in, the cover of her book,
[02:46:44.820 --> 02:46:47.980]   "The Philosophy Who Needs It," is,
[02:46:47.980 --> 02:46:49.900]   I think it's the Sistine Chapel, the cover,
[02:46:49.900 --> 02:46:50.740]   or wherever it is.
[02:46:50.740 --> 02:46:52.740]   Aristotle and Plato walking.
[02:46:52.740 --> 02:46:54.260]   - No, it's not, yeah, but--
[02:46:54.260 --> 02:46:55.100]   - What's that painting?
[02:46:55.100 --> 02:46:55.920]   I forget what it is.
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:46:56.760]   - It's the School of Athens.
[02:46:56.760 --> 02:46:57.700]   - School of Athens, thank you.
[02:46:57.700 --> 02:46:58.540]   - It's the Raphael.
[02:46:58.540 --> 02:47:01.580]   - So Plato's pointing toward the heavens
[02:47:01.580 --> 02:47:02.940]   while they're talking,
[02:47:02.940 --> 02:47:04.660]   and Aristotle's pointing to the earth.
[02:47:04.660 --> 02:47:05.780]   - Reality. - Reality.
[02:47:05.780 --> 02:47:06.620]   - Absolutely.
[02:47:06.620 --> 02:47:09.100]   - So if you want, there's two approaches.
[02:47:09.100 --> 02:47:12.040]   There's the Descartes, Cartesian approach,
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:16.240]   which is I sit in my armchair and I deduce all of reality.
[02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:18.940]   Or if I wanna study the nature of man,
[02:47:18.940 --> 02:47:20.380]   if I wanna study the nature of dogs,
[02:47:20.380 --> 02:47:21.860]   if I wanna study the nature of the sun,
[02:47:21.860 --> 02:47:23.300]   I have to look around.
[02:47:23.300 --> 02:47:26.120]   I have to open my eyes, I have to look at data.
[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:27.420]   It's very difficult.
[02:47:27.420 --> 02:47:29.620]   You know, when Rand was on Donahue,
[02:47:29.620 --> 02:47:30.540]   he asked her about,
[02:47:30.540 --> 02:47:33.040]   "Aren't you impressed with the order in the universe?"
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:35.820]   And she goes, "Oh, now you have to give me a moment."
[02:47:35.820 --> 02:47:36.900]   And the point she made,
[02:47:36.900 --> 02:47:39.020]   which was very hard for many people to grasp,
[02:47:39.020 --> 02:47:40.320]   it's hard for me to grasp,
[02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:45.040]   is one's concept of order comes from the universe.
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:47.460]   You can't have a disorderly universe
[02:47:47.460 --> 02:47:50.940]   'cause order means describing that which exists
[02:47:50.940 --> 02:47:52.140]   and which has existed.
[02:47:52.140 --> 02:47:56.740]   Now, if you are looking at governments throughout history
[02:47:56.740 --> 02:47:58.400]   that have always existed,
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:48:00.500]   and when you were on Lex, you said,
[02:48:00.500 --> 02:48:03.900]   "What I'm talking about has never existed."
[02:48:03.900 --> 02:48:04.740]   - That's right.
[02:48:04.740 --> 02:48:06.380]   - To say that this, therefore,
[02:48:06.380 --> 02:48:10.200]   that that has a possibility of working in reality,
[02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:13.380]   I think is certainly not a point in that favor, number one.
[02:48:13.380 --> 02:48:16.260]   And number two, Jefferson was a fraud.
[02:48:16.260 --> 02:48:19.300]   What Jefferson argued how America would look
[02:48:19.300 --> 02:48:20.800]   did not come true.
[02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:24.740]   Jefferson's concerns about the Constitution were accurate.
[02:48:24.740 --> 02:48:26.660]   And the fact is the federal government
[02:48:26.660 --> 02:48:29.820]   did become centralized, did become a civil war.
[02:48:29.820 --> 02:48:31.940]   So if you told Mr. Jefferson,
[02:48:31.940 --> 02:48:34.140]   "The government you're positing can't work,"
[02:48:34.140 --> 02:48:35.540]   you would have been correct.
[02:48:35.540 --> 02:48:37.540]   - That's not what I'm saying.
[02:48:37.540 --> 02:48:39.660]   It's not the issue of can it work or not.
[02:48:39.660 --> 02:48:42.020]   It's the issue of can something exist
[02:48:42.020 --> 02:48:43.620]   that hasn't existed in the past?
[02:48:43.620 --> 02:48:46.260]   It's a silly argument.
[02:48:46.260 --> 02:48:48.020]   Now, we can argue about the facts of reality
[02:48:48.020 --> 02:48:50.020]   whether such a thing can exist,
[02:48:50.020 --> 02:48:52.020]   but to say it hasn't existed in the past
[02:48:52.020 --> 02:48:54.820]   is not an argument about whether it can exist in the future.
[02:48:54.820 --> 02:48:55.980]   But that's the argument you made.
[02:48:55.980 --> 02:48:57.100]   - No, no, you're talking about history
[02:48:57.100 --> 02:48:58.340]   and now you're dancing around it.
[02:48:58.340 --> 02:48:59.180]   - No, I'm not.
[02:48:59.180 --> 02:49:00.000]   - Yes, you are.
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:03.020]   - I'm saying that something different happened
[02:49:03.020 --> 02:49:03.980]   in the founding of America.
[02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:05.260]   It might not have been perfect.
[02:49:05.260 --> 02:49:06.260]   Might not have been ideal.
[02:49:06.260 --> 02:49:08.260]   It might have been some people even think it was bad.
[02:49:08.260 --> 02:49:09.100]   - Sure, it was different.
[02:49:09.100 --> 02:49:10.540]   - If something different happened,
[02:49:10.540 --> 02:49:12.780]   and you could have sat 20 years before and said,
[02:49:12.780 --> 02:49:14.060]   "Well, that's never happened before,
[02:49:14.060 --> 02:49:15.660]   "so it can't happen in the future."
[02:49:15.660 --> 02:49:17.700]   That is a bad argument.
[02:49:17.700 --> 02:49:19.140]   That's not a good argument.
[02:49:19.140 --> 02:49:20.340]   Irrelevant.
[02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:21.740]   - No, but you're making the argument
[02:49:21.740 --> 02:49:24.340]   that just because something hasn't happened before,
[02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:26.660]   that's certainly not a point to say it's likely to happen
[02:49:26.660 --> 02:49:27.820]   or possible.
[02:49:27.820 --> 02:49:30.700]   - No, I'm saying, first of all,
[02:49:30.700 --> 02:49:34.100]   I agree that everything we know about what's possible
[02:49:34.100 --> 02:49:36.540]   or what's not possible has to be from reality.
[02:49:36.540 --> 02:49:37.780]   That we agree completely.
[02:49:37.780 --> 02:49:40.620]   I think anarchists completely evade that point.
[02:49:40.620 --> 02:49:45.260]   I think you guys live in a world of mythology,
[02:49:45.260 --> 02:49:47.420]   of abstraction, of Descartes,
[02:49:47.420 --> 02:49:49.620]   to imagine the kind of anarchy
[02:49:49.620 --> 02:49:52.420]   that David Friedman or Rothbard describe.
[02:49:52.420 --> 02:49:56.740]   It's complete fiction, and it's complete mysticism.
[02:49:56.740 --> 02:49:59.180]   - Okay, let me ask just a few dumb questions.
[02:49:59.180 --> 02:50:02.780]   So first of all, what do we do with violence
[02:50:02.780 --> 02:50:06.460]   in terms of just natural emergence of violence
[02:50:06.460 --> 02:50:07.580]   in human societies?
[02:50:07.580 --> 02:50:08.420]   - Sure.
[02:50:08.420 --> 02:50:12.300]   So the idea that anarchism proposes
[02:50:12.300 --> 02:50:15.300]   is that we would, as the community grows,
[02:50:15.300 --> 02:50:16.380]   there may be violence,
[02:50:16.380 --> 02:50:19.100]   and then we together form collectives
[02:50:19.100 --> 02:50:22.340]   that sort of fund mechanisms that resist that violence.
[02:50:22.340 --> 02:50:25.660]   I'd love to sort of talk about violence
[02:50:25.660 --> 02:50:28.620]   because that seems to be the core thing.
[02:50:28.620 --> 02:50:30.540]   That's the difference between the state
[02:50:30.540 --> 02:50:33.460]   that has a, was definitionally, I guess,
[02:50:33.460 --> 02:50:36.140]   is the thing that has a monopoly on violence
[02:50:36.140 --> 02:50:39.060]   or controls violence in such a way
[02:50:39.060 --> 02:50:40.300]   that you don't have to worry about it.
[02:50:40.300 --> 02:50:42.300]   And then the anarchism, I don't know.
[02:50:42.300 --> 02:50:43.660]   - I know, I'm just laughing 'cause--
[02:50:43.660 --> 02:50:44.540]   - I'm using bad words.
[02:50:44.540 --> 02:50:45.860]   - No, your definition is accurate,
[02:50:45.860 --> 02:50:49.380]   but the point is that being the definition of the state
[02:50:49.380 --> 02:50:52.460]   versus how states act in reality is just absurd, yeah.
[02:50:52.460 --> 02:50:55.860]   - So, and then the idea that anarchism would be
[02:50:55.860 --> 02:50:58.580]   is that it's more kind of a market
[02:50:58.580 --> 02:51:01.340]   of defenses against violence.
[02:51:01.340 --> 02:51:03.740]   So you have like security companies,
[02:51:03.740 --> 02:51:05.060]   and then you hire different ones
[02:51:05.060 --> 02:51:06.420]   that are more competent.
[02:51:06.420 --> 02:51:09.060]   - You have things being made affordable.
[02:51:09.060 --> 02:51:11.740]   You have more accessibility to security.
[02:51:11.740 --> 02:51:14.940]   You have accountability when people misuse their power,
[02:51:14.940 --> 02:51:19.100]   and you have more layers of security
[02:51:19.100 --> 02:51:20.380]   than having a government monopoly.
[02:51:20.380 --> 02:51:23.620]   What's that, every, objectivists understand,
[02:51:23.620 --> 02:51:24.660]   and they don't deny this.
[02:51:24.660 --> 02:51:26.460]   This is something they talk about constantly,
[02:51:26.460 --> 02:51:29.340]   is anytime you have a government monopoly,
[02:51:29.340 --> 02:51:32.820]   it's going to have enormous distortions as a consequence.
[02:51:32.820 --> 02:51:34.140]   It's going to be expensive.
[02:51:34.140 --> 02:51:35.460]   It's going to be ineffective.
[02:51:35.460 --> 02:51:38.100]   And when you're talking about ineffectiveness in markets,
[02:51:38.100 --> 02:51:40.300]   that's not just like the cup sucks.
[02:51:40.300 --> 02:51:42.140]   It often means mass death.
[02:51:42.140 --> 02:51:44.020]   It often means persecution.
[02:51:44.020 --> 02:51:47.300]   So this is something that anarchism,
[02:51:47.300 --> 02:51:50.740]   if not entirely prevents, certainly mitigates enormously.
[02:51:50.740 --> 02:51:52.700]   - So can I just, as a thought experiment,
[02:51:52.700 --> 02:51:55.300]   say it was very easy to immigrate to another country,
[02:51:55.300 --> 02:51:57.020]   like where you could just move about
[02:51:57.020 --> 02:51:59.100]   from government to government.
[02:51:59.100 --> 02:52:00.980]   Would that alleviate most of the problems
[02:52:00.980 --> 02:52:02.740]   that you have towards the state,
[02:52:02.740 --> 02:52:05.380]   which is like people being free to choose
[02:52:05.380 --> 02:52:07.460]   which government they operate under?
[02:52:07.460 --> 02:52:08.300]   Wouldn't that essentially become--
[02:52:08.300 --> 02:52:09.700]   - Ask him, yeah.
[02:52:09.700 --> 02:52:12.380]   - So like, what is, I'm trying to understand
[02:52:12.380 --> 02:52:16.460]   why governments aren't already the thing
[02:52:16.460 --> 02:52:18.260]   that's the goal of anarchism.
[02:52:18.260 --> 02:52:21.620]   The kind of collectives that emerge under anarchism
[02:52:21.620 --> 02:52:23.020]   seems to be what government--
[02:52:23.020 --> 02:52:24.460]   - You're equating two terms.
[02:52:24.460 --> 02:52:26.980]   So there's something called like private governance,
[02:52:26.980 --> 02:52:28.140]   and there's government.
[02:52:28.140 --> 02:52:32.180]   So for example, if I go to Yaron's house,
[02:52:32.180 --> 02:52:35.340]   and he has a rule, take off your shoes, become your house.
[02:52:35.340 --> 02:52:38.340]   If you wanna really be kind of silly about it,
[02:52:38.340 --> 02:52:40.220]   you could say he's the governor.
[02:52:40.220 --> 02:52:43.220]   But it's really nonsensical to say that.
[02:52:43.220 --> 02:52:44.900]   If you go to Macy's, right?
[02:52:44.900 --> 02:52:46.660]   If you wanna return your sweater,
[02:52:46.660 --> 02:52:49.300]   Macy's rules are right up there.
[02:52:49.300 --> 02:52:50.700]   You have seven days.
[02:52:50.700 --> 02:52:51.580]   If you don't have a receipt,
[02:52:51.580 --> 02:52:52.540]   you're gonna get store credit.
[02:52:52.540 --> 02:52:54.260]   If you do have a receipt, you get a refund.
[02:52:54.260 --> 02:52:57.660]   So every organization, every bar, every nightclub,
[02:52:57.660 --> 02:53:00.020]   your house has rules of governments.
[02:53:00.020 --> 02:53:01.820]   This is, it's often they're unspoken.
[02:53:01.820 --> 02:53:02.900]   This is unavoidable.
[02:53:02.900 --> 02:53:07.900]   No one in America by law has to pay a tip,
[02:53:07.900 --> 02:53:09.300]   but it's just customary.
[02:53:09.300 --> 02:53:11.620]   You go at the waiter, you give him 15, 20%,
[02:53:11.620 --> 02:53:12.980]   so on and so forth.
[02:53:12.980 --> 02:53:16.460]   Now, what anarchism does is it says,
[02:53:16.460 --> 02:53:20.620]   okay, security is something that is of crucial,
[02:53:20.620 --> 02:53:22.580]   essential human need.
[02:53:22.580 --> 02:53:24.700]   We all need to be safe in our property,
[02:53:24.700 --> 02:53:26.260]   safe in our purpose.
[02:53:26.260 --> 02:53:30.660]   The organization that by far is the biggest violator of this
[02:53:30.660 --> 02:53:33.220]   and always has been, always will be is the government.
[02:53:33.220 --> 02:53:34.060]   Why?
[02:53:34.060 --> 02:53:36.860]   'Cause it's a monopoly, 'cause it has no accountability.
[02:53:36.860 --> 02:53:40.220]   And look at the rioting last year, right?
[02:53:40.220 --> 02:53:42.060]   If you have one agency,
[02:53:42.060 --> 02:53:44.380]   pretend it's not the government, pretend it's Apple.
[02:53:44.380 --> 02:53:47.460]   And Apple has the, in charge of security in this town.
[02:53:47.460 --> 02:53:49.620]   People are rioting, people are looting.
[02:53:49.620 --> 02:53:50.580]   And Apple says,
[02:53:50.580 --> 02:53:52.460]   "Yeah, we're not gonna send people into work.
[02:53:52.460 --> 02:53:54.380]   "And if you try to defend yourself,
[02:53:54.380 --> 02:53:56.060]   "we're gonna put you in jail as well."
[02:53:56.060 --> 02:53:58.780]   That's the problem of having a government monopoly.
[02:53:58.780 --> 02:54:00.860]   And that's something that anarchism solves for.
[02:54:00.860 --> 02:54:01.700]   - So, okay.
[02:54:01.700 --> 02:54:05.060]   But don't you, 'cause you said no accountability.
[02:54:05.060 --> 02:54:07.420]   Don't you mean to say poor accountability?
[02:54:07.420 --> 02:54:09.420]   - No, I mean to say no accountability.
[02:54:09.420 --> 02:54:11.700]   - But isn't that the idea of democracies?
[02:54:11.700 --> 02:54:12.940]   - I'm not for democracy.
[02:54:12.940 --> 02:54:14.020]   - No, not for democracy,
[02:54:14.020 --> 02:54:17.100]   but like the system of governments that we have,
[02:54:17.100 --> 02:54:19.820]   there is a monopoly on violence,
[02:54:19.820 --> 02:54:23.060]   but there is a, I mean, at least in the ideal,
[02:54:23.060 --> 02:54:25.820]   but I think in practice as well, there's an accountability.
[02:54:25.820 --> 02:54:26.660]   - I do not think that's--
[02:54:26.660 --> 02:54:27.900]   - I know you're a critic of the police force
[02:54:27.900 --> 02:54:28.820]   and all those kinds of things,
[02:54:28.820 --> 02:54:31.660]   but the military is accountable to the people.
[02:54:31.660 --> 02:54:32.500]   - I do not agree.
[02:54:32.500 --> 02:54:34.900]   - The police force is accountable to the people.
[02:54:34.900 --> 02:54:37.780]   Perhaps imperfectly, but you're saying not at all.
[02:54:37.780 --> 02:54:38.620]   - Not at all.
[02:54:38.620 --> 02:54:41.500]   And we've seen many examples of police officers
[02:54:41.500 --> 02:54:43.900]   doing horrific things on video
[02:54:43.900 --> 02:54:44.740]   and they don't even lose their pension.
[02:54:44.740 --> 02:54:47.780]   - But there's a lot of amazing police officers, no?
[02:54:47.780 --> 02:54:49.780]   - I mean, no, there are not.
[02:54:49.780 --> 02:54:51.660]   - So you're saying by nature,
[02:54:51.660 --> 02:54:53.780]   police is like a fundamentally flawed system.
[02:54:53.780 --> 02:54:56.100]   - No, by nature, government monopoly on police
[02:54:56.100 --> 02:54:58.940]   is a fundamentally irredeemable system.
[02:54:58.940 --> 02:55:00.940]   We'll talk about private security.
[02:55:00.940 --> 02:55:03.260]   If I have a private security firm,
[02:55:03.260 --> 02:55:05.140]   you could have that under a government,
[02:55:05.140 --> 02:55:07.700]   and as a result of my private security,
[02:55:07.700 --> 02:55:10.660]   my person who I'm bodyguarding gets shot,
[02:55:10.660 --> 02:55:12.940]   that's going to be very bad for my company
[02:55:12.940 --> 02:55:15.060]   as compared to competing companies.
[02:55:15.060 --> 02:55:16.820]   However, when you have a government monopoly
[02:55:16.820 --> 02:55:19.220]   and I get people shot, what are you going to do?
[02:55:19.220 --> 02:55:23.660]   - So the problem is that all the examples
[02:55:23.660 --> 02:55:25.860]   are going to be within the context of an existing government.
[02:55:25.860 --> 02:55:27.460]   This is why I said the cell phone example
[02:55:27.460 --> 02:55:29.260]   and all these other examples of us being here.
[02:55:29.260 --> 02:55:31.180]   We're not in anarchy, that is absurd.
[02:55:31.180 --> 02:55:33.060]   We're under a particular system of law
[02:55:33.060 --> 02:55:34.300]   and the system of laws applies
[02:55:34.300 --> 02:55:37.780]   and we know that this particular system of laws applies.
[02:55:37.780 --> 02:55:40.300]   So the problem is when you have--
[02:55:40.300 --> 02:55:43.180]   - There are many laws that we're not going to be enforced.
[02:55:43.180 --> 02:55:44.420]   That we're not-- - Sure, we know that.
[02:55:44.420 --> 02:55:46.660]   - Violence related? - No, there are lots of laws
[02:55:46.660 --> 02:55:47.820]   that are not going to be enforced.
[02:55:47.820 --> 02:55:52.820]   Right, and that doesn't make this anarchy
[02:55:52.820 --> 02:55:54.300]   because there are other laws out there.
[02:55:54.300 --> 02:55:57.180]   They could be enforced, which makes it an enormous risk.
[02:55:57.180 --> 02:55:59.980]   But look, there's a number of issues here.
[02:55:59.980 --> 02:56:03.420]   There's an issue of the role of force in human society.
[02:56:03.420 --> 02:56:04.260]   - I got to clarify a thing
[02:56:04.260 --> 02:56:06.620]   'cause I think you misunderstood what I said.
[02:56:06.620 --> 02:56:08.860]   I'm not saying that America is anarchist.
[02:56:08.860 --> 02:56:10.140]   What I'm saying is the three of us
[02:56:10.140 --> 02:56:11.740]   have an anarchist relationship between us
[02:56:11.740 --> 02:56:13.500]   because none of us have authority over the others.
[02:56:13.500 --> 02:56:14.340]   That's what I'm saying.
[02:56:14.340 --> 02:56:16.740]   - But that's a bad use of the word anarchy.
[02:56:16.740 --> 02:56:18.380]   - No, that's the correct use of the word anarchy.
[02:56:18.380 --> 02:56:19.260]   - It makes it meaningless.
[02:56:19.260 --> 02:56:21.860]   It makes it, every time any people get together,
[02:56:21.860 --> 02:56:23.580]   they have an anarchistic relationship.
[02:56:23.580 --> 02:56:24.540]   - Yes. - No, we have
[02:56:24.540 --> 02:56:25.740]   a voluntary relationship.
[02:56:25.740 --> 02:56:27.500]   - That's what anarchism means, voluntarism.
[02:56:27.500 --> 02:56:28.340]   - No, it doesn't.
[02:56:28.340 --> 02:56:30.860]   It's a political system. - You wanna get a dictionary out?
[02:56:30.860 --> 02:56:33.780]   - You're taking a word and it's accepted usage,
[02:56:33.780 --> 02:56:35.780]   and then you're saying, oh no, it means--
[02:56:35.780 --> 02:56:36.940]   - You mean like selfishness?
[02:56:36.940 --> 02:56:39.140]   - Maybe, and we never finished that discussion.
[02:56:39.140 --> 02:56:40.980]   You're taking a word, we're taking a word
[02:56:40.980 --> 02:56:45.220]   that you're defining as, and replacing it with voluntary.
[02:56:45.220 --> 02:56:46.060]   Now, voluntary-- - Okay, fine,
[02:56:46.060 --> 02:56:47.500]   I'm not for anarchism or voluntarism.
[02:56:47.500 --> 02:56:48.780]   Fine, go ahead. - But let me,
[02:56:48.780 --> 02:56:51.220]   let's understand what voluntary means, right?
[02:56:51.220 --> 02:56:52.980]   So we, for example, go into stores
[02:56:52.980 --> 02:56:54.500]   and there's a certain relationship
[02:56:54.500 --> 02:56:56.380]   that we have with the store that we engage
[02:56:56.380 --> 02:56:58.820]   in certain voluntary transactions with that store.
[02:56:58.820 --> 02:57:00.980]   Now, I believe that that works
[02:57:00.980 --> 02:57:04.060]   because there is a certain system of law
[02:57:04.060 --> 02:57:06.900]   that both the store and we have accepted
[02:57:06.900 --> 02:57:08.740]   that makes that possible.
[02:57:08.740 --> 02:57:11.660]   Now, if that didn't, there are certain people
[02:57:11.660 --> 02:57:12.740]   who would like to walk into the store
[02:57:12.740 --> 02:57:14.500]   and just take the stuff, right?
[02:57:14.500 --> 02:57:17.020]   So there is a, not, we might not,
[02:57:17.020 --> 02:57:17.860]   but there are certain people
[02:57:17.860 --> 02:57:19.180]   who might want it to go into their store.
[02:57:19.180 --> 02:57:20.460]   There's a certain system of laws
[02:57:20.460 --> 02:57:23.540]   that regulates the relationship
[02:57:23.540 --> 02:57:26.300]   and that defines the property rights
[02:57:26.300 --> 02:57:28.740]   and then provides protection for the property rights.
[02:57:28.740 --> 02:57:30.620]   Now, you would like all that privatized.
[02:57:30.620 --> 02:57:32.700]   That is, the store would have its police force
[02:57:32.700 --> 02:57:34.020]   and that would be privatized.
[02:57:34.020 --> 02:57:36.620]   Now, I don't believe that force can be privatized.
[02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:41.100]   And there are many reasons-- - And it shouldn't.
[02:57:41.100 --> 02:57:42.580]   - I don't think it can.
[02:57:42.580 --> 02:57:45.060]   And I don't think, I think it's a--
[02:57:45.060 --> 02:57:46.660]   - That's an interesting distinction.
[02:57:46.660 --> 02:57:48.620]   - I don't think it can because I think
[02:57:48.620 --> 02:57:50.540]   that it's an unstable equilibrium, right?
[02:57:50.540 --> 02:57:54.380]   I don't think competing police forces can work.
[02:57:54.380 --> 02:57:57.900]   At the end, the police force with the biggest gun
[02:57:57.900 --> 02:57:59.540]   always wins and always takes over--
[02:57:59.540 --> 02:58:01.260]   - That's not true. - And becomes authoritarian.
[02:58:01.260 --> 02:58:03.500]   - Look at Iran and Iraq, excuse me.
[02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:06.260]   We had the bigger guns, we didn't win.
[02:58:06.260 --> 02:58:07.420]   Look at Afghanistan.
[02:58:07.420 --> 02:58:10.840]   - We didn't, we didn't win partially
[02:58:10.840 --> 02:58:13.260]   because none of that is an example of anarchy.
[02:58:13.260 --> 02:58:14.260]   - No, but you said, you just said
[02:58:14.260 --> 02:58:15.660]   the guy with the biggest gun is gonna win.
[02:58:15.660 --> 02:58:16.580]   - Yeah, the guy with the biggest gun--
[02:58:16.580 --> 02:58:18.180]   - We didn't win in Vietnam.
[02:58:18.180 --> 02:58:20.140]   We had the bigger guns.
[02:58:20.140 --> 02:58:22.140]   - But again, you're taking it outside of a context.
[02:58:22.140 --> 02:58:24.220]   That was a context in which,
[02:58:24.220 --> 02:58:25.900]   that was a context in which countries are fighting,
[02:58:25.900 --> 02:58:28.300]   not a context in which there is no country.
[02:58:28.300 --> 02:58:30.900]   - Okay, let's suppose you, Yaron, have a rocket launcher.
[02:58:30.900 --> 02:58:32.260]   - Yes. - And there's 100 people
[02:58:32.260 --> 02:58:34.180]   with handguns, how are you gonna win?
[02:58:34.180 --> 02:58:35.940]   You have the biggest gun.
[02:58:35.940 --> 02:58:37.620]   - Oh, believe me, I could win.
[02:58:37.620 --> 02:58:39.260]   - With one rocket launcher against 100 people?
[02:58:39.260 --> 02:58:41.580]   - Yeah, it's just, well, it depends how many rockets
[02:58:41.580 --> 02:58:42.420]   I have in the rocket launcher
[02:58:42.420 --> 02:58:43.980]   and whether I'm willing to use them.
[02:58:43.980 --> 02:58:46.300]   But that's, but so now it's democracy
[02:58:46.300 --> 02:58:48.300]   because there are more of them that they win.
[02:58:48.300 --> 02:58:52.980]   Look, any one of these scenarios, all it does,
[02:58:52.980 --> 02:58:54.980]   so let's go back to the store, so--
[02:58:54.980 --> 02:58:56.100]   - This is fascinating, by the way.
[02:58:56.100 --> 02:58:57.180]   I'm really enjoying this.
[02:58:57.180 --> 02:58:58.140]   I just wanna say that.
[02:58:58.140 --> 02:58:58.980]   This is great.
[02:58:58.980 --> 02:59:00.780]   (laughing)
[02:59:00.780 --> 02:59:01.980]   Because-- - I'm glad you are.
[02:59:01.980 --> 02:59:03.540]   I am enjoying the pain.
[02:59:03.540 --> 02:59:04.860]   - And I'm also enjoying the comments
[02:59:04.860 --> 02:59:06.420]   that are gonna happen.
[02:59:06.420 --> 02:59:08.060]   - Oh, the comments, the comments are gonna be
[02:59:08.060 --> 02:59:09.500]   overwhelmingly on your side.
[02:59:09.500 --> 02:59:10.340]   I know that. - I don't think so.
[02:59:10.340 --> 02:59:11.340]   - Because people like honesty. - I don't think so.
[02:59:11.340 --> 02:59:12.180]   - No.
[02:59:12.180 --> 02:59:13.940]   - So I think the anarchy position is completely dishonest.
[02:59:13.940 --> 02:59:15.780]   - I'm a modern day, what's his name?
[02:59:15.780 --> 02:59:17.940]   What's the guy who was defending communism?
[02:59:17.940 --> 02:59:18.860]   - Oh, Richard Wolff.
[02:59:18.860 --> 02:59:20.220]   - I'm a modern day Richard Wolff.
[02:59:20.220 --> 02:59:21.420]   (laughing)
[02:59:21.420 --> 02:59:23.580]   - There's a sense in which I think anarchists
[02:59:23.580 --> 02:59:26.980]   are evading reality in the same sense.
[02:59:26.980 --> 02:59:28.420]   You know, so we've got this--
[02:59:28.420 --> 02:59:31.060]   - Do you think I'm dishonest or delusional?
[02:59:31.060 --> 02:59:31.900]   - I think you--
[02:59:31.900 --> 02:59:34.980]   - Calling someone dishonest is a really specific--
[02:59:34.980 --> 02:59:35.820]   - That's true.
[02:59:35.820 --> 02:59:36.900]   - I think you're delusional.
[02:59:36.900 --> 02:59:37.860]   - I think you're delusional
[02:59:37.860 --> 02:59:39.380]   and I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt
[02:59:39.380 --> 02:59:40.220]   of being delusional.
[02:59:40.220 --> 02:59:41.060]   - Okay, good.
[02:59:41.060 --> 02:59:44.140]   - And we all love each other. - That's fair.
[02:59:44.140 --> 02:59:46.300]   - And as I said-- - Life is long.
[02:59:46.300 --> 02:59:50.140]   - And as I said on the show, on the previous interview,
[02:59:50.140 --> 02:59:52.580]   I said only smart people can be anarchists
[02:59:52.580 --> 02:59:54.660]   because it requires a certain level of abstraction
[02:59:54.660 --> 02:59:58.060]   of being divorced from reality that is hard
[02:59:58.060 --> 02:59:59.780]   for people who are actually connected to reality.
[02:59:59.780 --> 03:00:01.660]   - He makes a good point 'cause I always talk about this
[03:00:01.660 --> 03:00:03.900]   with people on social media and they talk about
[03:00:03.900 --> 03:00:07.020]   a lot of people who buy into the corporate media narrative
[03:00:07.020 --> 03:00:07.860]   and how they're dumb.
[03:00:07.860 --> 03:00:10.620]   I go, it's easier to train smart people than dumb people.
[03:00:10.620 --> 03:00:13.060]   It's easier to convince smart people of the systemic
[03:00:13.060 --> 03:00:14.540]   that's divorced from reality than somebody's dumb.
[03:00:14.540 --> 03:00:15.380]   - They can deal in abstractions.
[03:00:15.380 --> 03:00:17.140]   They don't have to deal with the concretes
[03:00:17.140 --> 03:00:18.180]   that actually happen.
[03:00:18.180 --> 03:00:23.860]   This is an example I gave debating another anarchist.
[03:00:23.860 --> 03:00:25.180]   - Who was it?
[03:00:25.180 --> 03:00:26.220]   She must have sucked.
[03:00:26.220 --> 03:00:28.380]   Well, you were the best.
[03:00:28.380 --> 03:00:29.580]   - They were Hoppe fans.
[03:00:29.580 --> 03:00:30.420]   - Oh, okay, Hoppe.
[03:00:30.420 --> 03:00:33.380]   - Hoppe fans, not one of my least liked,
[03:00:33.380 --> 03:00:36.380]   the people I liked the least in the world out there.
[03:00:36.380 --> 03:00:40.860]   - You like them better than the communists, don't you?
[03:00:40.860 --> 03:00:41.780]   - Barely.
[03:00:41.780 --> 03:00:43.020]   - Oh, come on, seriously?
[03:00:43.020 --> 03:00:44.420]   - Yes, 'cause I think it leads to the same place.
[03:00:44.420 --> 03:00:45.260]   I really do.
[03:00:45.260 --> 03:00:46.100]   I think it leads to gulags.
[03:00:46.100 --> 03:00:46.940]   - Fine.
[03:00:46.940 --> 03:00:47.780]   - I think anarchy leads to gulags.
[03:00:47.780 --> 03:00:49.340]   And I think Hoppe's view of anarchy
[03:00:49.340 --> 03:00:50.260]   definitely leads to gulags.
[03:00:50.260 --> 03:00:52.020]   - I'll grant you just for the sake of argument
[03:00:52.020 --> 03:00:52.980]   that it leads to gulags.
[03:00:52.980 --> 03:00:57.460]   However, surely you concede that they are against gulags
[03:00:57.460 --> 03:00:58.980]   whereas the communists have no problem with it.
[03:00:58.980 --> 03:01:00.060]   And that's a big--
[03:01:00.060 --> 03:01:00.980]   - I think some do.
[03:01:00.980 --> 03:01:03.100]   I'm not sure people like Hoppe do
[03:01:03.100 --> 03:01:06.660]   because if you read some of his stuff, one wonders.
[03:01:06.660 --> 03:01:10.380]   But once monarchies and he once--
[03:01:10.380 --> 03:01:12.340]   - No, he said monarchy is a preferable to democracy,
[03:01:12.340 --> 03:01:13.180]   which is true.
[03:01:13.180 --> 03:01:14.020]   - No, it's not.
[03:01:14.020 --> 03:01:15.220]   Oh, God.
[03:01:15.220 --> 03:01:17.100]   I mean, one of the problems with anarchists is--
[03:01:17.100 --> 03:01:18.700]   - One judge, that's the monarch.
[03:01:18.700 --> 03:01:20.980]   - One of the problems, yeah.
[03:01:20.980 --> 03:01:22.540]   One judge, one authority.
[03:01:22.540 --> 03:01:23.540]   This is why I think-- - The monarch.
[03:01:23.540 --> 03:01:24.580]   - That's why I think--
[03:01:24.580 --> 03:01:26.540]   - So you're Hoppean.
[03:01:26.540 --> 03:01:27.380]   - Anarchists are Hoppeans.
[03:01:27.380 --> 03:01:28.860]   - So Yaron Brooks is Hoppean.
[03:01:28.860 --> 03:01:29.700]   - No, I'm not Hoppean. - Get in the chopper.
[03:01:29.700 --> 03:01:30.980]   - I don't want one judge.
[03:01:30.980 --> 03:01:33.180]   I don't want an arbitrary judge.
[03:01:33.180 --> 03:01:34.660]   I want an objective judge.
[03:01:34.660 --> 03:01:36.620]   - There's an essay by John Hasnas,
[03:01:36.620 --> 03:01:37.860]   I think his name, I'm gonna bungle it.
[03:01:37.860 --> 03:01:40.060]   It's gonna be in my upcoming book on anarchism.
[03:01:40.060 --> 03:01:41.340]   And he just discusses,
[03:01:41.340 --> 03:01:43.980]   and it's a very long, complicated technical issue,
[03:01:43.980 --> 03:01:47.420]   that the idea of objective law is incoherent.
[03:01:47.420 --> 03:01:50.020]   - Well, yeah, I mean, that's why we disagree so much.
[03:01:50.020 --> 03:01:53.140]   Because I think objective law is the only coherent system.
[03:01:53.140 --> 03:01:56.720]   - Do you disagree that we, in effect,
[03:01:56.720 --> 03:02:01.580]   have competing systems of law under America?
[03:02:01.580 --> 03:02:04.060]   Meaning there's different ideologies.
[03:02:04.060 --> 03:02:05.460]   You have the Sotomayor ideology
[03:02:05.460 --> 03:02:07.220]   versus the Scalia ideology.
[03:02:07.220 --> 03:02:09.580]   And that effectively, and the point being,
[03:02:09.580 --> 03:02:11.540]   when you and I file a lawsuit,
[03:02:11.540 --> 03:02:13.340]   it completely depends on who the judge is.
[03:02:13.340 --> 03:02:15.940]   - Yes, and in theory, in theory,
[03:02:15.940 --> 03:02:17.140]   I don't think the system works this way,
[03:02:17.140 --> 03:02:19.220]   but in theory, the way the system would work
[03:02:19.220 --> 03:02:23.220]   is that on new issues, there is some competition.
[03:02:23.220 --> 03:02:24.220]   - Hi, it's nice to meet you.
[03:02:24.220 --> 03:02:26.340]   - Siri, I wasn't talking to you.
[03:02:26.340 --> 03:02:27.540]   Technology.
[03:02:27.540 --> 03:02:28.860]   - Capitalism.
[03:02:28.860 --> 03:02:30.580]   - So in theory, the system works,
[03:02:30.580 --> 03:02:33.020]   and this works, I think, with competing states,
[03:02:33.020 --> 03:02:36.860]   but also with competing legal views,
[03:02:36.860 --> 03:02:38.340]   particularly on a new issue.
[03:02:38.340 --> 03:02:42.200]   There's some, this is how common law worked, right?
[03:02:42.200 --> 03:02:43.780]   There's some evolution of it,
[03:02:43.780 --> 03:02:46.740]   and at some point, that gets codified into the law,
[03:02:46.740 --> 03:02:48.460]   and it gets objectified in that sense.
[03:02:48.460 --> 03:02:51.620]   That is, there's some conclusion that people come to.
[03:02:51.620 --> 03:02:54.140]   This is the role, in theory, of a legislature,
[03:02:54.140 --> 03:02:55.340]   and the legislature would be nice
[03:02:55.340 --> 03:02:57.300]   if it was composed of people
[03:02:57.300 --> 03:03:00.300]   who had some idea of legal philosophy.
[03:03:00.300 --> 03:03:01.140]   - Sure.
[03:03:01.140 --> 03:03:02.700]   - And it gets codified.
[03:03:02.700 --> 03:03:04.860]   And when it, because these things are complex,
[03:03:04.860 --> 03:03:08.060]   and at some point, it goes through all the arguments,
[03:03:08.060 --> 03:03:10.020]   and then a certain truth emerges,
[03:03:10.020 --> 03:03:11.700]   or a certain truth is identified,
[03:03:11.700 --> 03:03:13.860]   and that's what gets encoded in law.
[03:03:13.860 --> 03:03:15.780]   That's what the purpose of a legislature is.
[03:03:15.780 --> 03:03:19.140]   Now, if you have competing mechanisms
[03:03:19.140 --> 03:03:21.720]   that don't converge on one authority,
[03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:23.060]   because there's no one authority,
[03:03:23.060 --> 03:03:24.380]   there are multiple authorities.
[03:03:24.380 --> 03:03:26.220]   That is, in a sense, there are multiple governments,
[03:03:26.220 --> 03:03:29.740]   or multiple systems of enforcement, right?
[03:03:29.740 --> 03:03:34.600]   Then you get not just something emerging out of it,
[03:03:34.600 --> 03:03:37.700]   what you get is competing legal systems.
[03:03:37.700 --> 03:03:40.340]   Competing legal systems that now have
[03:03:40.340 --> 03:03:43.620]   competing mechanisms of enforcement.
[03:03:43.620 --> 03:03:46.140]   Competing police forces, competing militaries,
[03:03:46.140 --> 03:03:47.880]   however we want to define it.
[03:03:47.880 --> 03:03:50.460]   And now there's no mechanism to resolve that.
[03:03:50.460 --> 03:03:53.060]   Now, yes, we could negotiate,
[03:03:53.060 --> 03:03:55.820]   and there's goodwill, and so on, right?
[03:03:55.820 --> 03:03:57.380]   - Yeah, there you go. - No, no.
[03:03:57.380 --> 03:03:59.900]   But now we're talking about the law,
[03:03:59.900 --> 03:04:04.900]   what each view, each position views as true and right.
[03:04:04.900 --> 03:04:08.480]   And it might involve, for example,
[03:04:08.480 --> 03:04:11.160]   it might involve the fact that the legal system
[03:04:11.160 --> 03:04:12.740]   has come to the conclusion that it's okay
[03:04:12.740 --> 03:04:15.000]   for children to have sex with adults,
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:18.120]   and this legal system thinks that is evil and wrong.
[03:04:18.120 --> 03:04:19.180]   - Sure. - Right?
[03:04:19.180 --> 03:04:23.840]   And something has happened between the two.
[03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:25.160]   How do you resolve that conflict?
[03:04:25.160 --> 03:04:26.600]   There is no resolution.
[03:04:26.600 --> 03:04:29.060]   If this adult wants to have sex with this child,
[03:04:29.060 --> 03:04:30.320]   this legal system thinks it's okay,
[03:04:30.320 --> 03:04:31.720]   that legal system thinks it.
[03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:33.400]   The only way to resolve that system
[03:04:33.400 --> 03:04:35.680]   is through one system imposing itself on the other.
[03:04:35.680 --> 03:04:37.560]   An example of countries is exactly that.
[03:04:37.560 --> 03:04:39.000]   When you had monarchies,
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.200]   when you had little states all over the place,
[03:04:41.200 --> 03:04:43.940]   the way any kind of dispute was resolved
[03:04:43.940 --> 03:04:46.160]   when there were issues of territorial disputes,
[03:04:46.160 --> 03:04:47.720]   or issues of marriage, or issues
[03:04:47.720 --> 03:04:51.440]   of different legal interpretations of how, was war.
[03:04:51.440 --> 03:04:52.280]   - No, it wasn't. - War, yes, it was.
[03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:53.440]   - It was marriage.
[03:04:53.440 --> 03:04:55.240]   A lot of times people would marry a princess
[03:04:55.240 --> 03:04:56.080]   from another country just to have peace.
[03:04:56.080 --> 03:04:58.800]   - Sure, forced marriages, which was not very pleasant.
[03:04:58.800 --> 03:05:00.980]   - I'd rather sacrifice one princess than a country.
[03:05:00.980 --> 03:05:02.860]   - No, I don't wanna sacrifice anybody.
[03:05:02.860 --> 03:05:03.700]   And in addition, I don't wanna sacrifice anybody.
[03:05:03.700 --> 03:05:05.360]   - I wanna sacrifice the royals.
[03:05:05.360 --> 03:05:07.500]   - And in addition, well, I don't want royals.
[03:05:07.500 --> 03:05:08.340]   - Well, that's what sacrificing means.
[03:05:08.340 --> 03:05:09.180]   - I think royals are pretty disgusting.
[03:05:09.180 --> 03:05:10.000]   - Okay, I agree.
[03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:13.100]   - And then on top of that,
[03:05:13.100 --> 03:05:15.940]   look, those periods in history are filled with violence,
[03:05:15.940 --> 03:05:18.020]   much more violence than we have today,
[03:05:18.020 --> 03:05:19.700]   much more bloody than they are today,
[03:05:19.700 --> 03:05:21.580]   far less freedom than we have today
[03:05:21.580 --> 03:05:22.420]   in terms of individual freedom.
[03:05:22.420 --> 03:05:24.380]   - You're comparing this to 20th century.
[03:05:26.400 --> 03:05:29.160]   - Yes, I'm comparing a monarchy, right?
[03:05:29.160 --> 03:05:33.400]   You said that's preferable to democracy, right?
[03:05:33.400 --> 03:05:34.240]   I'm comparing-
[03:05:34.240 --> 03:05:35.160]   - I'm saying Hoppe said that.
[03:05:35.160 --> 03:05:36.200]   I'm not saying I'm saying that.
[03:05:36.200 --> 03:05:37.040]   - Oh, I thought you agreed with that.
[03:05:37.040 --> 03:05:39.200]   - To some extent, but I'm not gonna die in that hell.
[03:05:39.200 --> 03:05:41.360]   - Hoppe said that, and I think it's ridiculous.
[03:05:41.360 --> 03:05:44.280]   These kings and queens were fighting constantly.
[03:05:44.280 --> 03:05:47.560]   I mean, the wars back then were violent in a way that-
[03:05:47.560 --> 03:05:48.400]   - Unlike now?
[03:05:48.400 --> 03:05:49.520]   - No, much more violent than now.
[03:05:49.520 --> 03:05:50.880]   If you look at the actual percentage
[03:05:50.880 --> 03:05:51.720]   of people killed in war-
[03:05:51.720 --> 03:05:52.560]   - Yeah, the Steven Pinker book.
[03:05:52.560 --> 03:05:53.960]   - Yeah, if you look at the percentage of people,
[03:05:53.960 --> 03:05:56.340]   and not just that, you can look at the other stats,
[03:05:56.340 --> 03:05:58.140]   that the percentage of people killed in war back then
[03:05:58.140 --> 03:05:59.580]   were far greater than the percentage of people
[03:05:59.580 --> 03:06:01.660]   even during World War II and World War I.
[03:06:01.660 --> 03:06:05.440]   So, anarchy, and David Fiedman loves to quote
[03:06:05.440 --> 03:06:08.460]   the sagas of Iceland about how wonderful the anarchy,
[03:06:08.460 --> 03:06:10.980]   and I mean, it's funny 'cause a lot of people
[03:06:10.980 --> 03:06:13.080]   who read David Fiedman never read the sagas.
[03:06:13.080 --> 03:06:14.380]   It's worth reading.
[03:06:14.380 --> 03:06:18.580]   The sagas of the Iceland are filled with violence,
[03:06:18.580 --> 03:06:21.820]   constant violence, constantly people killing each other
[03:06:21.820 --> 03:06:26.820]   over, "I stole your chickens and you slept with my wife."
[03:06:26.820 --> 03:06:28.580]   The only way to resolve disputes,
[03:06:28.580 --> 03:06:31.640]   the only way to resolve disputes was violence.
[03:06:31.640 --> 03:06:33.780]   There was no authority, there was no mechanism
[03:06:33.780 --> 03:06:35.020]   to resolve these disputes.
[03:06:35.020 --> 03:06:36.500]   There was a council, but the council
[03:06:36.500 --> 03:06:38.260]   couldn't enforce anything, so in the end of the day,
[03:06:38.260 --> 03:06:39.460]   we just resolved the violence.
[03:06:39.460 --> 03:06:44.460]   And this is legalized because there is no mechanism
[03:06:44.460 --> 03:06:46.580]   by which to make the violence illegal.
[03:06:46.580 --> 03:06:49.660]   So, all anarchy is is legalized violence,
[03:06:49.660 --> 03:06:54.660]   constrained up for a while,
[03:06:54.660 --> 03:06:58.940]   and up until people stop that constraint
[03:06:58.940 --> 03:07:03.940]   by arrangements between the security organizations.
[03:07:03.940 --> 03:07:06.300]   But the security organizations have us by the balls,
[03:07:06.300 --> 03:07:08.580]   to put it figuratively, right?
[03:07:08.580 --> 03:07:09.420]   They really do.
[03:07:09.420 --> 03:07:11.100]   - Sure, unlike the state?
[03:07:11.100 --> 03:07:13.020]   - Oh, the state today has it,
[03:07:13.020 --> 03:07:14.940]   but I would much rather live in this state,
[03:07:14.940 --> 03:07:16.300]   much rather live in this state,
[03:07:16.300 --> 03:07:18.780]   much rather live in many more authoritarian states
[03:07:18.780 --> 03:07:22.780]   than this, than a place where there's constant violence.
[03:07:22.780 --> 03:07:24.540]   - I have a bunch of questions, but I'm enjoying this.
[03:07:24.540 --> 03:07:25.780]   - Here's why everything he said is wrong.
[03:07:25.780 --> 03:07:26.620]   - Okay, yes.
[03:07:26.620 --> 03:07:29.500]   - First of all, the idea of competing legal systems
[03:07:29.500 --> 03:07:33.660]   is inevitable, because what Rand talked about
[03:07:33.660 --> 03:07:37.660]   is what she wanted was, and this is really kind of
[03:07:37.660 --> 03:07:41.020]   Eric out of character with her broader ideology is,
[03:07:41.020 --> 03:07:42.900]   I think this was her term, and I'm not saying this
[03:07:42.900 --> 03:07:45.500]   to make fun of you, when she has a judge
[03:07:45.500 --> 03:07:47.340]   and he's looking at the information,
[03:07:47.340 --> 03:07:49.220]   she wants him to be basically,
[03:07:49.220 --> 03:07:50.820]   I think she used the word robot,
[03:07:50.820 --> 03:07:52.540]   someone without any ideology,
[03:07:52.540 --> 03:07:54.060]   that they're just looking at the facts,
[03:07:54.060 --> 03:07:56.700]   they're not bringing their kind of worldview to it.
[03:07:56.700 --> 03:07:58.020]   - I take it as a compliment.
[03:07:58.020 --> 03:07:59.100]   - You are welcome.
[03:07:59.100 --> 03:08:06.140]   I think that given otherwise, her correct view
[03:08:06.140 --> 03:08:10.220]   that ideology, state-constituting ideology
[03:08:10.220 --> 03:08:13.020]   is just a slur for someone's philosophy,
[03:08:13.020 --> 03:08:15.420]   that someone, especially someone as erudite,
[03:08:15.420 --> 03:08:17.260]   educated and informed as a judge,
[03:08:17.260 --> 03:08:21.100]   has to, and in fact should, bring their ideology
[03:08:21.100 --> 03:08:23.740]   to their work is in one sense a little contradiction
[03:08:23.740 --> 03:08:25.100]   in her view, number one.
[03:08:25.100 --> 03:08:29.860]   Number two is, we have right now the DA in San Francisco,
[03:08:29.860 --> 03:08:32.860]   I forget his name, he's the son of literal terrorists,
[03:08:32.860 --> 03:08:36.260]   communist terrorists, and he has made it the decree,
[03:08:36.260 --> 03:08:39.620]   unilaterally, that if you shoplift for less than,
[03:08:39.620 --> 03:08:41.660]   I forget, $200, we're not prosecuting.
[03:08:41.660 --> 03:08:42.500]   - Yeah, I know that.
[03:08:42.500 --> 03:08:43.900]   - You know this guy, right, right, right.
[03:08:43.900 --> 03:08:48.820]   So now you and I, and Lex, I'm sure, probably,
[03:08:48.820 --> 03:08:51.140]   agree that his ideology is abhorrent,
[03:08:51.140 --> 03:08:53.140]   that this doesn't help poor people,
[03:08:53.140 --> 03:08:57.180]   it doesn't help shop owners, it creates a culture,
[03:08:57.180 --> 03:09:00.540]   an area where it's just deleterious to human life.
[03:09:00.540 --> 03:09:03.580]   However, he has, in one sense,
[03:09:03.580 --> 03:09:05.180]   given that he is a state operative,
[03:09:05.180 --> 03:09:07.140]   a legitimate worldview.
[03:09:07.140 --> 03:09:08.620]   - Can I ask you just a quick question?
[03:09:08.620 --> 03:09:09.460]   - Sure.
[03:09:09.460 --> 03:09:13.700]   - Why couldn't a security force in a particular context say,
[03:09:13.700 --> 03:09:16.660]   yeah, if you take stuff from that store,
[03:09:16.660 --> 03:09:19.020]   we're not gonna have any problem with that?
[03:09:19.020 --> 03:09:20.260]   - I agree with you, that's very fair.
[03:09:20.260 --> 03:09:21.700]   That's a very legitimate question.
[03:09:21.700 --> 03:09:24.900]   The point is, in the context that I'm talking about,
[03:09:24.900 --> 03:09:27.220]   that firm is like, wait a minute,
[03:09:27.220 --> 03:09:29.020]   I'm hiring you for security,
[03:09:29.020 --> 03:09:31.060]   you're saying we're not gonna provide security,
[03:09:31.060 --> 03:09:32.380]   why am I writing you a check?
[03:09:32.380 --> 03:09:34.780]   And we have examples of this in real life.
[03:09:34.780 --> 03:09:38.260]   If I get into a car accident with you, right,
[03:09:38.260 --> 03:09:41.660]   you have your car insurance, I have my car insurance,
[03:09:41.660 --> 03:09:43.620]   if your car insurance had their druthers,
[03:09:43.620 --> 03:09:45.300]   they wouldn't pay me one penny.
[03:09:45.300 --> 03:09:47.460]   If my car insurance didn't have their druthers,
[03:09:47.460 --> 03:09:48.940]   they wouldn't pay you one penny.
[03:09:48.940 --> 03:09:51.660]   We already have all, you were saying earlier
[03:09:51.660 --> 03:09:54.340]   that we need to have one kind of umbrella mechanism.
[03:09:54.340 --> 03:09:56.580]   There are already more cases than you can count
[03:09:56.580 --> 03:09:59.220]   where there's private arbitration.
[03:09:59.220 --> 03:10:02.660]   Now, the argument is that private arbitration only works
[03:10:02.660 --> 03:10:04.860]   because they have recourse to the government.
[03:10:04.860 --> 03:10:07.540]   But my point is, there's many examples
[03:10:07.540 --> 03:10:10.300]   where even though that recourse is theoretically possible,
[03:10:10.300 --> 03:10:12.340]   it's not a realistic concern,
[03:10:12.340 --> 03:10:15.380]   specifically because they know
[03:10:15.380 --> 03:10:17.540]   that if you have recourse to the state,
[03:10:17.540 --> 03:10:20.420]   you have no concept of what that outcome
[03:10:20.420 --> 03:10:21.620]   is going to look like,
[03:10:21.620 --> 03:10:24.860]   except knowing it's gonna be exorbitant,
[03:10:24.860 --> 03:10:26.740]   it's going to be time consuming.
[03:10:26.740 --> 03:10:28.460]   Talk to the--
[03:10:28.460 --> 03:10:30.020]   - We can't use the state, right,
[03:10:30.020 --> 03:10:33.380]   I mean, I'm as critical as the state as it is right now,
[03:10:33.380 --> 03:10:35.860]   maybe not as critical as yours, not as critical as yours,
[03:10:35.860 --> 03:10:38.700]   but I'm quite critical of the state as it is right now.
[03:10:38.700 --> 03:10:41.100]   But let's say we got into a traffic accident
[03:10:41.100 --> 03:10:43.020]   and you have a Rolls Royce,
[03:10:43.020 --> 03:10:46.220]   and I destroyed your Rolls Royce,
[03:10:46.220 --> 03:10:48.460]   and my insurance company now owes your insurance company
[03:10:48.460 --> 03:10:49.420]   a lot of money.
[03:10:49.420 --> 03:10:51.460]   And let's imagine it's a lot of money just for the sake--
[03:10:51.460 --> 03:10:52.940]   - And that you're clearly guilty.
[03:10:52.940 --> 03:10:53.940]   - Yeah, clearly guilty.
[03:10:53.940 --> 03:10:55.620]   And my insurance company looks at the books
[03:10:55.620 --> 03:10:58.220]   and it goes, you know, I don't, really,
[03:10:58.220 --> 03:10:59.060]   I don't wanna pay this.
[03:10:59.060 --> 03:10:59.900]   - Sure.
[03:10:59.900 --> 03:11:00.720]   - And you know what,
[03:11:00.720 --> 03:11:02.100]   I've got bigger guns than his insurance company.
[03:11:02.100 --> 03:11:02.940]   - Sure.
[03:11:02.940 --> 03:11:05.140]   - And I'm just gonna take over their insurance company.
[03:11:05.140 --> 03:11:08.780]   And hostile takeover takes on a whole new meaning
[03:11:08.780 --> 03:11:12.220]   when I can muster guns on my behalf
[03:11:12.220 --> 03:11:17.220]   than in a hostile takeover in a capitalist context.
[03:11:17.220 --> 03:11:19.020]   That to me is what happens,
[03:11:19.020 --> 03:11:21.540]   that to me is inevitably what happens.
[03:11:21.540 --> 03:11:24.180]   And I think this is where the delusion comes in.
[03:11:24.180 --> 03:11:25.660]   The idea that everything,
[03:11:25.660 --> 03:11:29.580]   that when big money is involved and power is involved,
[03:11:29.580 --> 03:11:32.140]   remember, again, the same kind of politicians
[03:11:32.140 --> 03:11:35.740]   who today get into politics are likely to want to run
[03:11:35.740 --> 03:11:36.980]   some of these security agencies
[03:11:36.980 --> 03:11:39.060]   'cause they'll have a lot of power over people.
[03:11:39.060 --> 03:11:42.620]   So same kind of, maybe sociopaths would be--
[03:11:42.620 --> 03:11:43.820]   - I don't think it's the same skillset,
[03:11:43.820 --> 03:11:44.660]   but that's a separate issue.
[03:11:44.660 --> 03:11:46.820]   - I think it very much is.
[03:11:46.820 --> 03:11:47.660]   But--
[03:11:47.660 --> 03:11:48.860]   - You think the people in Washington
[03:11:48.860 --> 03:11:51.500]   are the same as CEOs psychologically and skillset-wise?
[03:11:51.500 --> 03:11:52.860]   - Well, today's CEOs, yes.
[03:11:52.860 --> 03:11:53.700]   - Okay.
[03:11:53.700 --> 03:11:54.520]   - Yes.
[03:11:54.520 --> 03:11:55.360]   - You might be right.
[03:11:55.360 --> 03:11:57.820]   - Because I think that's what's rewarded for a CEO
[03:11:57.820 --> 03:12:00.100]   is somebody who could get along with government.
[03:12:00.100 --> 03:12:00.940]   - Okay.
[03:12:00.940 --> 03:12:02.820]   - And I think the kind of CEO
[03:12:02.820 --> 03:12:04.500]   who is gonna run a security company,
[03:12:04.500 --> 03:12:06.380]   which is not just about business,
[03:12:06.380 --> 03:12:08.780]   it's about the use of force, it's about control,
[03:12:08.780 --> 03:12:10.620]   it's about negotiation with other entities
[03:12:10.620 --> 03:12:13.700]   that are using force, diplomacy.
[03:12:13.700 --> 03:12:16.900]   Then, and we should get back to objective law
[03:12:16.900 --> 03:12:17.900]   because I think it's essential to this whole argument.
[03:12:17.900 --> 03:12:19.180]   - I would love to get back to something.
[03:12:19.180 --> 03:12:22.140]   - I think all you get into is security agencies,
[03:12:22.140 --> 03:12:24.620]   fighting security agencies, and again, the biggest gun.
[03:12:24.620 --> 03:12:26.620]   And I don't mean here the guy
[03:12:26.620 --> 03:12:28.100]   who has the biggest literal gun,
[03:12:28.100 --> 03:12:29.540]   the rocket launcher versus the guns.
[03:12:29.540 --> 03:12:31.260]   - I got excited for a second.
[03:12:31.260 --> 03:12:32.100]   - By the biggest gun?
[03:12:32.100 --> 03:12:32.940]   - Yeah.
[03:12:32.940 --> 03:12:35.540]   - The party that has the more physical force,
[03:12:35.540 --> 03:12:37.940]   however that is mustered either by numbers
[03:12:37.940 --> 03:12:39.780]   or by weapons is going to dominate.
[03:12:39.780 --> 03:12:40.620]   - Can I--
[03:12:40.620 --> 03:12:41.460]   - And will take over everybody else.
[03:12:41.460 --> 03:12:42.820]   Now, one of the things that's common
[03:12:42.820 --> 03:12:45.140]   in a market is takeovers.
[03:12:45.140 --> 03:12:47.140]   It's consolidation.
[03:12:47.140 --> 03:12:50.940]   And here, the consolidation can happen through force
[03:12:50.940 --> 03:12:53.980]   and you can roll other security companies.
[03:12:53.980 --> 03:12:55.420]   And that's exactly what will happen
[03:12:55.420 --> 03:12:57.820]   until you dominate the particular geographic area.
[03:12:57.820 --> 03:12:59.940]   - Okay, so let me explain why I disagree with that.
[03:12:59.940 --> 03:13:01.920]   You were just saying, and I agree correctly,
[03:13:01.920 --> 03:13:03.860]   I agree with you, that, listen,
[03:13:03.860 --> 03:13:05.860]   if I have access to the bigger gun,
[03:13:05.860 --> 03:13:08.060]   why am I paying you or whoever's paying whatever?
[03:13:08.060 --> 03:13:10.460]   I'm just gonna use force and not pay them.
[03:13:10.460 --> 03:13:12.540]   We have that right now, it's called lobbying.
[03:13:12.540 --> 03:13:16.620]   So instead of me, and I'm sure in your example,
[03:13:16.620 --> 03:13:17.460]   you weren't being literal,
[03:13:17.460 --> 03:13:20.860]   instead of the insurance company literally having the army,
[03:13:20.860 --> 03:13:23.100]   they could be like, hey, let me call Corruptco,
[03:13:23.100 --> 03:13:23.940]   with the mafia.
[03:13:23.940 --> 03:13:24.780]   - I agree.
[03:13:24.780 --> 03:13:25.620]   - Go out and take them out.
[03:13:25.620 --> 03:13:28.220]   By having this federal government, as you know,
[03:13:28.220 --> 03:13:30.420]   and certainly I'm not a fan of,
[03:13:30.420 --> 03:13:35.020]   has, takes more through asset forfeiture
[03:13:35.020 --> 03:13:36.580]   than burglaries combined.
[03:13:36.580 --> 03:13:38.740]   What asset forfeiture is, people don't even understand this.
[03:13:38.740 --> 03:13:40.700]   This is something crazy, which you are on.
[03:13:40.700 --> 03:13:41.520]   - It's unbelievable.
[03:13:41.520 --> 03:13:43.540]   - It's as opposed to me, as opposed as I am,
[03:13:43.540 --> 03:13:47.020]   which is I'm a cop, I go to your house,
[03:13:47.020 --> 03:13:50.420]   I think you haven't been charged or convicted of anything,
[03:13:50.420 --> 03:13:51.500]   I have evidence.
[03:13:51.500 --> 03:13:52.420]   - It's usually in a car.
[03:13:52.420 --> 03:13:54.460]   - Yeah, yeah, but no, it's like drug deals, okay?
[03:13:54.460 --> 03:13:56.900]   I go to your house, you're a drug dealer.
[03:13:56.900 --> 03:14:00.500]   I say, and you can understand the reasoning,
[03:14:00.500 --> 03:14:02.660]   well, if someone is getting profit
[03:14:02.660 --> 03:14:04.660]   through illegal mechanisms,
[03:14:04.660 --> 03:14:06.340]   their profit isn't real, their property,
[03:14:06.340 --> 03:14:07.760]   and they shouldn't be rewarded that property.
[03:14:07.760 --> 03:14:10.500]   So basically, I go to your house, you're a drug dealer,
[03:14:10.500 --> 03:14:12.560]   I seize all your property.
[03:14:12.560 --> 03:14:14.180]   You don't really have recourse,
[03:14:14.180 --> 03:14:15.500]   even though you haven't been through deep,
[03:14:15.500 --> 03:14:16.500]   I'm just explaining to the audience,
[03:14:16.500 --> 03:14:19.780]   been through deep new process and SOL.
[03:14:19.780 --> 03:14:22.900]   That combined, for people who don't know,
[03:14:22.900 --> 03:14:26.180]   is more than the total amount of burglaries in America.
[03:14:26.180 --> 03:14:29.260]   It's a huge, and what happens is the police department,
[03:14:29.260 --> 03:14:30.700]   which seizes your car auctions,
[03:14:30.700 --> 03:14:32.020]   it seizes your house auctions,
[03:14:32.020 --> 03:14:34.220]   it's a great way to line their pockets.
[03:14:34.220 --> 03:14:36.540]   This is a huge incentive, it's horrible.
[03:14:36.540 --> 03:14:41.260]   It's a huge incentive for police departments to do this,
[03:14:41.260 --> 03:14:43.640]   because it's like, look, this guy's a crook,
[03:14:43.640 --> 03:14:46.620]   maybe he's not a drug dealer, but he's clearly a pimp.
[03:14:46.620 --> 03:14:47.780]   Let me just take all his stuff,
[03:14:47.780 --> 03:14:49.140]   and it's gonna go to the community.
[03:14:49.140 --> 03:14:51.820]   - Well, and the rationale originally was,
[03:14:51.820 --> 03:14:55.100]   if I try him, in the meantime, he'll take that money,
[03:14:55.100 --> 03:14:58.220]   and funnel it somewhere else, and hide it,
[03:14:58.220 --> 03:14:59.980]   and I'll never be able to get access to it.
[03:14:59.980 --> 03:15:02.100]   And it was passed in the 1970s,
[03:15:02.100 --> 03:15:04.540]   under the original Caesar laws,
[03:15:04.540 --> 03:15:07.500]   what kind of RICO Act, going after the mafia.
[03:15:07.500 --> 03:15:11.380]   And one of the reasons I despise Giuliani as much as I do,
[03:15:11.380 --> 03:15:12.940]   and there's very few politicians out there
[03:15:12.940 --> 03:15:15.940]   that I despise more, is because he was the first guy
[03:15:15.940 --> 03:15:18.100]   to use RICO on financiers.
[03:15:18.100 --> 03:15:19.740]   And so it wasn't even a drug deal.
[03:15:19.740 --> 03:15:23.340]   It was, you were accused of a financial fraud.
[03:15:23.340 --> 03:15:26.940]   - Not, you weren't shown to be guilty, accused.
[03:15:26.940 --> 03:15:27.780]   - Yeah.
[03:15:27.780 --> 03:15:30.140]   - All your assets basically were forfeiture.
[03:15:30.140 --> 03:15:31.940]   - Innocent until proven guilty, went out the window.
[03:15:31.940 --> 03:15:34.060]   - If you were managing money, you were done,
[03:15:34.060 --> 03:15:34.900]   you were finished.
[03:15:34.900 --> 03:15:36.020]   - So you're saying this kind of stuff
[03:15:36.020 --> 03:15:37.420]   naturally emerges with the states.
[03:15:37.420 --> 03:15:39.980]   - Hold on, so my point is, what are presented
[03:15:39.980 --> 03:15:42.100]   as the strongest criticism of anarchism,
[03:15:42.100 --> 03:15:44.260]   are inevitably descriptions of status quo.
[03:15:44.260 --> 03:15:47.020]   What you're describing is already the event.
[03:15:47.020 --> 03:15:50.820]   I am a big insurance company, I don't wanna pay you,
[03:15:50.820 --> 03:15:53.060]   I call Washington, either I pay you
[03:15:53.060 --> 03:15:54.620]   and Washington gives me a subsidy.
[03:15:54.620 --> 03:15:57.820]   So what you're describing is an inevitable aspect
[03:15:57.820 --> 03:15:59.180]   of having a government.
[03:15:59.180 --> 03:16:02.060]   - So what I'm describing is the inevitable evolution
[03:16:02.060 --> 03:16:03.500]   of anarchy into a government.
[03:16:03.500 --> 03:16:04.540]   I just think that the--
[03:16:04.540 --> 03:16:06.420]   - Markets don't consolidate into monopoly.
[03:16:06.420 --> 03:16:08.420]   That's a leftist propaganda myth.
[03:16:08.420 --> 03:16:12.060]   - Not markets where you have substitute products,
[03:16:12.060 --> 03:16:13.340]   but this is the problem.
[03:16:13.340 --> 03:16:15.580]   The problem is force has no substitute.
[03:16:15.580 --> 03:16:18.020]   That is force is not a product you can have.
[03:16:18.020 --> 03:16:19.980]   So this is my fundamental issue
[03:16:19.980 --> 03:16:22.660]   about turning competing police forces.
[03:16:22.660 --> 03:16:24.140]   Force is not a product.
[03:16:24.140 --> 03:16:25.180]   Force is not a service. - It's a service.
[03:16:25.180 --> 03:16:26.580]   - It's not a service and it's not a product.
[03:16:26.580 --> 03:16:27.540]   - Security is not a service?
[03:16:27.540 --> 03:16:31.940]   - No, well security in the context of a legal system is,
[03:16:31.940 --> 03:16:34.260]   but this is the point, the legal system,
[03:16:34.260 --> 03:16:37.580]   the laws are not a service or a product.
[03:16:37.580 --> 03:16:41.940]   They are a different type of human institution.
[03:16:41.940 --> 03:16:44.620]   Science is not a product or service.
[03:16:44.620 --> 03:16:46.460]   It's a different type of human institution.
[03:16:46.460 --> 03:16:48.020]   There are different types of human institutions.
[03:16:48.020 --> 03:16:50.620]   Some are marketable, you can create markets in,
[03:16:50.620 --> 03:16:51.780]   some you cannot.
[03:16:51.780 --> 03:16:54.300]   Law is not a marketable system.
[03:16:54.300 --> 03:16:55.700]   - Can I ask a question quickly?
[03:16:55.700 --> 03:16:57.860]   Is there any other field other than law
[03:16:57.860 --> 03:16:59.580]   that you think you can't create markets?
[03:16:59.580 --> 03:17:00.420]   - Well, science.
[03:17:00.420 --> 03:17:01.660]   Science is not marketable.
[03:17:01.660 --> 03:17:03.060]   The science itself is not marketable.
[03:17:03.060 --> 03:17:04.380]   Well, sure, science is true.
[03:17:04.380 --> 03:17:05.740]   And the same, I think, is in law.
[03:17:05.740 --> 03:17:06.900]   Law is not marketable.
[03:17:06.900 --> 03:17:10.780]   Law is the system that allows markets to happen.
[03:17:10.780 --> 03:17:13.260]   You need a system of law, whether it's private law
[03:17:13.260 --> 03:17:16.540]   in a particular narrow context or whether it's broader law.
[03:17:16.540 --> 03:17:20.220]   Law is the context in which markets arise.
[03:17:20.220 --> 03:17:23.180]   So one of the reasons we transact is we know
[03:17:23.180 --> 03:17:24.860]   that there's a certain contract between us,
[03:17:24.860 --> 03:17:27.780]   explicit or implicit, that is protected by a certain law,
[03:17:27.780 --> 03:17:29.740]   whether it's protected by private agency,
[03:17:29.740 --> 03:17:30.700]   the government doesn't matter,
[03:17:30.700 --> 03:17:34.340]   but there's a certain contract that is protectable, right?
[03:17:34.340 --> 03:17:35.500]   By a system. - Theoretically.
[03:17:35.500 --> 03:17:36.900]   - Theoretically, yes. - Yes.
[03:17:36.900 --> 03:17:40.540]   - So law is the context in which markets arise.
[03:17:40.540 --> 03:17:45.540]   You don't create a market because there's nothing above it,
[03:17:45.540 --> 03:17:46.940]   in a sense.
[03:17:46.940 --> 03:17:49.060]   There's no, it is the context
[03:17:49.060 --> 03:17:51.180]   that allows markets to be created.
[03:17:51.180 --> 03:17:54.300]   Once you market it, markets fall apart.
[03:17:54.300 --> 03:17:55.140]   - So hold on a second.
[03:17:55.140 --> 03:17:55.980]   Yaron, hold on.
[03:17:55.980 --> 03:17:58.940]   So you think that law could be a market?
[03:17:58.940 --> 03:18:00.220]   - And it already is a market.
[03:18:00.220 --> 03:18:02.140]   And we see it, for example, eBay.
[03:18:02.140 --> 03:18:04.180]   If I am buying something from Yaron,
[03:18:04.180 --> 03:18:05.420]   I won't even know his name.
[03:18:05.420 --> 03:18:08.060]   I don't know, maybe he's in another country.
[03:18:08.060 --> 03:18:10.740]   And he screws me out of the money.
[03:18:10.740 --> 03:18:12.780]   I don't have access, I can't sue you.
[03:18:12.780 --> 03:18:15.100]   Or if I sue you in England, good luck with that.
[03:18:15.100 --> 03:18:16.700]   You're not gonna argue that I'm gonna sue you.
[03:18:16.700 --> 03:18:17.860]   What happens in this case,
[03:18:17.860 --> 03:18:19.900]   which has already been solved by the market,
[03:18:19.900 --> 03:18:22.860]   eBay and PayPal, which has access to your bank account,
[03:18:22.860 --> 03:18:24.580]   they act as the private arbiter.
[03:18:24.580 --> 03:18:26.460]   They're gonna get it wrong a lot.
[03:18:26.460 --> 03:18:29.780]   Not even a question, just like Yaron's not gonna argue
[03:18:29.780 --> 03:18:31.780]   that the government right now gets it wrong a lot.
[03:18:31.780 --> 03:18:32.780]   That's not even a question.
[03:18:32.780 --> 03:18:35.660]   The point is, at the very least,
[03:18:35.660 --> 03:18:37.980]   I'm going to get my resolution faster
[03:18:37.980 --> 03:18:39.700]   cheaper and more effectively.
[03:18:39.700 --> 03:18:42.660]   So the issue with having any kind of government, anything,
[03:18:42.660 --> 03:18:44.740]   and Yaron's not gonna disagree with this,
[03:18:44.740 --> 03:18:47.580]   is at the very least, it's going to be expensive,
[03:18:47.580 --> 03:18:50.620]   inefficient, and cause conflict.
[03:18:50.620 --> 03:18:53.060]   - Yeah, but I think what it allows is exactly--
[03:18:53.060 --> 03:18:56.340]   - We don't even know what the Supreme Court's gonna judge.
[03:18:56.340 --> 03:18:58.540]   - Again, you're moving us to today's environment,
[03:18:58.540 --> 03:19:00.580]   which I'm against, right? - I'm moving us to reality.
[03:19:00.580 --> 03:19:03.460]   - No, but reality doesn't have to be what it is.
[03:19:03.460 --> 03:19:04.340]   I mean-- (Zubin laughs)
[03:19:04.340 --> 03:19:05.700]   - That's the most anti-Rand quote.
[03:19:05.700 --> 03:19:07.260]   - No, in a sense-- - Reality doesn't have
[03:19:07.260 --> 03:19:09.260]   to be what it is. - In a sense of the politics.
[03:19:09.260 --> 03:19:10.580]   The political reality. - I know,
[03:19:10.580 --> 03:19:11.700]   but the quote by itself is great.
[03:19:11.700 --> 03:19:12.980]   - I know, I know, you'd love to--
[03:19:12.980 --> 03:19:14.940]   - He agrees with Donald Hoffman, is what he's saying.
[03:19:14.940 --> 03:19:16.300]   - Yeah, it turns out I agree with Hoffman.
[03:19:16.300 --> 03:19:18.100]   - He's an elf, is what it is.
[03:19:18.100 --> 03:19:20.780]   - So it's, where were we?
[03:19:20.780 --> 03:19:23.220]   So I believe that because we have
[03:19:23.220 --> 03:19:25.460]   a certain system of government, right,
[03:19:25.460 --> 03:19:29.500]   it allows for these private innovations to come about
[03:19:29.500 --> 03:19:32.740]   that facilitate certain issues in a much more efficient way
[03:19:32.740 --> 03:19:33.980]   than the government would deal with it.
[03:19:33.980 --> 03:19:37.980]   But it's only because we have a particular system
[03:19:37.980 --> 03:19:40.140]   that has defined property rights,
[03:19:40.140 --> 03:19:42.820]   that has a clear view of what property rights are,
[03:19:42.820 --> 03:19:45.980]   it has a clear view of what a transaction mean
[03:19:45.980 --> 03:19:48.060]   or what contract law is,
[03:19:48.060 --> 03:19:50.860]   and eBay has a bunch of stuff that you sign,
[03:19:50.860 --> 03:19:52.340]   whether you read it or not. - Sure, of course.
[03:19:52.340 --> 03:19:55.220]   - All of that is defined first,
[03:19:55.220 --> 03:19:57.260]   and then there are massive innovations
[03:19:57.260 --> 03:20:00.940]   at the level of particular transactions,
[03:20:00.940 --> 03:20:02.420]   at the level of an eBay,
[03:20:02.420 --> 03:20:06.300]   that facilitate increased efficiency, and that's great.
[03:20:06.300 --> 03:20:08.380]   But the fact is, none of that gets developed,
[03:20:08.380 --> 03:20:10.140]   none of that gets created.
[03:20:10.140 --> 03:20:12.180]   In a world in which I might be living
[03:20:12.180 --> 03:20:14.340]   under a different definition of property rights,
[03:20:14.340 --> 03:20:16.260]   eBay might be living under a separate definition
[03:20:16.260 --> 03:20:18.140]   of property rights, you might have a third definition
[03:20:18.140 --> 03:20:20.620]   of property rights, and there's no mechanism
[03:20:20.620 --> 03:20:23.540]   by which we can actually operationalize that,
[03:20:23.540 --> 03:20:25.020]   because we all have a different system of law.
[03:20:25.020 --> 03:20:26.940]   - There is a mechanism, we already have that.
[03:20:26.940 --> 03:20:28.820]   Let's change the example I just used.
[03:20:28.820 --> 03:20:30.580]   What happens if a Chinese person
[03:20:30.580 --> 03:20:32.460]   who has different definition of property rights
[03:20:32.460 --> 03:20:35.100]   kills an American in Brazil?
[03:20:35.100 --> 03:20:38.140]   - Again, in a smaller community,
[03:20:38.140 --> 03:20:40.220]   what happens is lots of violence.
[03:20:40.220 --> 03:20:41.540]   - No, but I'm talking about right now.
[03:20:41.540 --> 03:20:42.940]   If a Chinese person had--
[03:20:42.940 --> 03:20:45.460]   - Right now, the only reason that it doesn't lead
[03:20:45.460 --> 03:20:47.380]   to violence is because people are afraid
[03:20:47.380 --> 03:20:50.860]   of even more violence, and it affects many people,
[03:20:50.860 --> 03:20:53.220]   large numbers of people who don't wanna go to war.
[03:20:53.220 --> 03:20:57.620]   But if you have small, in a state
[03:20:57.620 --> 03:20:59.260]   where the states were small,
[03:20:59.260 --> 03:21:02.060]   like in those little state, there was war all the time
[03:21:02.060 --> 03:21:05.740]   for exactly those reasons, because the cost was lower,
[03:21:05.740 --> 03:21:08.500]   because it was more personal,
[03:21:08.500 --> 03:21:11.260]   because I knew maybe the person who was killed over there,
[03:21:11.260 --> 03:21:13.860]   and I went to my king and encouraged him to go to war.
[03:21:13.860 --> 03:21:14.700]   - You know why there was war?
[03:21:14.700 --> 03:21:15.620]   - Violence is constant.
[03:21:15.620 --> 03:21:16.860]   - You know why there was war?
[03:21:16.860 --> 03:21:19.660]   Because there had been no Ayn Rand,
[03:21:19.660 --> 03:21:23.180]   and good ideas lead to good societies,
[03:21:23.180 --> 03:21:25.680]   which leads to good people, which leads to good behavior,
[03:21:25.680 --> 03:21:26.900]   good interrelationships.
[03:21:26.900 --> 03:21:29.140]   So now that we have Ayn Rand,
[03:21:29.140 --> 03:21:31.140]   all this stuff in the past is irrelevant,
[03:21:31.140 --> 03:21:32.620]   'cause if they studied her works,
[03:21:32.620 --> 03:21:37.180]   Rand was on "Donahue" again, you can watch the clip,
[03:21:37.180 --> 03:21:40.060]   and he asks her, she goes, he goes,
[03:21:40.060 --> 03:21:42.860]   "You're saying that if we were more selfish
[03:21:42.860 --> 03:21:46.060]   and acted more self-interest, there'd be less war,
[03:21:46.060 --> 03:21:48.940]   less Hitler," and she said, "There wouldn't be any."
[03:21:48.940 --> 03:21:50.940]   Right? - That's right.
[03:21:50.940 --> 03:21:51.780]   Well, if we were all selfish,
[03:21:51.780 --> 03:21:53.540]   there wouldn't be any Hitlers, right?
[03:21:53.540 --> 03:21:57.460]   - But who do you regard as the overweening authority
[03:21:57.460 --> 03:22:00.060]   if I am buying a product from you
[03:22:00.060 --> 03:22:02.580]   as someone in England via eBay?
[03:22:02.580 --> 03:22:04.140]   Who's the governing authority?
[03:22:04.140 --> 03:22:07.220]   - The governing authority is,
[03:22:07.220 --> 03:22:09.820]   are the legal systems in England and the United States,
[03:22:09.820 --> 03:22:11.940]   which have to be synchronized pretty well.
[03:22:11.940 --> 03:22:12.780]   - Right, but what I'm saying is--
[03:22:12.780 --> 03:22:16.100]   - It's why eBay doesn't function in certain countries,
[03:22:16.100 --> 03:22:17.100]   because there is no legal system--
[03:22:17.100 --> 03:22:17.940]   - I agree with you.
[03:22:17.940 --> 03:22:18.760]   - In those countries. - My point is,
[03:22:18.760 --> 03:22:20.980]   why do those legal systems have to be a function
[03:22:20.980 --> 03:22:22.780]   specifically of geography,
[03:22:22.780 --> 03:22:25.780]   as opposed to, why can't I, sitting here,
[03:22:25.780 --> 03:22:27.420]   I could sit here, you're not-- - Because--
[03:22:27.420 --> 03:22:28.260]   - Let me finish my point.
[03:22:28.260 --> 03:22:31.700]   I can sit here and be a British diplomat, right?
[03:22:31.700 --> 03:22:32.980]   And as a British diplomat,
[03:22:32.980 --> 03:22:35.500]   I'm going to be treated differently under American law
[03:22:35.500 --> 03:22:37.580]   than you are as an American citizen, as you are.
[03:22:37.580 --> 03:22:40.660]   Why can't you have that same process?
[03:22:40.660 --> 03:22:43.020]   Sure, we're geographically proximate,
[03:22:43.020 --> 03:22:45.180]   but I'm a citizen of this company,
[03:22:45.180 --> 03:22:47.180]   and you're a citizen of that company.
[03:22:47.180 --> 03:22:49.940]   Why would that be different, in your opinion?
[03:22:49.940 --> 03:22:52.340]   - If it's England and the United States,
[03:22:52.340 --> 03:22:55.240]   it's probably not gonna matter that much, right?
[03:22:55.240 --> 03:22:58.540]   But if it's Iran and the United States,
[03:22:58.540 --> 03:23:00.860]   then the fact that we're sitting next to each other
[03:23:00.860 --> 03:23:03.220]   makes a huge difference, massive difference.
[03:23:03.220 --> 03:23:05.220]   And the fact is that,
[03:23:05.220 --> 03:23:07.780]   and Ayn Rand, I think, would be the first to acknowledge this
[03:23:07.780 --> 03:23:10.420]   and this is why she was so opposed to anarchy.
[03:23:10.420 --> 03:23:12.180]   It's not-- - That's not why.
[03:23:12.180 --> 03:23:13.540]   - It is why. - It's 'cause of Rothbard.
[03:23:13.540 --> 03:23:15.180]   - No, it has nothing to do with--
[03:23:15.180 --> 03:23:16.340]   - Nothing? - It has nothing to do
[03:23:16.340 --> 03:23:17.180]   with Rothbard. - Nothing.
[03:23:17.180 --> 03:23:18.140]   - Nothing. - How do you know?
[03:23:18.140 --> 03:23:19.060]   - Nothing. - How would you know?
[03:23:19.060 --> 03:23:22.180]   - Because her argument against anarchy
[03:23:22.180 --> 03:23:23.980]   is an intellectual one, not a personality--
[03:23:23.980 --> 03:23:25.640]   - It's gotta be both? - Anyway, but--
[03:23:25.640 --> 03:23:27.320]   - No, it has nothing to do-- - Back to it, back to Iran.
[03:23:27.320 --> 03:23:28.520]   Back to Iran. (laughs)
[03:23:28.520 --> 03:23:30.320]   - No, it has nothing to do with Rothbard.
[03:23:30.320 --> 03:23:32.280]   - You don't know that, you're not a psychic,
[03:23:32.280 --> 03:23:33.240]   or a necromancer.
[03:23:33.240 --> 03:23:36.240]   - The only way we're gonna resolve this is arm wrestling,
[03:23:36.240 --> 03:23:37.360]   right, it's through violence.
[03:23:37.360 --> 03:23:38.760]   - Arm wrestling's not violence.
[03:23:38.760 --> 03:23:39.960]   (laughs)
[03:23:39.960 --> 03:23:41.320]   - Words are violence.
[03:23:41.320 --> 03:23:42.600]   - Words are violence, Yaron.
[03:23:42.600 --> 03:23:44.800]   - Words are violence, emotions are violence.
[03:23:44.800 --> 03:23:45.840]   (laughs)
[03:23:45.840 --> 03:23:47.480]   - So, wait, but-- - He throws me off
[03:23:47.480 --> 03:23:49.160]   with this stuff, but that's the problem.
[03:23:49.160 --> 03:23:50.760]   - Even facts and truths? - He's very, very good.
[03:23:50.760 --> 03:23:51.800]   No, not facts and truths.
[03:23:51.800 --> 03:23:54.540]   I mean, there's distortions and arbitrary statements,
[03:23:54.540 --> 03:23:55.900]   because your statement about Rothbard
[03:23:55.900 --> 03:23:59.540]   is an arbitrary statement that has no cognitive standing,
[03:23:59.540 --> 03:24:01.060]   and therefore I can dismiss it.
[03:24:01.060 --> 03:24:03.260]   So I'm not doing like this because I wanna dismiss it.
[03:24:03.260 --> 03:24:05.020]   It has no cognitive status.
[03:24:05.020 --> 03:24:07.020]   The fact that she disliked Rothbard
[03:24:07.020 --> 03:24:08.860]   doesn't mean that everything he said
[03:24:08.860 --> 03:24:10.380]   she was gonna dismiss because she disliked him.
[03:24:10.380 --> 03:24:11.940]   - I agree with you, but what I'm saying is,
[03:24:11.940 --> 03:24:14.580]   it would not be impossible-- - But there's no evidence.
[03:24:14.580 --> 03:24:16.700]   - I'll give you, I'll talk, I'll give you some evidence.
[03:24:16.700 --> 03:24:18.220]   Human psychology.
[03:24:18.220 --> 03:24:22.000]   It is not impossible that if you hate some,
[03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:23.360]   what's his name, what's that guy's name?
[03:24:23.360 --> 03:24:24.600]   - Richard Wolff. - Richard Wolff, right.
[03:24:24.600 --> 03:24:28.360]   It's not impossible that if Richard Wolff said something
[03:24:28.360 --> 03:24:30.480]   that you would otherwise agree with,
[03:24:30.480 --> 03:24:32.360]   hold on, let me finish, you'd be dismissive
[03:24:32.360 --> 03:24:34.360]   or less likely to give him credit for it,
[03:24:34.360 --> 03:24:35.380]   being a human being.
[03:24:35.380 --> 03:24:36.220]   That's all I'm saying.
[03:24:36.220 --> 03:24:38.560]   - It's as silly as to say Rothbard came up
[03:24:38.560 --> 03:24:42.160]   with this theory of anarchy because he was pissed off
[03:24:42.160 --> 03:24:44.000]   at Ayn Rand and wanted to write something.
[03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:45.840]   - I don't know, bring it down,
[03:24:45.840 --> 03:24:48.880]   because bring it down so that he can speak too
[03:24:48.880 --> 03:24:51.120]   and let's keep it, because--
[03:24:51.120 --> 03:24:52.240]   - I don't think we're getting agitated.
[03:24:52.240 --> 03:24:53.360]   - No, you guys aren't.
[03:24:53.360 --> 03:24:54.200]   No, no, no.
[03:24:54.200 --> 03:24:55.820]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:24:55.820 --> 03:24:57.880]   - Bring it down not in terms of,
[03:24:57.880 --> 03:25:02.800]   in terms of give more pauses so Michael can insert himself.
[03:25:02.800 --> 03:25:03.640]   That's what I mean.
[03:25:03.640 --> 03:25:05.400]   - See, private governance. - What's the point of that?
[03:25:05.400 --> 03:25:06.240]   - Private governance. - No, God.
[03:25:06.240 --> 03:25:08.720]   - Look, he's, look, it's private governance.
[03:25:08.720 --> 03:25:09.560]   - I'm all for private governance.
[03:25:09.560 --> 03:25:12.360]   - I'm trying to establish a geographic law of the land.
[03:25:12.360 --> 03:25:13.600]   I don't know. - That's not the point.
[03:25:13.600 --> 03:25:15.400]   - I do think that Michael's,
[03:25:15.400 --> 03:25:17.480]   I mean, that's interesting that you disagree with this.
[03:25:17.480 --> 03:25:21.880]   I do believe that psychology has an impact on ideas
[03:25:21.880 --> 03:25:25.640]   and Ayn Rand, you don't think Ayn Rand had grudges
[03:25:25.640 --> 03:25:29.400]   that impacted the way she saw the world?
[03:25:29.400 --> 03:25:31.680]   I would like to think that--
[03:25:31.680 --> 03:25:33.100]   - I don't think any of her grudges
[03:25:33.100 --> 03:25:34.800]   entered into philosophical statements,
[03:25:34.800 --> 03:25:36.960]   at least not that I can tell.
[03:25:36.960 --> 03:25:41.200]   And I don't see, and given the centrality Ayn Rand gave,
[03:25:41.200 --> 03:25:43.560]   and if you, to the role of government,
[03:25:43.560 --> 03:25:44.400]   to the existence of government,
[03:25:44.400 --> 03:25:48.400]   to the need for government, to establish real freedom,
[03:25:48.400 --> 03:25:49.840]   and the way she defines freedom,
[03:25:49.840 --> 03:25:51.560]   which is very different than Rothbard,
[03:25:51.560 --> 03:25:53.280]   and the way she defines government,
[03:25:53.280 --> 03:25:57.600]   to say then that her opposition to anarchy
[03:25:57.600 --> 03:26:00.600]   is because of, I think is just an arbitrary statement.
[03:26:00.600 --> 03:26:01.440]   - I didn't say because of.
[03:26:01.440 --> 03:26:03.280]   I didn't say because of, I said followed by.
[03:26:03.280 --> 03:26:07.200]   - And not, and I don't see why psychology would answer it.
[03:26:07.200 --> 03:26:10.620]   Now, maybe the tone in which you responded to an answer
[03:26:10.620 --> 03:26:12.280]   might have been motivated by that or something like,
[03:26:12.280 --> 03:26:14.000]   but given the amount of thought she gave
[03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:15.400]   to the role of government in human society
[03:26:15.400 --> 03:26:17.000]   and why government was needed,
[03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:20.280]   and why you needed laws in order to be free,
[03:26:20.280 --> 03:26:22.280]   that freedom didn't proceed,
[03:26:22.280 --> 03:26:25.520]   you needed the right hierarchy.
[03:26:25.520 --> 03:26:28.840]   I think that we could say that,
[03:26:28.840 --> 03:26:32.560]   give it at least the respect that she, this was,
[03:26:32.560 --> 03:26:34.240]   she might've been wrong, right?
[03:26:34.240 --> 03:26:37.980]   But she had a particular theory that rejected anarchy,
[03:26:37.980 --> 03:26:39.360]   and the thought anarchy was wrong.
[03:26:39.480 --> 03:26:40.320]   - Okay, hold on.
[03:26:40.320 --> 03:26:42.960]   I really resent, and I'm not saying you're doing this,
[03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:47.280]   the implication that if Rand was guided by her passions,
[03:26:47.280 --> 03:26:49.800]   that somehow is a criticism of her or lessens her.
[03:26:49.800 --> 03:26:52.280]   I think Rand was a very passionate person.
[03:26:52.280 --> 03:26:56.840]   I think she loved her husband enormously.
[03:26:56.840 --> 03:27:00.040]   She despised certain people enormously.
[03:27:00.040 --> 03:27:02.280]   And I don't think that there's anything wrong with that.
[03:27:02.280 --> 03:27:04.520]   - I don't think she would change her philosophical position
[03:27:04.520 --> 03:27:06.240]   about something because she disliked somebody.
[03:27:06.240 --> 03:27:07.080]   - I agree, but what I'm saying--
[03:27:07.080 --> 03:27:08.600]   - Given the amount of thought she gave
[03:27:08.600 --> 03:27:09.440]   to that philosophical position.
[03:27:09.440 --> 03:27:12.680]   - All I'm saying is, it is possible
[03:27:12.680 --> 03:27:15.320]   that if someone comes across ideas
[03:27:15.320 --> 03:27:17.840]   that she had not considered before,
[03:27:17.840 --> 03:27:20.680]   if she regarded this person as a bad actor,
[03:27:20.680 --> 03:27:23.600]   like all of us, she would be less likely
[03:27:23.600 --> 03:27:25.000]   to take them under consideration.
[03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:25.840]   - Sure.
[03:27:25.840 --> 03:27:26.660]   - That's all I'm saying.
[03:27:26.660 --> 03:27:29.400]   - Sure, and I think other people confronted her
[03:27:29.400 --> 03:27:30.320]   with ideas of anarchy.
[03:27:30.320 --> 03:27:31.760]   I don't think Rothbard was the only one.
[03:27:31.760 --> 03:27:32.960]   - Correct, Roy Charles as well, yeah.
[03:27:32.960 --> 03:27:34.000]   - Roy Charles certainly did.
[03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:35.560]   And she rejected them, and she rejected them
[03:27:35.560 --> 03:27:38.520]   because she had, and whether you agree with her or not,
[03:27:38.520 --> 03:27:41.280]   she had a thought out position
[03:27:41.280 --> 03:27:46.040]   about why you needed to have this particular structure
[03:27:46.040 --> 03:27:49.840]   in place so that markets and human freedom could exist.
[03:27:49.840 --> 03:27:51.080]   - It's just really interesting
[03:27:51.080 --> 03:27:54.000]   because this is the one time, in my view,
[03:27:54.000 --> 03:27:55.640]   and please correct me if I'm wrong,
[03:27:55.640 --> 03:27:59.280]   where she invokes need as kind of a basis
[03:27:59.280 --> 03:28:01.000]   for political activity.
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:04.080]   So let's suppose you want this federal government,
[03:28:04.080 --> 03:28:05.840]   whatever you want, you don't want it like it is now,
[03:28:05.840 --> 03:28:07.820]   but like your version of the government.
[03:28:07.820 --> 03:28:11.520]   I don't see why it's an issue for you,
[03:28:11.520 --> 03:28:15.960]   for me and Lex, to say we're not privy to Washington,
[03:28:15.960 --> 03:28:17.560]   we're gonna do our own thing,
[03:28:17.560 --> 03:28:21.300]   and given, if we go about our lives not initiating force
[03:28:21.300 --> 03:28:22.880]   and being productive actors,
[03:28:22.880 --> 03:28:24.080]   why she would have an issue with this.
[03:28:24.080 --> 03:28:25.020]   - Why would I care?
[03:28:25.020 --> 03:28:26.860]   - Well, you would care because if you're saying
[03:28:26.860 --> 03:28:28.660]   the government has a monopoly on force
[03:28:28.660 --> 03:28:29.840]   between these two oceans--
[03:28:29.840 --> 03:28:31.920]   - So you can do that as long as you don't violate
[03:28:31.920 --> 03:28:32.760]   somebody else's rights.
[03:28:32.760 --> 03:28:33.720]   - Sure, but what I'm saying is
[03:28:33.720 --> 03:28:35.560]   we just declare ourselves sovereign.
[03:28:35.560 --> 03:28:37.520]   We're not gonna pay any income taxes.
[03:28:37.520 --> 03:28:39.080]   We're gonna be peaceful people.
[03:28:39.080 --> 03:28:39.920]   We're gonna get your,
[03:28:39.920 --> 03:28:42.520]   and when Lex and I have disputes,
[03:28:42.520 --> 03:28:44.960]   we're gonna call Joe, that's Joe Rogan.
[03:28:44.960 --> 03:28:46.840]   You're never gonna get to meet him, but he's a good guy.
[03:28:46.840 --> 03:28:47.680]   - I know.
[03:28:47.680 --> 03:28:48.500]   (laughing)
[03:28:48.500 --> 03:28:50.920]   - We're gonna call Joe, and Joe's gonna resolve it.
[03:28:50.920 --> 03:28:53.080]   - He's so good at like, you know,
[03:28:53.080 --> 03:28:56.040]   needling and getting you off topic that way.
[03:28:56.040 --> 03:28:58.600]   It's really, he's really effective at it.
[03:28:58.600 --> 03:29:00.680]   - He's Muhammad Ali and you're Joe Frazier.
[03:29:00.680 --> 03:29:03.440]   - I always say when I debate communists,
[03:29:03.440 --> 03:29:04.880]   I always say to them--
[03:29:04.880 --> 03:29:06.220]   - You mean Lex?
[03:29:06.220 --> 03:29:08.000]   - Yeah, maybe Lex, maybe I should--
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:09.880]   - Tom Rad, I love you.
[03:29:09.880 --> 03:29:11.120]   - That if they really believe--
[03:29:11.120 --> 03:29:12.400]   - Burgundy, not Rad.
[03:29:12.400 --> 03:29:14.320]   - If they really believe in what they think,
[03:29:14.320 --> 03:29:15.840]   then they should be advocates for capitalism
[03:29:15.840 --> 03:29:18.080]   'cause under capitalism, under my system of government,
[03:29:18.080 --> 03:29:19.800]   capitalist government, right,
[03:29:19.800 --> 03:29:21.960]   they could go and start a commune.
[03:29:21.960 --> 03:29:22.960]   They can live a communist.
[03:29:22.960 --> 03:29:25.520]   They can live to each according to,
[03:29:25.520 --> 03:29:26.720]   to each according to his needs,
[03:29:26.720 --> 03:29:28.480]   from each according to his ability,
[03:29:28.480 --> 03:29:30.400]   all they want and live their pathetic,
[03:29:30.400 --> 03:29:31.680]   miserable lives that way,
[03:29:31.680 --> 03:29:33.520]   and the government would never intervene
[03:29:33.520 --> 03:29:37.020]   because the whole view of capitalism is freedom,
[03:29:37.020 --> 03:29:38.780]   is we live the way along, right?
[03:29:38.780 --> 03:29:40.340]   As long as you're not violating my rights,
[03:29:40.340 --> 03:29:42.080]   as long as you're not taking my property,
[03:29:42.080 --> 03:29:44.560]   as long as you're not engaging with,
[03:29:44.560 --> 03:29:48.500]   so in that sense, yeah, you and Lex can form your own thing.
[03:29:48.500 --> 03:29:50.540]   I don't believe in compulsory taxes anyway.
[03:29:50.540 --> 03:29:53.280]   So you and Lex can do your own thing, never pay taxes.
[03:29:53.280 --> 03:29:57.180]   As long as you're not violating the laws,
[03:29:57.180 --> 03:29:58.620]   and the laws are very limited, right,
[03:29:58.620 --> 03:30:00.100]   'cause they're only there to protect individual rights.
[03:30:00.100 --> 03:30:01.420]   So as long as you're not violating
[03:30:01.420 --> 03:30:02.580]   somebody else's property rights
[03:30:02.580 --> 03:30:06.180]   or inflicting force on anybody else, you're peaceful.
[03:30:06.180 --> 03:30:07.220]   You can do what you want.
[03:30:07.220 --> 03:30:08.540]   You know, don't have, yeah.
[03:30:08.540 --> 03:30:09.380]   - Great, case closed.
[03:30:09.380 --> 03:30:11.900]   - Don't have sex with kids, right?
[03:30:11.900 --> 03:30:13.340]   - I will stop immediately.
[03:30:13.340 --> 03:30:14.180]   - Good.
[03:30:14.180 --> 03:30:15.220]   - The rest of us are just playing checkers
[03:30:15.220 --> 03:30:16.100]   and he's playing chess.
[03:30:16.100 --> 03:30:18.180]   - Yeah, I mean, a government
[03:30:18.180 --> 03:30:19.900]   that protects individual rights properly
[03:30:19.900 --> 03:30:21.060]   is a government that leaves you alone
[03:30:21.060 --> 03:30:22.280]   to live your life as you see fit,
[03:30:22.280 --> 03:30:24.020]   even if you live your life in a way
[03:30:24.020 --> 03:30:26.020]   that I don't approve of, that I don't think is right.
[03:30:26.020 --> 03:30:27.140]   I mean, that's the whole point, right?
[03:30:27.140 --> 03:30:29.060]   - Okay, then we're in agreement.
[03:30:29.060 --> 03:30:31.040]   - The only thing you can do is,
[03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:35.000]   you know, try to enforce arbitrary laws
[03:30:35.000 --> 03:30:36.000]   that you come up with on me.
[03:30:36.000 --> 03:30:37.480]   - Of course, absolutely.
[03:30:37.480 --> 03:30:38.320]   Okay, great.
[03:30:38.320 --> 03:30:42.240]   - Wouldn't it be wonderful if we lived in a world
[03:30:42.240 --> 03:30:45.200]   where rights protecting laws are superfluous,
[03:30:45.200 --> 03:30:48.820]   but the reality is usually that somebody violates them,
[03:30:48.820 --> 03:30:52.360]   whether by accident or intentionally,
[03:30:52.360 --> 03:30:54.000]   and that you need some mechanism.
[03:30:54.000 --> 03:30:56.080]   Now, if you guys can resolve that dispute
[03:30:56.080 --> 03:30:58.720]   without getting involved, fine.
[03:30:58.720 --> 03:31:02.480]   But if you guys land up not wanting, not resolving,
[03:31:02.480 --> 03:31:05.720]   there is another authority that will help you resolve it.
[03:31:05.720 --> 03:31:06.560]   - Yeah, I'd come to that.
[03:31:06.560 --> 03:31:07.400]   - So can I ask you a question?
[03:31:07.400 --> 03:31:12.400]   Under anarchism, what kind of systems of laws
[03:31:12.400 --> 03:31:13.220]   do you think will emerge?
[03:31:13.220 --> 03:31:15.880]   Do you think we'll have basically a similar kind of layer
[03:31:15.880 --> 03:31:18.560]   of universal law to where like--
[03:31:18.560 --> 03:31:19.800]   - Let me answer this, this is a great question.
[03:31:19.800 --> 03:31:21.720]   I know what you're going to do with this.
[03:31:21.720 --> 03:31:25.360]   This is often presented as a criticism of anarchism,
[03:31:25.360 --> 03:31:27.280]   and this is actually something I think Yaron
[03:31:27.280 --> 03:31:30.080]   would agree with as well in other contexts, which is this.
[03:31:30.080 --> 03:31:32.440]   One of the reasons communism can't work,
[03:31:32.440 --> 03:31:33.480]   central planning can't work,
[03:31:33.480 --> 03:31:35.560]   and this was one of Mises' great innovations,
[03:31:35.560 --> 03:31:38.960]   is if I could sit down, it's like asking,
[03:31:38.960 --> 03:31:40.960]   what would the fashion industry look like
[03:31:40.960 --> 03:31:42.480]   if the government didn't run it?
[03:31:42.480 --> 03:31:43.960]   There's no way for me to know.
[03:31:43.960 --> 03:31:45.400]   What the fashion industry is,
[03:31:45.400 --> 03:31:47.360]   which all of us are in favor of it being free,
[03:31:47.360 --> 03:31:51.760]   is literally millions of designers, of seamstresses,
[03:31:51.760 --> 03:31:54.840]   of people who make the fabric,
[03:31:54.840 --> 03:31:56.520]   also references throughout history,
[03:31:56.520 --> 03:31:59.780]   and these creative artistic minds putting things together,
[03:31:59.780 --> 03:32:03.400]   and every year, and there's no shortage of clothes.
[03:32:03.400 --> 03:32:04.980]   In fact, we make so many clothes
[03:32:04.980 --> 03:32:07.120]   that we send them in landfill sizes
[03:32:07.120 --> 03:32:08.760]   to overseas poor countries,
[03:32:08.760 --> 03:32:10.440]   and you have people in these desolate countries
[03:32:10.440 --> 03:32:13.040]   wearing like Adidas shirts, they can't even read English,
[03:32:13.040 --> 03:32:15.080]   but because we don't know what to do with all these clothes.
[03:32:15.080 --> 03:32:18.400]   That's how the glory of free enterprise is.
[03:32:18.400 --> 03:32:21.560]   The problem is, problem used loosely,
[03:32:21.560 --> 03:32:24.960]   everything comes cheap and overabundant, like food.
[03:32:24.960 --> 03:32:26.440]   - Well, it doesn't actually come overabundant.
[03:32:26.440 --> 03:32:27.440]   It's done properly.
[03:32:27.440 --> 03:32:28.640]   - Sure, that's fair.
[03:32:28.640 --> 03:32:29.920]   - It's supply meets demand.
[03:32:29.920 --> 03:32:31.320]   - Sure, that's fair, but I'm saying is like,
[03:32:31.320 --> 03:32:33.240]   if 150 years ago you said,
[03:32:33.240 --> 03:32:34.840]   you know, one day we're gonna have an issue
[03:32:34.840 --> 03:32:36.760]   where there's gonna be so much food,
[03:32:36.760 --> 03:32:38.720]   and then the kids are too fat,
[03:32:38.720 --> 03:32:39.920]   it's just gonna be like,
[03:32:39.920 --> 03:32:42.960]   "I have four who are dead in the crib, I wish."
[03:32:42.960 --> 03:32:46.520]   I mean, what kind of paradise is this?
[03:32:46.520 --> 03:32:49.000]   So what you would have,
[03:32:49.000 --> 03:32:50.880]   we have this right now in certain centers,
[03:32:50.880 --> 03:32:52.880]   you have the Hasidim, you have Sharia,
[03:32:52.880 --> 03:32:54.320]   you have different, you have,
[03:32:54.320 --> 03:32:56.600]   I'm sure in the medical system,
[03:32:56.600 --> 03:32:58.120]   they have their own kind of private courts,
[03:32:58.120 --> 03:32:59.840]   and court-martials is another example of this,
[03:32:59.840 --> 03:33:01.400]   although obviously that's through the state.
[03:33:01.400 --> 03:33:05.920]   So you would have innovation in law under markets
[03:33:05.920 --> 03:33:07.200]   just the same way as you'd have it,
[03:33:07.200 --> 03:33:09.120]   and we have this already.
[03:33:09.120 --> 03:33:11.440]   Maybe it's not, Yaron doesn't like in terms of like,
[03:33:11.440 --> 03:33:13.480]   murder and rape, and I can understand why,
[03:33:13.480 --> 03:33:16.440]   but in terms of like, business and interactions,
[03:33:16.440 --> 03:33:19.360]   he would have no problem with different arbitration firms
[03:33:19.360 --> 03:33:21.080]   having different rules for like,
[03:33:21.080 --> 03:33:22.600]   what kind of evidence is allowed,
[03:33:22.600 --> 03:33:24.560]   maybe you only have 60 days to make your case,
[03:33:24.560 --> 03:33:25.720]   and so on and so forth,
[03:33:25.720 --> 03:33:29.000]   and the market is a process of creative innovation,
[03:33:29.000 --> 03:33:30.760]   and it would be dynamic, it would be changing over time.
[03:33:30.760 --> 03:33:33.560]   - So what's interesting relating to this is,
[03:33:33.560 --> 03:33:35.320]   one of the ways Ayn Rand proposed
[03:33:35.320 --> 03:33:36.560]   raising revenue for the government,
[03:33:36.560 --> 03:33:40.040]   'cause she was against, was, let's say we have a contract.
[03:33:40.040 --> 03:33:43.440]   We could just have it arbitrated
[03:33:43.440 --> 03:33:45.560]   without government interfering,
[03:33:45.560 --> 03:33:48.480]   but if we wanted to access the courts of the government
[03:33:48.480 --> 03:33:51.280]   as a final authority, we would pay,
[03:33:51.280 --> 03:33:53.000]   and that's how governments would raise,
[03:33:53.000 --> 03:33:55.600]   some of the funds would be raised that way.
[03:33:55.600 --> 03:34:00.600]   So there's definitely a value to having this innovation
[03:34:00.600 --> 03:34:01.920]   and the public space,
[03:34:01.920 --> 03:34:04.800]   but I don't believe that is the case with murder,
[03:34:04.800 --> 03:34:06.760]   I don't believe that is the case with violent crime,
[03:34:06.760 --> 03:34:08.600]   and it's funny you bring up Sharia,
[03:34:08.600 --> 03:34:11.120]   'cause David Friedman, when he gives--
[03:34:11.120 --> 03:34:12.280]   - Wait, I gotta ask you to clarify,
[03:34:12.280 --> 03:34:13.320]   I'm not trying to interrupt you.
[03:34:13.320 --> 03:34:15.160]   You were talking about with murder, I mean,
[03:34:15.160 --> 03:34:17.640]   you would agree, I think, just to clarify for the audience,
[03:34:17.640 --> 03:34:19.880]   that there is room for innovation in murder,
[03:34:19.880 --> 03:34:21.240]   because there's things like manslaughter,
[03:34:21.240 --> 03:34:22.320]   there's murder one, murder two.
[03:34:22.320 --> 03:34:23.160]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:34:23.160 --> 03:34:26.120]   I don't think it happens at a market level.
[03:34:26.120 --> 03:34:28.520]   I don't think there's a market innovation for murder.
[03:34:28.520 --> 03:34:30.640]   Somebody has to figure out what those standards are.
[03:34:30.640 --> 03:34:32.720]   They will evolve as we gain more knowledge.
[03:34:32.720 --> 03:34:34.880]   - But we're all agreement that the word murder
[03:34:34.880 --> 03:34:36.120]   means very different things.
[03:34:36.120 --> 03:34:38.480]   - Oh, absolutely, and if circumstances matter,
[03:34:38.480 --> 03:34:41.600]   and what are you, standards of proof,
[03:34:41.600 --> 03:34:43.400]   and standards of evidence, all of that,
[03:34:43.400 --> 03:34:45.120]   there has to be a standard. - And consequences too, yes.
[03:34:45.120 --> 03:34:46.640]   - All of that, there has to be a standard,
[03:34:46.640 --> 03:34:50.200]   and that's what I think a proper government provides.
[03:34:51.200 --> 03:34:53.240]   But, so David Friedman uses,
[03:34:53.240 --> 03:34:54.840]   in some of his talks about private law,
[03:34:54.840 --> 03:34:59.720]   he uses Sharia law in Somalia as an example.
[03:34:59.720 --> 03:35:03.680]   Look, legal systems evolve privately, independent.
[03:35:03.680 --> 03:35:05.920]   Yeah, authoritarian ones,
[03:35:05.920 --> 03:35:08.880]   ones that don't respect the rights of women at all.
[03:35:08.880 --> 03:35:10.160]   Are you married?
[03:35:10.160 --> 03:35:13.000]   - No, no, but we all wanna have sex with our mother,
[03:35:13.000 --> 03:35:14.360]   as Freud would say.
[03:35:14.360 --> 03:35:16.520]   - Oh my God, can we make that a clip?
[03:35:16.520 --> 03:35:17.360]   - Yep.
[03:35:17.360 --> 03:35:19.120]   - Where the hell did that come from?
[03:35:19.320 --> 03:35:20.240]   (laughing)
[03:35:20.240 --> 03:35:23.120]   That's much better than what I was just saying about the kids.
[03:35:23.120 --> 03:35:23.960]   - I appreciate that.
[03:35:23.960 --> 03:35:26.880]   Okay, so we went in a voluntary way,
[03:35:26.880 --> 03:35:29.400]   although sometimes for Yaron, and sometimes for Michael,
[03:35:29.400 --> 03:35:34.200]   it felt involuntary, but we all got the big guns.
[03:35:34.200 --> 03:35:37.240]   So how do we land this?
[03:35:37.240 --> 03:35:41.480]   Clearly there's a disagreement about anarchism here.
[03:35:41.480 --> 03:35:43.640]   - I think there's a big agreement,
[03:35:43.640 --> 03:35:46.000]   because if Yaron was saying that if I wanna have
[03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:48.400]   my voluntary stupid thing with you,
[03:35:48.400 --> 03:35:51.120]   and his government is not gonna tax me,
[03:35:51.120 --> 03:35:52.960]   and is not gonna insinuate itself
[03:35:52.960 --> 03:35:54.840]   unless we're murdering each other, something like that,
[03:35:54.840 --> 03:35:55.680]   I'm okay with that.
[03:35:55.680 --> 03:35:58.440]   - So if you take the example of Sharia law,
[03:35:58.440 --> 03:35:59.720]   which was mentioned earlier,
[03:35:59.720 --> 03:36:04.720]   so if you have a little community within my world,
[03:36:04.720 --> 03:36:06.780]   that imposes Sharia law,
[03:36:06.780 --> 03:36:12.240]   if it starts mutilating little girls,
[03:36:12.240 --> 03:36:15.400]   then you impose your law on it, right?
[03:36:15.400 --> 03:36:16.760]   You impose the law on it,
[03:36:16.760 --> 03:36:18.600]   because it's an issue of protecting individual rights.
[03:36:18.600 --> 03:36:22.280]   If they wanna treat women, if women have to cover up,
[03:36:22.280 --> 03:36:24.360]   and the women are okay with that, that's fine.
[03:36:24.360 --> 03:36:28.040]   If the woman wants to leave, but is not allowed to leave,
[03:36:28.040 --> 03:36:30.240]   that's where my government would step in,
[03:36:30.240 --> 03:36:35.240]   and prevent them from using force against her.
[03:36:35.240 --> 03:36:37.040]   And that's it, right?
[03:36:37.040 --> 03:36:37.880]   - Okay.
[03:36:37.880 --> 03:36:39.800]   - Now, I think it's more complicated than that, right?
[03:36:39.800 --> 03:36:42.440]   Because I think there are complex issue property rights
[03:36:42.440 --> 03:36:46.000]   often where it's not gonna be easy for you guys to resolve,
[03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:47.920]   and particularly if you interact with people
[03:36:47.920 --> 03:36:49.080]   outside of your community.
[03:36:49.080 --> 03:36:49.920]   - Sure.
[03:36:49.920 --> 03:36:54.840]   - But yeah, my view is government is there
[03:36:54.840 --> 03:36:56.960]   to protect individual rights, that's it.
[03:36:56.960 --> 03:36:58.440]   Otherwise, leave you alone.
[03:36:58.440 --> 03:37:00.760]   - I think this conversation is gonna continue
[03:37:00.760 --> 03:37:02.200]   for quite a while.
[03:37:02.200 --> 03:37:04.760]   Michael has a new book on the topic
[03:37:04.760 --> 03:37:06.640]   coming out eventually, one day.
[03:37:06.640 --> 03:37:09.800]   So you're working also on, still called The White Pill?
[03:37:09.800 --> 03:37:10.640]   - The White Pill, yeah.
[03:37:10.640 --> 03:37:13.880]   And the first line of The White Pill is,
[03:37:13.880 --> 03:37:15.800]   "Ayn Rand did not laugh."
[03:37:15.800 --> 03:37:18.480]   I'm not joking, that's literally the first line.
[03:37:18.480 --> 03:37:19.320]   - I believe you.
[03:37:19.320 --> 03:37:21.320]   - 'Cause it opens up with her,
[03:37:21.320 --> 03:37:23.080]   who knows what the book's gonna look like when it's done,
[03:37:23.080 --> 03:37:24.720]   but as of now, that's the beginning.
[03:37:24.720 --> 03:37:27.880]   'Cause it opens up with her testimony at the House
[03:37:27.880 --> 03:37:29.440]   on American Activities Committee,
[03:37:29.440 --> 03:37:33.320]   where she's trying to explain to these Congress people
[03:37:33.320 --> 03:37:36.480]   what it was like when she left the Soviet Union,
[03:37:36.480 --> 03:37:38.640]   and they are just befuddled by it.
[03:37:38.640 --> 03:37:40.560]   - Can you explain she did not laugh?
[03:37:40.560 --> 03:37:42.040]   - Well, 'cause the first line in the fountainhead,
[03:37:42.040 --> 03:37:43.840]   spoiler alert, is "Howard Rourke laughed."
[03:37:43.840 --> 03:37:45.520]   So this is a little inversion of that.
[03:37:45.520 --> 03:37:46.920]   It says, "Ayn Rand did not laugh."
[03:37:46.920 --> 03:37:48.920]   Because she had this,
[03:37:48.920 --> 03:37:52.480]   Ayn Rand was a huge fan of America, as am I.
[03:37:52.480 --> 03:37:57.360]   She took our political system very seriously.
[03:37:57.360 --> 03:38:00.000]   She had enormous reverence for institutions.
[03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:03.240]   One example of this is one of the villains
[03:38:03.240 --> 03:38:06.680]   of the Atlas Shrugged is based on Harry Truman.
[03:38:06.680 --> 03:38:08.720]   I think Thompson is the character's name.
[03:38:08.720 --> 03:38:11.040]   And because she had such respect for the name,
[03:38:11.040 --> 03:38:12.240]   for the title of president,
[03:38:12.240 --> 03:38:13.500]   she refers to him as the chairman.
[03:38:13.500 --> 03:38:14.480]   She couldn't even bring herself--
[03:38:14.480 --> 03:38:17.160]   - She had a huge respect for the presidency.
[03:38:17.160 --> 03:38:18.360]   I wonder if she'd still have it,
[03:38:18.360 --> 03:38:20.640]   given the last string of presidents we've had.
[03:38:20.640 --> 03:38:23.560]   - So having her,
[03:38:23.560 --> 03:38:25.680]   which sets up the broader point of the book,
[03:38:25.680 --> 03:38:28.480]   which I'm sure I'll be back on the show to discuss,
[03:38:28.480 --> 03:38:30.000]   assuming this bridge hasn't been burned,
[03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:32.000]   but I'll try my best.
[03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:34.320]   - All three of us are canceled.
[03:38:34.320 --> 03:38:36.080]   Some are more canceled than the others.
[03:38:36.080 --> 03:38:36.920]   - Uh-oh.
[03:38:36.920 --> 03:38:39.400]   I don't know.
[03:38:39.400 --> 03:38:41.640]   - The point being, which sets up the broader point
[03:38:41.640 --> 03:38:46.640]   of the book is how ignorant many people are in the West
[03:38:46.640 --> 03:38:50.700]   about the horrors of Stalinism and communism,
[03:38:50.700 --> 03:38:55.700]   but also how many people in the West were complicit
[03:38:55.700 --> 03:39:00.940]   in saying to Americans, "Go home, everything's fine.
[03:39:00.940 --> 03:39:02.000]   "This is great.
[03:39:02.000 --> 03:39:04.360]   "Sure, this is why Pence stopped the race.
[03:39:04.360 --> 03:39:05.840]   "They're sure there are mistakes."
[03:39:05.840 --> 03:39:08.280]   And they really made a point to downplay,
[03:39:08.280 --> 03:39:13.280]   really gratuitously, some of the unimaginable atrocities
[03:39:13.280 --> 03:39:15.200]   of the communism.
[03:39:15.200 --> 03:39:16.720]   And just one more sentence,
[03:39:16.720 --> 03:39:19.960]   and going through the work and learning
[03:39:19.960 --> 03:39:24.720]   about what they actually did is so jaw-dropping
[03:39:24.720 --> 03:39:27.560]   that it's, and if I didn't know about it,
[03:39:27.560 --> 03:39:29.400]   many people I'm friends with who are historians
[03:39:29.400 --> 03:39:30.680]   who entered the space,
[03:39:30.680 --> 03:39:32.160]   this isn't common knowledge to them,
[03:39:32.160 --> 03:39:35.080]   then we can assume that almost no one knows about it.
[03:39:35.080 --> 03:39:37.920]   And I think it's very important for people
[03:39:37.920 --> 03:39:40.920]   to appreciate whether Republican, Democrat, liberal,
[03:39:40.920 --> 03:39:44.840]   whatever, how much of a danger this is.
[03:39:44.840 --> 03:39:47.320]   And I think Americans have this,
[03:39:47.320 --> 03:39:49.120]   there's a book called "It Can't Happen Here,"
[03:39:49.120 --> 03:39:50.760]   I think by Sinclair Lewis,
[03:39:50.760 --> 03:39:52.880]   about a fascist who come to America.
[03:39:52.880 --> 03:39:55.880]   American exceptionalism has a positive context,
[03:39:55.880 --> 03:39:57.120]   but also have a negative context
[03:39:57.120 --> 03:39:59.000]   where you think we're invincible.
[03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:00.840]   All these horrible things that happen to other countries,
[03:40:00.840 --> 03:40:01.800]   it can't possibly happen here.
[03:40:01.800 --> 03:40:03.080]   We're America, we're special.
[03:40:03.080 --> 03:40:06.520]   And it's completely an absurdity.
[03:40:06.520 --> 03:40:07.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:40:07.600 --> 03:40:10.000]   Have you seen the movie, Mr. Jones?
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:12.000]   - My friend wrote it, no, I haven't,
[03:40:12.000 --> 03:40:14.400]   but Walter Duranty and his quotes,
[03:40:14.400 --> 03:40:15.960]   I have a thread on Twitter,
[03:40:15.960 --> 03:40:17.720]   Walter Duranty, for those who don't know,
[03:40:17.720 --> 03:40:20.200]   he won a Pulitzer 'cause he was
[03:40:20.200 --> 03:40:22.280]   the New York Times man in Moscow.
[03:40:22.280 --> 03:40:27.160]   And endlessly, he was talking about how great it was,
[03:40:27.160 --> 03:40:30.920]   how if you hear about this famine in Ukraine,
[03:40:30.920 --> 03:40:34.400]   this is just propaganda, I went to the villages,
[03:40:34.400 --> 03:40:36.480]   everyone's happy and fed.
[03:40:36.480 --> 03:40:38.880]   A lot of it was explicit lies.
[03:40:38.880 --> 03:40:42.000]   And when you realize you're talking about,
[03:40:42.000 --> 03:40:44.240]   let's give them the absolute benefit of the doubt,
[03:40:44.240 --> 03:40:49.240]   an accidental genocide, it's still mind boggling.
[03:40:49.240 --> 03:40:51.360]   And also, Ann Applebaum,
[03:40:51.360 --> 03:40:53.920]   who's just a phenomenal, phenomenal writer,
[03:40:53.920 --> 03:40:56.000]   she wrote a book called "Red Famine,
[03:40:56.000 --> 03:40:57.640]   "Stalin's War in Ukraine."
[03:40:57.640 --> 03:41:01.480]   And she talks about how what people in America appreciate
[03:41:01.480 --> 03:41:06.480]   is how clever in their sadism the Soviets were.
[03:41:06.480 --> 03:41:10.560]   And what they knew to do to Ukraine is everyone is starving,
[03:41:10.560 --> 03:41:13.040]   so they knew if you got some meat on your bones,
[03:41:13.040 --> 03:41:14.280]   you're hiding food.
[03:41:14.280 --> 03:41:15.800]   So they come back at night,
[03:41:15.800 --> 03:41:17.320]   take your hand, put it in the door jam,
[03:41:17.320 --> 03:41:20.280]   keep slamming the door, ransack your house.
[03:41:20.280 --> 03:41:21.840]   They didn't have to find the food,
[03:41:21.840 --> 03:41:24.040]   burn down your house, take all your clothes,
[03:41:24.040 --> 03:41:25.060]   goodbye and good luck.
[03:41:25.060 --> 03:41:26.800]   I don't recall saying good luck, yeah.
[03:41:26.800 --> 03:41:27.640]   So it's--
[03:41:27.640 --> 03:41:29.480]   - So I highly recommend the movie
[03:41:29.480 --> 03:41:31.280]   because it's very well done.
[03:41:31.280 --> 03:41:32.480]   It's very well directed.
[03:41:32.480 --> 03:41:33.880]   It's beautifully made.
[03:41:33.880 --> 03:41:36.760]   It's stunningly effective.
[03:41:36.760 --> 03:41:37.600]   - Okay, good.
[03:41:37.600 --> 03:41:38.440]   - In illustrating exactly that.
[03:41:38.440 --> 03:41:41.120]   The scenes in Ukraine during the famine,
[03:41:41.120 --> 03:41:44.240]   oh, your heart goes, I mean, it's crushing.
[03:41:44.240 --> 03:41:45.560]   And it shifts to black and white.
[03:41:45.560 --> 03:41:48.240]   It's very, very well made aesthetically,
[03:41:48.240 --> 03:41:49.280]   so highly recommend it.
[03:41:49.280 --> 03:41:50.560]   - And it's written by Andrzej Chalupa.
[03:41:50.560 --> 03:41:52.700]   She's a Ukrainian friend of mine.
[03:41:52.700 --> 03:41:53.880]   She introduced me, Janmi Park,
[03:41:53.880 --> 03:41:56.480]   who's a big North Korean defector.
[03:41:56.480 --> 03:41:59.680]   And this is the kind of thing
[03:41:59.680 --> 03:42:01.160]   where I think more people need to,
[03:42:01.160 --> 03:42:02.960]   when I wrote "The New Right,"
[03:42:02.960 --> 03:42:05.320]   which talks a lot about the Nazis
[03:42:05.320 --> 03:42:06.680]   or the kind of neo-Nazis,
[03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:08.480]   one of their big complaints about,
[03:42:08.480 --> 03:42:10.200]   against people who are Jewish is like,
[03:42:10.200 --> 03:42:12.440]   oh, we hear all about the Holocaust.
[03:42:12.440 --> 03:42:13.680]   How come you don't talk about the Holodomor?
[03:42:13.680 --> 03:42:15.160]   I'm like, I'm trying to do my part.
[03:42:15.160 --> 03:42:17.480]   I agree with you that we need to be talking
[03:42:17.480 --> 03:42:19.200]   about the Holodomor. - Absolutely, absolutely.
[03:42:19.200 --> 03:42:22.480]   And it's sad there are more movies that are anti-Soviet,
[03:42:22.480 --> 03:42:26.280]   which tells you a lot about the view of the intelligentsia.
[03:42:26.280 --> 03:42:29.000]   It's a great idea, it just was badly implemented.
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:30.280]   And no, it's a rotten idea.
[03:42:30.280 --> 03:42:31.320]   It's an evil idea.
[03:42:31.320 --> 03:42:32.280]   And it was implemented-- - Which was correctly
[03:42:32.280 --> 03:42:33.120]   implemented. - Exactly.
[03:42:33.120 --> 03:42:35.360]   It was implemented exactly how it has to be implemented.
[03:42:35.360 --> 03:42:36.520]   There's no alternative.
[03:42:36.520 --> 03:42:40.720]   - Can we talk about "The Fountainhead" and "Atlas Shrugged,"
[03:42:40.720 --> 03:42:45.600]   and which character do you find most fascinating,
[03:42:45.600 --> 03:42:48.600]   ones that kind of you meet in your own mind,
[03:42:48.600 --> 03:42:50.040]   that you almost have conversations with,
[03:42:50.040 --> 03:42:52.800]   or has an influence on you and your life in general?
[03:42:52.800 --> 03:42:55.280]   - You know what character I like?
[03:42:55.280 --> 03:42:56.600]   'Cause I know no-- - Good or bad, sorry.
[03:42:56.600 --> 03:42:58.280]   - No one ever gives this answer,
[03:42:58.280 --> 03:43:01.080]   but this is my, just aesthetically,
[03:43:01.080 --> 03:43:03.040]   you know how sometimes you're drawn to a character
[03:43:03.040 --> 03:43:04.680]   and it's, if this person were real,
[03:43:04.680 --> 03:43:06.000]   you'd think they're just,
[03:43:06.000 --> 03:43:07.440]   but there's something about the resonates with you.
[03:43:07.440 --> 03:43:08.840]   I can't even explain this,
[03:43:08.840 --> 03:43:12.120]   but I love the character in "Atlas Shrugged"
[03:43:12.120 --> 03:43:14.880]   of Lillian Riordan, who's Hank Riordan's wife.
[03:43:14.880 --> 03:43:17.280]   And what is amazing about her,
[03:43:17.280 --> 03:43:20.280]   she says she's his wife, he's this big industrialist,
[03:43:20.280 --> 03:43:23.920]   innovator, and she's this like former beauty,
[03:43:23.920 --> 03:43:28.920]   but she's so cold and soulless that there's,
[03:43:28.920 --> 03:43:31.960]   I mean, I joke about, you know, Anne Rand's vampire novels,
[03:43:31.960 --> 03:43:35.120]   that character is as close to a literal vampire
[03:43:35.120 --> 03:43:36.720]   as you're gonna see in "Rand."
[03:43:36.720 --> 03:43:39.680]   And there's just this great scene
[03:43:39.680 --> 03:43:42.160]   where, you know, Hank Riordan invents Riordan Metal.
[03:43:42.160 --> 03:43:43.960]   It's this great metal, which is extremely strong,
[03:43:43.960 --> 03:43:45.680]   but extremely, it's like light,
[03:43:45.680 --> 03:43:47.880]   so this creates all these innovations.
[03:43:47.880 --> 03:43:50.400]   And he brings her a bracelet
[03:43:50.400 --> 03:43:52.040]   made of the first Riordan Metal.
[03:43:52.040 --> 03:43:53.360]   This is his life goal.
[03:43:53.360 --> 03:43:55.440]   This is like Prometheus bringing fire.
[03:43:55.440 --> 03:43:57.600]   And she's like, "What the fuck is this?"
[03:43:57.600 --> 03:43:58.520]   - It could've brought me diamonds.
[03:43:58.520 --> 03:43:59.360]   - Yeah, it could've brought me diamonds.
[03:43:59.360 --> 03:44:00.240]   What is this shit?
[03:44:00.240 --> 03:44:02.320]   And Dagny, who's another industrialist,
[03:44:02.320 --> 03:44:04.560]   she's a heroine, a very strong female character
[03:44:04.560 --> 03:44:06.480]   in "Atlas Shrugged," is at a party,
[03:44:06.480 --> 03:44:08.560]   and she goes, "I got diamonds, let's trade."
[03:44:08.560 --> 03:44:10.640]   And Lillian's like, "You want this?"
[03:44:10.640 --> 03:44:12.640]   And she's like, "Yes, 'cause that's the concretization
[03:44:12.640 --> 03:44:13.480]   "of the human mind.
[03:44:13.480 --> 03:44:14.640]   "These are rocks."
[03:44:14.640 --> 03:44:16.800]   And Lillian's like, "Okay, whatever."
[03:44:16.800 --> 03:44:21.120]   And that character is someone
[03:44:21.120 --> 03:44:23.720]   who has a lot of resonance in our culture,
[03:44:23.720 --> 03:44:25.480]   this kind of soulless.
[03:44:25.480 --> 03:44:29.120]   It's easy to write a soulless male figure,
[03:44:29.120 --> 03:44:31.520]   like Peter Keating, in some ways, is soulless,
[03:44:31.520 --> 03:44:36.240]   but that, for some reason, when it's like a soulless female,
[03:44:36.240 --> 03:44:40.080]   it seems that much more chilling and effective.
[03:44:40.080 --> 03:44:41.800]   Do you not agree, though, that Lillian Riordan
[03:44:41.800 --> 03:44:43.440]   is an amazingly, very powerful figure?
[03:44:43.440 --> 03:44:44.400]   - Powerful figure.
[03:44:44.400 --> 03:44:47.120]   And I think Riordan is, too.
[03:44:47.120 --> 03:44:50.560]   And what I love about Riordan is his evolution, right?
[03:44:51.120 --> 03:44:52.440]   He's so flawed.
[03:44:52.440 --> 03:44:54.360]   He's a hero who's completely flawed.
[03:44:54.360 --> 03:44:56.440]   And it drives me nuts when people say,
[03:44:56.440 --> 03:44:59.200]   "Her characters are cartoonish, they never change,
[03:44:59.200 --> 03:45:01.080]   "there's no emotion."
[03:45:01.080 --> 03:45:01.920]   Really?
[03:45:01.920 --> 03:45:03.400]   Did you read the same book I did?
[03:45:03.400 --> 03:45:05.800]   'Cause if you take Riordan, and he's struggling,
[03:45:05.800 --> 03:45:07.720]   and he's trying to deal with Lillian, and his family,
[03:45:07.720 --> 03:45:10.480]   and all this stuff, and we know family members like this,
[03:45:10.480 --> 03:45:14.240]   right, I mean, who are leeches and parasites,
[03:45:14.240 --> 03:45:15.440]   but he's excusing them,
[03:45:15.440 --> 03:45:17.080]   'cause that's what he's supposed to do.
[03:45:17.080 --> 03:45:20.520]   And then as he evolves to fully realize,
[03:45:20.520 --> 03:45:24.040]   what's going on, that evolution is difficult, it's hard.
[03:45:24.040 --> 03:45:26.040]   Like the scene after he has sex with Dagny,
[03:45:26.040 --> 03:45:28.360]   of course he gives a speech, but the speech is,
[03:45:28.360 --> 03:45:29.760]   (laughing)
[03:45:29.760 --> 03:45:32.480]   it's such a good speech in terms of conveying
[03:45:32.480 --> 03:45:34.360]   his mind-body split, right?
[03:45:34.360 --> 03:45:37.520]   He thinks he really had fun, he really enjoyed the sex,
[03:45:37.520 --> 03:45:40.040]   right, but he thinks it's animalistic,
[03:45:40.040 --> 03:45:42.040]   and he thinks it's a sign of his depravity,
[03:45:42.040 --> 03:45:44.800]   and he thinks, and here he is, this woman he loves,
[03:45:44.800 --> 03:45:46.320]   and he adores her, and--
[03:45:46.320 --> 03:45:47.160]   - And this is not the one.
[03:45:47.160 --> 03:45:48.720]   - And he can't, yeah, and he can't connect the two,
[03:45:48.720 --> 03:45:50.360]   he can't connect the sex with the love.
[03:45:50.360 --> 03:45:52.480]   He can't connect the sex with adoration,
[03:45:52.480 --> 03:45:53.520]   and with the value.
[03:45:53.520 --> 03:45:56.560]   So her characters are anything I think,
[03:45:56.560 --> 03:45:59.720]   but cardboard characters, because I think Dagny,
[03:45:59.720 --> 03:46:02.400]   and the scenes where she's listening to music,
[03:46:02.400 --> 03:46:04.760]   and gets captured by the music,
[03:46:04.760 --> 03:46:06.960]   and the way Ren describes that,
[03:46:06.960 --> 03:46:08.080]   I think it's just beautiful.
[03:46:08.080 --> 03:46:10.760]   Or the scene, my favorite scene in "Atlas"
[03:46:10.760 --> 03:46:15.120]   is the scene where they're crossing,
[03:46:15.120 --> 03:46:16.880]   where they're taking the first train ride
[03:46:16.880 --> 03:46:18.200]   across the John Gold Bridge.
[03:46:18.200 --> 03:46:19.600]   - Oh yeah, the end of Act One.
[03:46:19.600 --> 03:46:21.560]   - And she's, they're in the engine room,
[03:46:21.560 --> 03:46:23.120]   and it's traveling through.
[03:46:23.120 --> 03:46:25.840]   And the way she's describing Dagny,
[03:46:25.840 --> 03:46:28.680]   and it's almost like Dagny's having sex with the machine.
[03:46:28.680 --> 03:46:32.640]   It's so powerful emotionally, the success,
[03:46:32.640 --> 03:46:34.480]   the fact that they did it.
[03:46:34.480 --> 03:46:36.360]   Everybody told them it was impossible,
[03:46:36.360 --> 03:46:38.240]   and the train is going really fast,
[03:46:38.240 --> 03:46:43.240]   and that whole, it's got a sexual vibe to it.
[03:46:43.240 --> 03:46:46.560]   It's all about passion, it's all about success,
[03:46:46.560 --> 03:46:48.760]   and it's all about the success of their minds,
[03:46:48.760 --> 03:46:50.360]   and nobody else matters.
[03:46:50.360 --> 03:46:52.560]   - What's really great about that scene,
[03:46:52.560 --> 03:46:54.560]   just in terms of constructing the novel,
[03:46:54.560 --> 03:46:56.120]   I'm not going to spoil anything.
[03:46:56.120 --> 03:46:58.480]   So "The Atlas Shrugged" has three acts,
[03:46:58.480 --> 03:47:00.680]   like three act structure is not uncommon.
[03:47:00.680 --> 03:47:03.560]   And the first act is about Hank Reardon,
[03:47:03.560 --> 03:47:05.360]   overcoming all this adversity at home,
[03:47:05.360 --> 03:47:07.760]   in his personal life, and in his business,
[03:47:07.760 --> 03:47:09.840]   to create this great achievement.
[03:47:09.840 --> 03:47:12.640]   So Rand really makes the reader invested
[03:47:12.640 --> 03:47:14.600]   in this character and his accomplishments.
[03:47:14.600 --> 03:47:17.320]   He's unambiguously doing something good.
[03:47:17.320 --> 03:47:19.120]   There's no downside here.
[03:47:19.120 --> 03:47:22.240]   He's making it easier to transport people, transport food.
[03:47:22.240 --> 03:47:23.920]   This is really just great.
[03:47:23.920 --> 03:47:26.960]   And it's just, once you read it and you look back,
[03:47:26.960 --> 03:47:30.720]   you're like, she does such a masterful job of making,
[03:47:30.720 --> 03:47:33.360]   you have to be a fan of this person and root for them.
[03:47:33.360 --> 03:47:35.240]   'Cause she's like, "Oh, you think things are going great?
[03:47:35.240 --> 03:47:36.520]   "He's overcome?
[03:47:36.520 --> 03:47:37.480]   "Hold on a minute."
[03:47:37.480 --> 03:47:39.480]   And then the rest of it, she's just real.
[03:47:39.480 --> 03:47:44.480]   And your sense of injustice is triggered as a reader
[03:47:44.480 --> 03:47:45.960]   to such an nth degree,
[03:47:45.960 --> 03:47:48.560]   because you saw what he went through to get to this point,
[03:47:48.560 --> 03:47:51.520]   and now you're seeing it taking away people inferior to him.
[03:47:51.520 --> 03:47:54.360]   And one of the quotes on Twitter I use all the time
[03:47:54.360 --> 03:47:59.200]   is I'll see someone, politician or a bureaucrat or a thinker,
[03:47:59.200 --> 03:48:02.560]   just advocate for something completely unconscionable.
[03:48:02.560 --> 03:48:04.120]   And I'll just quote and say,
[03:48:04.120 --> 03:48:06.560]   "My favorite criticism of Ayn Rand
[03:48:06.560 --> 03:48:07.960]   "is that they say her villains
[03:48:07.960 --> 03:48:09.800]   "are too evil and unrealistic."
[03:48:09.800 --> 03:48:13.080]   Because the things that people posit with a straight face
[03:48:13.080 --> 03:48:16.600]   are so much worse than she has in her book.
[03:48:16.600 --> 03:48:18.840]   - And not just politicians, you find intellectuals today.
[03:48:18.840 --> 03:48:19.680]   - Oh, of course.
[03:48:19.680 --> 03:48:21.800]   - Way over the top.
[03:48:21.800 --> 03:48:24.000]   Even when I read Atlas Shrugged, I was going,
[03:48:24.000 --> 03:48:25.560]   "Nobody really talks like this."
[03:48:25.560 --> 03:48:26.480]   No, they do.
[03:48:26.480 --> 03:48:28.080]   - Let me give you one example.
[03:48:28.080 --> 03:48:30.440]   There was a story she wrote, which she never published.
[03:48:30.440 --> 03:48:33.280]   They published her journals, the Ayn Rand Institute.
[03:48:33.280 --> 03:48:34.640]   And there was one character,
[03:48:34.640 --> 03:48:36.440]   and this was a prototype of Ellsworth Tewi,
[03:48:36.440 --> 03:48:39.440]   he was one of the villains of "The Fountainhead."
[03:48:39.440 --> 03:48:41.960]   And basically the kid had deformed legs
[03:48:41.960 --> 03:48:43.520]   or broke his legs or something like that.
[03:48:43.520 --> 03:48:45.520]   And he wants to get leg braces.
[03:48:45.520 --> 03:48:47.560]   And the dad is like, "Oh, we're not gonna do that.
[03:48:47.560 --> 03:48:49.280]   "Why should you be better than anyone else?
[03:48:49.280 --> 03:48:50.600]   "You should just have deformity."
[03:48:50.600 --> 03:48:51.440]   - Accept your fate.
[03:48:51.440 --> 03:48:52.280]   - Accept your fate.
[03:48:52.280 --> 03:48:53.520]   And you're reading this, and I'm like,
[03:48:53.520 --> 03:48:56.200]   "What dad is not going to give his kid leg braces?
[03:48:56.200 --> 03:48:57.280]   "It's ridiculous."
[03:48:57.280 --> 03:49:00.640]   But now it's not uncommon for deaf children
[03:49:00.640 --> 03:49:04.560]   to not get cochlear implants and not be able to hear
[03:49:04.560 --> 03:49:05.840]   'cause their parents say,
[03:49:05.840 --> 03:49:08.240]   "Well, we're gonna lose deaf culture."
[03:49:08.240 --> 03:49:09.520]   Hearing is just information.
[03:49:09.520 --> 03:49:10.560]   And you're sitting there,
[03:49:10.560 --> 03:49:11.920]   and whether you agree with this or not,
[03:49:11.920 --> 03:49:14.800]   this is very close to what she was saying.
[03:49:14.800 --> 03:49:16.200]   And when I read what she was saying,
[03:49:16.200 --> 03:49:18.720]   I'm like, "Okay, crazy Ayn Rand, this is not a thing."
[03:49:18.720 --> 03:49:20.840]   And it's like, "Oh, yeah, the craziness
[03:49:20.840 --> 03:49:22.840]   "is that it's not braces, it's hearing."
[03:49:22.840 --> 03:49:26.080]   - Yeah, and what evil to deny your kid hearing?
[03:49:26.080 --> 03:49:27.640]   I mean, God.
[03:49:27.640 --> 03:49:28.880]   - So here's the other thing.
[03:49:28.880 --> 03:49:29.880]   If you want deaf culture,
[03:49:29.880 --> 03:49:32.160]   which I would believe is a thing, sign language, whatever,
[03:49:32.160 --> 03:49:33.240]   they could turn it off.
[03:49:33.240 --> 03:49:35.280]   Yeah, if you want, give them the choice.
[03:49:35.280 --> 03:49:38.920]   Tonight, I'm sorry, one more thing.
[03:49:38.920 --> 03:49:41.600]   You know, Rand used the word evil frequently.
[03:49:41.600 --> 03:49:43.720]   And I think maybe I can make the argument
[03:49:43.720 --> 03:49:45.200]   she used it too loosely.
[03:49:45.200 --> 03:49:48.440]   If you are denying a child the gift of music,
[03:49:48.440 --> 03:49:49.440]   I will say that's evil.
[03:49:49.440 --> 03:49:50.880]   - I agree, completely.
[03:49:50.880 --> 03:49:51.920]   - Unambiguously.
[03:49:51.920 --> 03:49:57.840]   Go online and watch videos of people getting hearing aids
[03:49:57.840 --> 03:49:59.880]   and being able to hear for the first time.
[03:49:59.880 --> 03:50:00.720]   - And seeing what happens to their faces.
[03:50:00.720 --> 03:50:02.920]   - I promise you, you will cry
[03:50:02.920 --> 03:50:06.360]   because there's no pure, I'm getting teared up right now.
[03:50:06.360 --> 03:50:09.480]   There's no pure expression of humanity
[03:50:09.480 --> 03:50:11.360]   and technology at its best
[03:50:11.360 --> 03:50:14.040]   than seeing a two-year-old or one and a half-year-old
[03:50:14.040 --> 03:50:15.360]   who can't even talk.
[03:50:15.360 --> 03:50:17.480]   And then you see the reaction when they hear mom's voice.
[03:50:17.480 --> 03:50:20.240]   It's so beautiful and moving.
[03:50:20.240 --> 03:50:21.160]   - Absolutely.
[03:50:21.160 --> 03:50:22.720]   - Yeah, there's a few things that's moving.
[03:50:22.720 --> 03:50:26.360]   It's like, it's one of the ways
[03:50:26.360 --> 03:50:28.160]   to rethink technology, perhaps.
[03:50:28.160 --> 03:50:29.960]   - And there's this, it's really funny
[03:50:29.960 --> 03:50:32.400]   'cause sometimes it'll be this tough dude, right?
[03:50:32.400 --> 03:50:33.920]   And he's been deaf all his life.
[03:50:33.920 --> 03:50:35.240]   And then they put hearing in,
[03:50:35.240 --> 03:50:36.640]   the girlfriend's like, "Can you hear me?"
[03:50:36.640 --> 03:50:38.160]   And he's trying to be tough for three seconds.
[03:50:38.160 --> 03:50:39.920]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, he just loses his grip.
[03:50:39.920 --> 03:50:41.640]   And you just sit there, it's just this.
[03:50:41.640 --> 03:50:44.080]   - No, absolutely, and that's true of any sense.
[03:50:44.080 --> 03:50:46.240]   - Like colorblind people seeing color for the first time,
[03:50:46.240 --> 03:50:47.080]   that kind of thing.
[03:50:47.080 --> 03:50:47.920]   I think there's a few.
[03:50:47.920 --> 03:50:50.760]   - It's not quite the same, but it's somewhat.
[03:50:50.760 --> 03:50:53.200]   But if you're blind and suddenly can see,
[03:50:53.200 --> 03:50:55.120]   I mean, it's just stunning.
[03:50:55.120 --> 03:50:57.160]   I mean, and how do we form our concepts?
[03:50:57.160 --> 03:50:58.000]   How do we think?
[03:50:58.000 --> 03:51:00.760]   We have to, we get information from reality, right?
[03:51:00.760 --> 03:51:04.120]   We interact with reality through our senses
[03:51:04.120 --> 03:51:06.680]   and that's how we become conceptual beings.
[03:51:06.680 --> 03:51:09.600]   And you deny an element of that from a human being.
[03:51:09.600 --> 03:51:10.480]   That is horrible.
[03:51:10.480 --> 03:51:12.880]   - There's a potential that would then neural link to,
[03:51:12.880 --> 03:51:14.520]   so further developments there.
[03:51:14.520 --> 03:51:17.760]   So, I mean, on that, there's a powerful question
[03:51:17.760 --> 03:51:19.640]   of who is John Galt?
[03:51:19.640 --> 03:51:21.320]   I don't know if we can do this without spoiler alerts.
[03:51:21.320 --> 03:51:22.400]   - Yeah, don't spoil the book.
[03:51:22.400 --> 03:51:23.240]   - Okay.
[03:51:23.240 --> 03:51:24.480]   - But you can say--
[03:51:24.480 --> 03:51:26.320]   - What's the importance of this character?
[03:51:26.320 --> 03:51:27.640]   What's the importance of this question?
[03:51:27.640 --> 03:51:29.080]   - I mean, without the importance of,
[03:51:29.080 --> 03:51:31.400]   so I once gave a talk on who is John Galt.
[03:51:31.400 --> 03:51:32.960]   And who is John Galt in a sense
[03:51:32.960 --> 03:51:35.360]   is anybody who takes their own life seriously.
[03:51:35.360 --> 03:51:39.360]   Anybody who's willing to really live fully their own life,
[03:51:39.360 --> 03:51:42.120]   use their mind in pursuit of their rational values
[03:51:42.120 --> 03:51:45.840]   and pursue their happiness fully uncompromisingly
[03:51:45.840 --> 03:51:50.840]   with no compromise and sticking to their integrity.
[03:51:50.840 --> 03:51:55.080]   Anybody can be John Galt in that sense.
[03:51:55.080 --> 03:52:00.080]   - I think one of the mottos I live by is all,
[03:52:00.080 --> 03:52:02.880]   we are tasked to, maybe this is a little bit religious,
[03:52:02.880 --> 03:52:04.280]   but I think your own is gonna agree with it.
[03:52:04.280 --> 03:52:05.640]   I'm sure you'll agree with it.
[03:52:05.640 --> 03:52:08.120]   All any of us can do is leave the world
[03:52:08.120 --> 03:52:10.280]   a little bit of a better place than we found it.
[03:52:10.280 --> 03:52:12.480]   And I think if you do that through hard work,
[03:52:12.480 --> 03:52:16.280]   being honest, being not at the expense of other people,
[03:52:16.280 --> 03:52:19.680]   you can go to your grave patting yourself on the back.
[03:52:19.680 --> 03:52:23.040]   - I mean, to me, the leaving the world a better place,
[03:52:23.040 --> 03:52:27.040]   yeah, I mean, that's not what drives me.
[03:52:27.040 --> 03:52:29.760]   What drives me is, I mean, what I think drives people.
[03:52:29.760 --> 03:52:31.760]   I think just live a good life.
[03:52:31.760 --> 03:52:34.720]   And good life means a life you're happy living.
[03:52:34.720 --> 03:52:37.880]   And part of that is the impact you have on the world,
[03:52:37.880 --> 03:52:41.480]   but it's, so many people live wasted lives,
[03:52:41.480 --> 03:52:44.960]   live mediocre lives, live conventional lives.
[03:52:44.960 --> 03:52:46.560]   Maybe they even leave the world a better place,
[03:52:46.560 --> 03:52:48.880]   but they didn't really, they didn't--
[03:52:48.880 --> 03:52:50.080]   - But they didn't leave the world a better place.
[03:52:50.080 --> 03:52:51.320]   - They left the world a better place,
[03:52:51.320 --> 03:52:55.720]   but they didn't live their potential.
[03:52:55.720 --> 03:52:59.160]   They didn't, or they died feeling guilty about it,
[03:52:59.160 --> 03:53:01.440]   or they, a million different things.
[03:53:01.440 --> 03:53:02.880]   So there's so many productive people.
[03:53:02.880 --> 03:53:04.360]   I mean, think about all the innovators
[03:53:04.360 --> 03:53:06.600]   and the technologists and the businessmen
[03:53:06.600 --> 03:53:08.960]   who leave the world a better place by a big shot,
[03:53:08.960 --> 03:53:12.360]   but are never happy, never happy in their own souls,
[03:53:12.360 --> 03:53:14.120]   in their own life.
[03:53:14.120 --> 03:53:16.000]   And to me, that's what counts.
[03:53:16.000 --> 03:53:17.080]   And if you're gonna be happy,
[03:53:17.080 --> 03:53:17.920]   you'll leave the better world a better place.
[03:53:17.920 --> 03:53:20.160]   - And that's what John Vaught symbolizes.
[03:53:20.160 --> 03:53:24.120]   - To me, it's living your life by your standards,
[03:53:24.120 --> 03:53:29.120]   by your values, and pursuing that happiness.
[03:53:29.120 --> 03:53:32.360]   - Well, I take, I'm sorry, I take in a different context,
[03:53:32.360 --> 03:53:33.400]   'cause I think a lot of,
[03:53:33.400 --> 03:53:35.000]   and I don't think you're gonna disagree with this.
[03:53:35.000 --> 03:53:36.600]   I think a lot of times when you're young,
[03:53:36.600 --> 03:53:38.120]   you have unrealistic expectations
[03:53:38.120 --> 03:53:39.320]   about what you're gonna accomplish.
[03:53:39.320 --> 03:53:40.240]   And you think to yourself,
[03:53:40.240 --> 03:53:42.280]   well, let's suppose someone wants to go into politics.
[03:53:42.280 --> 03:53:44.320]   Well, if I'm not elected president, I'm a failure.
[03:53:44.320 --> 03:53:45.200]   That's nonsensical.
[03:53:45.200 --> 03:53:46.640]   There's lots of people who are successful
[03:53:46.640 --> 03:53:49.480]   who haven't achieved literally the top position in their role.
[03:53:49.480 --> 03:53:51.400]   So if you can go to your grave,
[03:53:51.400 --> 03:53:53.280]   having defending everything you've done,
[03:53:53.280 --> 03:53:54.120]   and you've moved the needle in a pot--
[03:53:54.120 --> 03:53:56.160]   - Yes, successes should not be relative.
[03:53:56.160 --> 03:53:57.000]   - Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[03:53:57.000 --> 03:53:58.000]   - So that goes back to second-handedness.
[03:53:58.000 --> 03:53:58.840]   - Yes.
[03:53:58.840 --> 03:54:00.520]   - Success is not being better than other people.
[03:54:00.520 --> 03:54:02.920]   Success is not being the best.
[03:54:02.920 --> 03:54:06.000]   Success is maximizing your potential, whatever that is.
[03:54:06.000 --> 03:54:08.960]   And look, I know people,
[03:54:08.960 --> 03:54:13.840]   I have a son who could be a really good engineer,
[03:54:13.840 --> 03:54:15.480]   really good mathematician, really good scientist,
[03:54:15.480 --> 03:54:18.780]   but he decided he wants to write comedy, right?
[03:54:18.780 --> 03:54:20.960]   So he might've been a better mathematician
[03:54:20.960 --> 03:54:22.720]   than he is a comedian, but that's his values.
[03:54:22.720 --> 03:54:24.240]   That's his goals.
[03:54:24.240 --> 03:54:25.560]   That's what he wants to do.
[03:54:25.560 --> 03:54:27.600]   And hopefully he'll be really, really good at that.
[03:54:27.600 --> 03:54:29.760]   And he'll be incredibly successful at it
[03:54:29.760 --> 03:54:31.680]   and materially in every other sense.
[03:54:31.680 --> 03:54:33.920]   But that's what you pursue.
[03:54:33.920 --> 03:54:34.760]   - Yeah.
[03:54:34.760 --> 03:54:39.120]   - So it's really being true to yourself in a deep sense.
[03:54:39.120 --> 03:54:41.320]   And if you are true to yourself,
[03:54:41.320 --> 03:54:42.760]   yeah, you'll leave the world a better place,
[03:54:42.760 --> 03:54:44.160]   but that's not the essence.
[03:54:44.160 --> 03:54:45.520]   The essence is you.
[03:54:45.520 --> 03:54:47.120]   No, focus on you.
[03:54:47.120 --> 03:54:49.920]   Focus on making your life the best life that it can be.
[03:54:49.920 --> 03:54:51.800]   And if you do that,
[03:54:51.800 --> 03:54:55.120]   you'll make the world a better place almost by definition.
[03:54:55.120 --> 03:54:55.960]   - But yeah.
[03:54:55.960 --> 03:54:57.120]   - You'll impact people.
[03:54:57.120 --> 03:54:59.800]   - We're looking at the same thing in different ways.
[03:54:59.800 --> 03:55:02.480]   It's at least in my little corner of the world,
[03:55:02.480 --> 03:55:06.640]   it was disappointing how rare that is.
[03:55:06.640 --> 03:55:09.280]   So one of the reasons I'm here in Austin
[03:55:09.280 --> 03:55:14.280]   and one of the reasons my work gravitated towards Elon Musk
[03:55:14.280 --> 03:55:19.680]   is because he represents that person for me
[03:55:19.680 --> 03:55:21.040]   in the world of technology,
[03:55:21.040 --> 03:55:23.680]   in the world of CEO, in the world of business.
[03:55:23.680 --> 03:55:25.400]   It was very surprising to me.
[03:55:25.400 --> 03:55:28.560]   The more I've learned about the world of tech,
[03:55:28.560 --> 03:55:32.760]   how few people live unapologetically,
[03:55:32.760 --> 03:55:35.560]   fully to their potential.
[03:55:35.560 --> 03:55:37.840]   I'm sure people, others do that,
[03:55:37.840 --> 03:55:39.640]   maybe music and art, I'm not sure.
[03:55:39.640 --> 03:55:40.920]   I don't know about those worlds.
[03:55:40.920 --> 03:55:43.160]   I do know about the technology world.
[03:55:43.160 --> 03:55:44.560]   And it was disappointing to me
[03:55:44.560 --> 03:55:48.360]   how many people compromise their integrity
[03:55:48.360 --> 03:55:49.980]   in subtle ways at first,
[03:55:49.980 --> 03:55:51.520]   but then it becomes a slippery slope.
[03:55:51.520 --> 03:55:53.040]   - Can I say this?
[03:55:53.040 --> 03:55:53.920]   There's this great quote,
[03:55:53.920 --> 03:55:56.800]   and I always forget if it's Steinbecker, Hemingway,
[03:55:56.800 --> 03:55:58.440]   and the quote, and this applies for money,
[03:55:58.440 --> 03:56:00.800]   it applies for morality.
[03:56:00.800 --> 03:56:03.220]   The quote was, "How did you go bankrupt?"
[03:56:03.220 --> 03:56:06.400]   And he says, "Two ways, gradually and then suddenly."
[03:56:06.400 --> 03:56:08.640]   It's very hard to one day be like,
[03:56:08.640 --> 03:56:10.120]   "I have no integrity."
[03:56:10.120 --> 03:56:11.160]   That doesn't happen.
[03:56:11.160 --> 03:56:13.260]   It's very easy if it's like,
[03:56:13.260 --> 03:56:15.560]   "Look, I stole this candy bar.
[03:56:15.560 --> 03:56:17.840]   "What's the big deal if I steal this thing?"
[03:56:17.840 --> 03:56:18.680]   Then you're still--
[03:56:18.680 --> 03:56:20.540]   - People say there are no slippery slopes.
[03:56:20.540 --> 03:56:23.200]   There are, and they're big, and they're very slippery.
[03:56:23.200 --> 03:56:25.080]   And people slide-- - This is the biggest one.
[03:56:25.080 --> 03:56:27.760]   - And people violate their integrity even without stealing.
[03:56:27.760 --> 03:56:30.000]   Just little things about how they treat other people,
[03:56:30.000 --> 03:56:32.480]   how they treat themselves, the values they pursue.
[03:56:32.480 --> 03:56:34.680]   They don't go after the profession they really wanted to.
[03:56:34.680 --> 03:56:37.400]   They compromise in ways that they shouldn't
[03:56:37.400 --> 03:56:39.960]   with their spouse or with their mothers or whatever.
[03:56:39.960 --> 03:56:40.800]   - They look the other way when they see injustice.
[03:56:40.800 --> 03:56:42.680]   - And then they wake up one day when they're 40.
[03:56:42.680 --> 03:56:47.280]   And this is why people go through midlife crisis.
[03:56:47.280 --> 03:56:50.320]   Midlife crisis is a crisis where you suddenly realize,
[03:56:50.320 --> 03:56:51.160]   "I didn't do it.
[03:56:51.160 --> 03:56:52.840]   "I didn't live up to my standards.
[03:56:52.840 --> 03:56:55.920]   "I didn't live up to my youthful idealism.
[03:56:55.920 --> 03:56:57.760]   "I compromised and I sold out."
[03:56:57.760 --> 03:57:00.240]   But I also would warn you about Silicon Valley.
[03:57:00.240 --> 03:57:05.120]   Yeah, I think at the top, very few of them stick to it.
[03:57:05.120 --> 03:57:08.640]   And partially, it's the political pressure is unbearable.
[03:57:08.640 --> 03:57:09.480]   I mean, how would you?
[03:57:09.480 --> 03:57:10.400]   How can you?
[03:57:10.400 --> 03:57:13.620]   It would require to be a hero, and very few of them are.
[03:57:13.620 --> 03:57:16.380]   But there are a lot of people who do really well
[03:57:16.380 --> 03:57:18.240]   at all kinds of levels in technology,
[03:57:18.240 --> 03:57:20.040]   who little startups, people.
[03:57:20.040 --> 03:57:21.320]   And this is the point Michael was making.
[03:57:21.320 --> 03:57:22.480]   You don't have to be the best.
[03:57:22.480 --> 03:57:23.680]   - Yeah.
[03:57:23.680 --> 03:57:27.560]   - You don't have to be a CEO to lift your max
[03:57:27.560 --> 03:57:30.920]   and to live with integrity and to live a great life.
[03:57:30.920 --> 03:57:33.680]   I know people who do, because they joined Amazon
[03:57:33.680 --> 03:57:36.520]   or whatever, have just made a life for themselves,
[03:57:36.520 --> 03:57:38.280]   an amazing life for themselves,
[03:57:38.280 --> 03:57:41.400]   and have done great work at Amazon, let's say,
[03:57:41.400 --> 03:57:43.120]   and then have lived a great life
[03:57:43.120 --> 03:57:45.620]   because of the opportunity that created for them.
[03:57:45.620 --> 03:57:48.680]   So I think there are more good people out there,
[03:57:48.680 --> 03:57:52.680]   but yes, one of the saddest things of growing up
[03:57:52.680 --> 03:57:57.400]   is even when you're a teenager and looking at adults
[03:57:57.400 --> 03:58:00.200]   and noticing how few of them actually live,
[03:58:00.200 --> 03:58:04.360]   I mean, are really alive in a sense of living their values
[03:58:04.360 --> 03:58:05.200]   and enjoying their life.
[03:58:05.200 --> 03:58:06.520]   And you start with your parents,
[03:58:06.520 --> 03:58:08.520]   and you look across the people,
[03:58:08.520 --> 03:58:10.920]   everybody lives such mediocre lives.
[03:58:10.920 --> 03:58:13.320]   - Yeah, and the other thing is they don't have to.
[03:58:13.320 --> 03:58:15.160]   That's what people don't appreciate.
[03:58:15.160 --> 03:58:16.840]   - Particularly not in the world that we live in today
[03:58:16.840 --> 03:58:17.880]   that's so wealthy.
[03:58:17.880 --> 03:58:20.400]   And we all have so many opportunities, right?
[03:58:20.400 --> 03:58:22.640]   - So by way of advice,
[03:58:22.640 --> 03:58:25.880]   what advice would you give to young people
[03:58:25.880 --> 03:58:29.960]   to live their life fully?
[03:58:29.960 --> 03:58:32.920]   I mean, Michael and I have talked about this,
[03:58:32.920 --> 03:58:35.360]   but it bears repeating.
[03:58:35.360 --> 03:58:37.320]   So if you look at John Galt,
[03:58:37.320 --> 03:58:41.280]   if you look at the highest ideals of a life we could live,
[03:58:41.280 --> 03:58:44.120]   what advice would you give to a 20-year-old today, 18-year-old?
[03:58:44.120 --> 03:58:46.800]   - Can I say, I don't think, and I think Rand would agree.
[03:58:46.800 --> 03:58:49.200]   When Rand was writing John Galt, she says,
[03:58:49.200 --> 03:58:51.680]   when you have this character's human perfection,
[03:58:51.680 --> 03:58:53.320]   you don't want to get too close.
[03:58:53.320 --> 03:58:55.160]   So he's a little bit of a vague character
[03:58:55.160 --> 03:58:57.000]   because she was aware that when you're dealing
[03:58:57.000 --> 03:58:59.560]   with day-to-day, the shine comes off.
[03:58:59.560 --> 03:59:03.440]   I think Rourke is a lot better character for a young person.
[03:59:03.440 --> 03:59:04.280]   - Or Reardon.
[03:59:04.280 --> 03:59:06.800]   - Yeah, but Rourke is, the entirety of the Fountainhead
[03:59:06.800 --> 03:59:08.640]   is Rourke, so and Reardon is one of several.
[03:59:08.640 --> 03:59:09.480]   - We barely know John Galt.
[03:59:09.480 --> 03:59:12.160]   - Yeah, but Rourke is someone where you could be like,
[03:59:12.160 --> 03:59:15.840]   okay, and what Rourke also gives young people is--
[03:59:15.840 --> 03:59:16.680]   - That's in "The Fountainhead."
[03:59:16.680 --> 03:59:19.920]   - "The Fountainhead" is the strength to persevere
[03:59:19.920 --> 03:59:23.360]   because when you're young, you're going to have down times.
[03:59:23.360 --> 03:59:25.600]   There's going to be times when you're lonely.
[03:59:25.600 --> 03:59:28.080]   There's going to be times when you don't have a girlfriend.
[03:59:28.080 --> 03:59:30.300]   There's going to be times when you're out of work
[03:59:30.300 --> 03:59:31.840]   and you're thinking, holy crap,
[03:59:31.840 --> 03:59:33.560]   I'm falling between the cracks.
[03:59:33.560 --> 03:59:35.920]   I'm going to accomplish, I'm going to be a failure.
[03:59:35.920 --> 03:59:38.760]   And he gives them the courage.
[03:59:38.760 --> 03:59:40.440]   There's even a scene in "The Fountainhead,"
[03:59:40.440 --> 03:59:42.160]   which is this amazing scene.
[03:59:42.160 --> 03:59:44.280]   I love that it's not talked about enough
[03:59:44.280 --> 03:59:46.400]   where basically Rourke is looking at one of his buildings
[03:59:46.400 --> 03:59:48.760]   and this little kid on a bicycle comes up to him
[03:59:48.760 --> 03:59:51.200]   and, Yaron, please correct me.
[03:59:51.200 --> 03:59:52.720]   And he's like, who built this?
[03:59:52.720 --> 03:59:54.520]   And Rourke said, I did.
[03:59:54.520 --> 03:59:57.240]   And the line is, Rourke didn't realize it,
[03:59:57.240 --> 03:59:59.960]   but he just gave that kid the courage to face a lifetime.
[03:59:59.960 --> 04:00:03.220]   And I think that is such a beautiful thing
[04:00:03.220 --> 04:00:06.120]   where you can find inspiration in this character.
[04:00:06.120 --> 04:00:08.240]   Don't become needlessly difficult.
[04:00:08.240 --> 04:00:09.960]   Don't start parroting his lines.
[04:00:09.960 --> 04:00:12.600]   You're not Howard Rourke and he's not a real person,
[04:00:12.600 --> 04:00:16.480]   but there's aspects of him that you can apply to your life.
[04:00:16.480 --> 04:00:18.920]   And here's something else, I'll give one example,
[04:00:18.920 --> 04:00:20.000]   'cause this happened to me.
[04:00:20.000 --> 04:00:21.600]   When I was working at Goldman Sachs,
[04:00:21.600 --> 04:00:22.880]   I was doing tech support,
[04:00:22.880 --> 04:00:25.320]   and my great-grandmother had passed away that year.
[04:00:25.320 --> 04:00:27.480]   And I promised my grandmother I would have,
[04:00:27.480 --> 04:00:28.880]   I've told this story several times,
[04:00:28.880 --> 04:00:31.080]   I would have Thanksgiving dinner with her.
[04:00:31.080 --> 04:00:33.380]   I was working second shift four to midnight,
[04:00:33.380 --> 04:00:35.660]   and we were a 24/7 help desk.
[04:00:35.660 --> 04:00:37.780]   And I got the schedule for the next week,
[04:00:37.780 --> 04:00:39.580]   and I told my grandma I'm going to have lunch
[04:00:39.580 --> 04:00:40.760]   with her on Thanksgiving.
[04:00:40.760 --> 04:00:43.000]   And they had put me down from four to midnight
[04:00:43.000 --> 04:00:45.040]   the day before Wednesday, which is my normal shift.
[04:00:45.040 --> 04:00:47.080]   But then the day shift, the next day,
[04:00:47.080 --> 04:00:49.480]   and I go to my boss, I go, first on second shift,
[04:00:49.480 --> 04:00:51.780]   I'm like, "This Thanksgiving, I promised my grandma."
[04:00:51.780 --> 04:00:53.120]   And they're like, "Well, if you could find someone
[04:00:53.120 --> 04:00:54.480]   "to fill this, we'll do it."
[04:00:54.480 --> 04:00:56.380]   And I asked everyone, they were like, "No."
[04:00:56.380 --> 04:00:58.480]   And I said, "I'm not coming in."
[04:00:58.480 --> 04:01:01.240]   And I 100%, not even a question,
[04:01:01.240 --> 04:01:03.400]   if I asked my grandmother, "Can we have dinner instead?"
[04:01:03.400 --> 04:01:04.600]   She would have said yes.
[04:01:04.600 --> 04:01:06.160]   But this was one of those moments,
[04:01:06.160 --> 04:01:07.680]   maybe this is from my huge ego,
[04:01:07.680 --> 04:01:10.120]   where I felt like I was in a movie and I'm making a choice.
[04:01:10.120 --> 04:01:12.640]   Am I going to ask grandma,
[04:01:12.640 --> 04:01:15.040]   or am I going to just bend the knee?
[04:01:15.040 --> 04:01:17.740]   And I go, I couldn't find anyone,
[04:01:17.740 --> 04:01:19.120]   and I go, "I'm not coming in."
[04:01:19.120 --> 04:01:21.440]   And they go, "If you're not coming in, you're fired."
[04:01:21.440 --> 04:01:23.040]   And I go, "Fire me."
[04:01:23.040 --> 04:01:26.920]   And they did fire me, and I have no regrets.
[04:01:26.920 --> 04:01:31.040]   And 'cause if I'd compromised, I'd have money in my pocket.
[04:01:31.040 --> 04:01:33.880]   But since I didn't compromise, I could look at that story.
[04:01:33.880 --> 04:01:36.840]   Ran talks about how man is a being of self-made soul.
[04:01:36.840 --> 04:01:38.400]   I could look at that story,
[04:01:38.400 --> 04:01:42.160]   and next time I have a time where it's a tough decision,
[04:01:42.160 --> 04:01:43.880]   where there's really pressure, I could be like,
[04:01:43.880 --> 04:01:44.840]   "You know what?
[04:01:44.840 --> 04:01:47.480]   "This is the kind of person you are, stick to it."
[04:01:47.480 --> 04:01:49.440]   I'll give one more example, sorry, you're on.
[04:01:49.440 --> 04:01:52.880]   I've given talks on networking, and I tell people,
[04:01:52.880 --> 04:01:54.880]   I like to use humor because humor is a great way
[04:01:54.880 --> 04:01:57.280]   to shortcut the brain and get the truth to them directly.
[04:01:57.280 --> 04:02:01.880]   I say, "If you know someone is in town,
[04:02:01.880 --> 04:02:04.000]   "it's their birthday, and they're not doing anything,
[04:02:04.000 --> 04:02:04.820]   "take them out."
[04:02:04.820 --> 04:02:07.280]   And I say, I do this for Rand reasons, I do it selfishly.
[04:02:07.280 --> 04:02:09.600]   And the audience laughs, and I go, "You're laughing,"
[04:02:09.600 --> 04:02:12.360]   but I go, "The guy who takes people out
[04:02:12.360 --> 04:02:14.720]   "for their birthday is awesome."
[04:02:14.720 --> 04:02:16.800]   That could be you, there's nothing stopping you.
[04:02:16.800 --> 04:02:18.360]   You're just not thinking in these terms.
[04:02:18.360 --> 04:02:20.200]   What's it gonna cost you, $30?
[04:02:20.200 --> 04:02:22.800]   But for the rest of their life or a few years,
[04:02:22.800 --> 04:02:24.300]   that person will remember you and be like,
[04:02:24.300 --> 04:02:25.140]   "You know what?
[04:02:25.140 --> 04:02:26.920]   "This person did right by me."
[04:02:26.920 --> 04:02:29.400]   And I'll give you a concrete example
[04:02:29.400 --> 04:02:31.400]   which changed my life profoundly.
[04:02:31.400 --> 04:02:34.240]   Ted Hope, who was the producer of the film,
[04:02:34.240 --> 04:02:37.200]   "American Splendor," which starred my mentor, Harvey Pekar,
[04:02:37.200 --> 04:02:39.660]   sent an email to his firm that said,
[04:02:39.660 --> 04:02:42.040]   "Harvey's in town with nothing to do.
[04:02:42.040 --> 04:02:44.400]   "If you wanna hang out with him, here's your chance."
[04:02:44.400 --> 04:02:47.760]   They worked at a film company, and I was the only one,
[04:02:47.760 --> 04:02:49.720]   I got the email, I wasn't working there,
[04:02:49.720 --> 04:02:52.120]   from a friend who took him up on it.
[04:02:52.120 --> 04:02:54.200]   And as a consequence, Harvey wrote a graphic novel
[04:02:54.200 --> 04:02:56.440]   about me, "Ego and Hubris," which is $250 on eBay now,
[04:02:56.440 --> 04:02:58.380]   and it moves at that, not too shabby.
[04:02:58.380 --> 04:03:01.600]   The point being, you know what?
[04:03:01.600 --> 04:03:03.320]   Someone had a movie made about him,
[04:03:03.320 --> 04:03:04.800]   someone is an interesting figure,
[04:03:04.800 --> 04:03:07.880]   take the lunch and stay overtime for an hour.
[04:03:07.880 --> 04:03:11.040]   But so many people don't think in those terms,
[04:03:11.040 --> 04:03:13.320]   and there's so many opportunities for them.
[04:03:13.320 --> 04:03:14.440]   So that's the advice I give.
[04:03:14.440 --> 04:03:17.460]   And I think it's also good to give advice via anecdote.
[04:03:17.460 --> 04:03:19.540]   So not only is the person getting the advice,
[04:03:19.540 --> 04:03:21.860]   they are learning why you got to that point.
[04:03:21.860 --> 04:03:24.840]   And maybe I'm wrong, but at least they've thought about it.
[04:03:24.840 --> 04:03:26.160]   - Yeah, I mean, I agree with all of that.
[04:03:26.160 --> 04:03:28.960]   And I like the line, Ayn Rand's line
[04:03:28.960 --> 04:03:30.600]   about man is a self-made soul,
[04:03:30.600 --> 04:03:33.440]   is a creature of a self-made soul, is huge.
[04:03:33.440 --> 04:03:36.240]   And it's something most people don't realize.
[04:03:36.240 --> 04:03:39.080]   And it's something that modern intellectuals undermine.
[04:03:39.080 --> 04:03:41.160]   I mean, even somebody like Sam Harris,
[04:03:41.160 --> 04:03:44.000]   when you keep telling people they don't have free will,
[04:03:44.000 --> 04:03:45.960]   then you don't have a self-made soul,
[04:03:45.960 --> 04:03:47.720]   'cause what is self-made?
[04:03:47.720 --> 04:03:49.800]   There is no self, according to Sam, right?
[04:03:49.800 --> 04:03:52.700]   He meditates and he sees that he doesn't have a self.
[04:03:52.700 --> 04:03:56.160]   So you're undermining the ability of people
[04:03:56.160 --> 04:03:58.460]   to take control of their own lives
[04:03:58.460 --> 04:04:01.600]   and make the kind of choices that are necessary
[04:04:01.600 --> 04:04:03.160]   to create the kind of moral character
[04:04:03.160 --> 04:04:05.560]   that is necessary for them to be successful.
[04:04:05.560 --> 04:04:07.680]   So I'd encourage people to go read
[04:04:07.680 --> 04:04:09.040]   "Found Head and Outward Shrugged"
[04:04:09.040 --> 04:04:12.200]   because put aside the politics,
[04:04:12.200 --> 04:04:14.920]   put aside even aspects of the philosophy,
[04:04:14.920 --> 04:04:17.200]   focus on these models.
[04:04:17.200 --> 04:04:21.240]   These are, you know, Howard Walker's a great model
[04:04:21.240 --> 04:04:22.520]   for all of us.
[04:04:22.520 --> 04:04:25.220]   It's a great story to have in your head, in your mind,
[04:04:25.220 --> 04:04:29.300]   when you encounter challenging choices that you might make.
[04:04:29.300 --> 04:04:32.900]   And then spend the time, and this is,
[04:04:32.900 --> 04:04:35.520]   I don't think I ever did this when I was young.
[04:04:35.520 --> 04:04:36.600]   I don't think people do this,
[04:04:36.600 --> 04:04:39.840]   but spend the time thinking about what your values really are.
[04:04:39.840 --> 04:04:41.080]   What do you love doing?
[04:04:41.080 --> 04:04:44.900]   What makes, what gets you going?
[04:04:44.900 --> 04:04:45.960]   What gets you excited?
[04:04:45.960 --> 04:04:50.000]   And how can I make a living at this?
[04:04:50.000 --> 04:04:53.460]   How can I do this and live through this?
[04:04:53.460 --> 04:04:57.200]   And then, you know, think about what kind of life you want,
[04:04:57.200 --> 04:04:58.040]   what kind of, I don't know,
[04:04:58.040 --> 04:04:59.480]   what kind of people you wanna hang out with.
[04:04:59.480 --> 04:05:02.300]   Don't let life just happen to you.
[04:05:03.120 --> 04:05:04.040]   Think it through.
[04:05:04.040 --> 04:05:05.640]   What kind of people, for example,
[04:05:05.640 --> 04:05:07.360]   if you want ambitious, excited,
[04:05:07.360 --> 04:05:08.600]   maybe you should move to Silicon Valley,
[04:05:08.600 --> 04:05:09.880]   to Austin, Texas, right?
[04:05:09.880 --> 04:05:13.680]   If you wanna be around artsy people,
[04:05:13.680 --> 04:05:14.520]   maybe you should go to Hollywood,
[04:05:14.520 --> 04:05:15.440]   maybe you should go to New York.
[04:05:15.440 --> 04:05:16.640]   You know, I don't know,
[04:05:16.640 --> 04:05:20.060]   but figure out what kind of life you wanna live,
[04:05:20.060 --> 04:05:21.480]   what kind of people you wanna hang out with,
[04:05:21.480 --> 04:05:23.680]   what kind of woman you wanna spend your life with,
[04:05:23.680 --> 04:05:26.520]   or what kind of romantic relationship you wanna have.
[04:05:26.520 --> 04:05:29.220]   Figure that out and go and do it.
[04:05:29.220 --> 04:05:30.180]   Don't sit around.
[04:05:30.180 --> 04:05:31.520]   Life is not--
[04:05:31.520 --> 04:05:32.480]   - Or try and fail.
[04:05:32.480 --> 04:05:33.320]   It's okay.
[04:05:33.320 --> 04:05:34.140]   You're gonna fail.
[04:05:34.140 --> 04:05:35.760]   - Oh, failure, failure is absolute.
[04:05:35.760 --> 04:05:36.880]   And learn from that failure.
[04:05:36.880 --> 04:05:37.720]   And that's the other thing.
[04:05:37.720 --> 04:05:38.760]   Think about what you're doing,
[04:05:38.760 --> 04:05:40.640]   why you're succeeding, why you're failing,
[04:05:40.640 --> 04:05:42.400]   and keep improving, keep working on it,
[04:05:42.400 --> 04:05:43.960]   because it's not just gonna happen like this.
[04:05:43.960 --> 04:05:47.360]   Nobody is Francisco to take a character out of "Atlas"
[04:05:47.360 --> 04:05:49.960]   or to succeed at everything first try, right?
[04:05:49.960 --> 04:05:51.720]   We all need to fail a few times.
[04:05:51.720 --> 04:05:54.980]   We all need to, but what if you got to lose?
[04:05:54.980 --> 04:05:58.800]   Every second is never gonna be back.
[04:05:58.800 --> 04:05:59.980]   I mean, these are all cliches,
[04:05:59.980 --> 04:06:02.280]   but they're all true cliches, right?
[04:06:02.280 --> 04:06:07.280]   So think, figure out what your values are,
[04:06:07.280 --> 04:06:10.640]   and try to apply your reason,
[04:06:10.640 --> 04:06:13.200]   your rational thought on getting those values.
[04:06:13.200 --> 04:06:16.360]   And try to, we talked about early on in the show,
[04:06:16.360 --> 04:06:19.360]   in the interview, we talked about integrating your emotions
[04:06:19.360 --> 04:06:21.280]   with your cognition.
[04:06:21.280 --> 04:06:22.320]   I think that's crucial,
[04:06:22.320 --> 04:06:24.200]   'cause you don't want to be fighting your emotions
[04:06:24.200 --> 04:06:25.600]   as you move towards these things.
[04:06:25.600 --> 04:06:27.520]   You don't want your emotions to be barriers
[04:06:27.520 --> 04:06:28.380]   to your own success.
[04:06:28.380 --> 04:06:30.800]   You want them to be cheerleaders, right?
[04:06:30.800 --> 04:06:33.240]   To chew on when good things happen
[04:06:33.240 --> 04:06:35.840]   and to be negative emotions
[04:06:35.840 --> 04:06:38.160]   when it's justified that they're negative.
[04:06:38.160 --> 04:06:40.920]   So work on integrating your soul.
[04:06:40.920 --> 04:06:44.120]   So creating your soul, that's the real challenge.
[04:06:44.120 --> 04:06:46.280]   - And I'll give one piece of meta advice.
[04:06:46.280 --> 04:06:48.680]   When you're young, you're gonna be clueless,
[04:06:48.680 --> 04:06:50.480]   'cause you're gonna be ignorant, you know the data.
[04:06:50.480 --> 04:06:53.320]   Don't ask your dopey friends for advice,
[04:06:53.320 --> 04:06:54.160]   'cause they wanna be helpful.
[04:06:54.160 --> 04:06:55.760]   - Or your parents.
[04:06:55.760 --> 04:06:57.120]   - But the friends wanna be helpful.
[04:06:57.120 --> 04:06:58.200]   They're as dopey as you.
[04:06:58.200 --> 04:06:59.540]   They're uninformed as you.
[04:06:59.540 --> 04:07:01.380]   So they're just gonna give you platitudes
[04:07:01.380 --> 04:07:02.420]   and you're gonna be worse off,
[04:07:02.420 --> 04:07:04.300]   'cause now you're gonna be confused.
[04:07:04.300 --> 04:07:05.980]   Especially with social media.
[04:07:05.980 --> 04:07:08.300]   Reach out to people who are older than you,
[04:07:08.300 --> 04:07:09.220]   who are accomplished.
[04:07:09.220 --> 04:07:12.460]   You'd be surprised how often that you gotta send them 20 bucks,
[04:07:12.460 --> 04:07:15.100]   buy them dinner, buy their book, whatever it takes.
[04:07:15.100 --> 04:07:19.900]   You are getting free world-class advice for very cheap.
[04:07:19.900 --> 04:07:23.020]   And that is really a mechanism for success.
[04:07:23.020 --> 04:07:25.740]   - And here's something very unpopular and not sexy.
[04:07:25.740 --> 04:07:28.240]   This is why people probably unfollow me.
[04:07:28.240 --> 04:07:29.080]   - That's not why.
[04:07:29.080 --> 04:07:29.900]   - Read.
[04:07:29.900 --> 04:07:31.920]   Well, you'll tell me why after this.
[04:07:31.920 --> 04:07:33.160]   Read, read, read.
[04:07:33.160 --> 04:07:36.600]   Because you're not always gonna have access to those experts.
[04:07:36.600 --> 04:07:39.320]   And I'm not just talking about self-help books.
[04:07:39.320 --> 04:07:40.920]   I'm not even talking about self-help books.
[04:07:40.920 --> 04:07:42.560]   Read the worlds with literature.
[04:07:42.560 --> 04:07:44.680]   I mean, literature presents you
[04:07:44.680 --> 04:07:46.660]   with all the different characters.
[04:07:46.660 --> 04:07:49.920]   Read Dostoevsky, right?
[04:07:49.920 --> 04:07:52.480]   Read Hugo, right?
[04:07:52.480 --> 04:07:54.800]   Read all these authors that have taken time
[04:07:54.800 --> 04:07:57.960]   to really create characters and put them in situations
[04:07:57.960 --> 04:08:00.480]   that maybe you will never face those exact situations,
[04:08:00.480 --> 04:08:02.280]   but you'll face similar situations.
[04:08:02.280 --> 04:08:04.440]   And they play it out for you.
[04:08:04.440 --> 04:08:06.680]   You'll see what the consequences are.
[04:08:06.680 --> 04:08:10.320]   Great literature is a real tool for building your soul.
[04:08:10.320 --> 04:08:12.800]   Great art generally, but literature in particular,
[04:08:12.800 --> 04:08:14.240]   because it's more conceptual.
[04:08:14.240 --> 04:08:17.480]   - Maybe you could speak to love
[04:08:17.480 --> 04:08:18.960]   and relationship in your own life,
[04:08:18.960 --> 04:08:21.880]   but in general, if we look at Alice Shrugged,
[04:08:21.880 --> 04:08:23.360]   if we look at Fountainhead,
[04:08:24.320 --> 04:08:27.680]   and maybe this is going to become a therapy session for Lex,
[04:08:27.680 --> 04:08:31.440]   but also just looking at your own life in a form of advice,
[04:08:31.440 --> 04:08:35.880]   how can you be a Rorik Riordan type character
[04:08:35.880 --> 04:08:39.400]   and live your life to the fullest
[04:08:39.400 --> 04:08:42.440]   in creating the most amazing things
[04:08:42.440 --> 04:08:44.240]   that you're able to create,
[04:08:44.240 --> 04:08:49.240]   and yet have others in your life that you give yourself to
[04:08:49.240 --> 04:08:53.120]   in terms of loving them fully and having a family,
[04:08:53.120 --> 04:08:55.880]   having kids, but even just the love of your life
[04:08:55.880 --> 04:09:00.120]   kind of thing, how do you balance those things together?
[04:09:00.120 --> 04:09:02.320]   Is there anything to say?
[04:09:02.320 --> 04:09:04.000]   - I'll say one thing, 'cause then I'll defer to your own,
[04:09:04.000 --> 04:09:05.680]   'cause he's the one who's married here.
[04:09:05.680 --> 04:09:07.120]   I don't think it's a balance.
[04:09:07.120 --> 04:09:09.480]   I think they compliment each other and feed off each other.
[04:09:09.480 --> 04:09:12.160]   So it's like, how do you balance having shoes and pants?
[04:09:12.160 --> 04:09:13.960]   It's like, no, you want both.
[04:09:13.960 --> 04:09:14.800]   - You want it all.
[04:09:14.800 --> 04:09:18.320]   - And having a great partner who thinks you're a badass,
[04:09:18.320 --> 04:09:20.360]   and then sometimes they're on the stage and you're like,
[04:09:20.360 --> 04:09:21.800]   oh my, I'm married to a badass.
[04:09:21.800 --> 04:09:23.600]   That's the goal.
[04:09:23.600 --> 04:09:24.440]   Am I wrong?
[04:09:24.440 --> 04:09:25.260]   - No, absolutely.
[04:09:25.260 --> 04:09:26.100]   It feeds off of each other.
[04:09:26.100 --> 04:09:27.000]   It's synergetic.
[04:09:27.000 --> 04:09:28.280]   It's completely synergetic.
[04:09:28.280 --> 04:09:30.760]   The problem that people have, I think,
[04:09:30.760 --> 04:09:32.680]   where they get into challenges
[04:09:32.680 --> 04:09:34.800]   is when they view them as opposites, right?
[04:09:34.800 --> 04:09:36.040]   Work or family.
[04:09:36.040 --> 04:09:38.760]   Well, if you don't work the family,
[04:09:38.760 --> 04:09:41.400]   you can't finance the family, but more than that,
[04:09:41.400 --> 04:09:45.640]   why is your wife gonna love you, right?
[04:09:45.640 --> 04:09:47.400]   What are the virtues that you're bringing?
[04:09:47.400 --> 04:09:49.440]   If you don't maximize your own potential,
[04:09:49.440 --> 04:09:51.280]   if you don't live the best life that you can live,
[04:09:51.280 --> 04:09:52.800]   what is it to love?
[04:09:52.800 --> 04:09:56.080]   And if she doesn't do the same thing, why do you love her?
[04:09:56.080 --> 04:09:59.960]   So you don't get this conflict between work
[04:09:59.960 --> 04:10:02.120]   and how do I have a balanced life?
[04:10:02.120 --> 04:10:03.520]   Of course you have a balanced life.
[04:10:03.520 --> 04:10:05.560]   You balance it based on your values,
[04:10:05.560 --> 04:10:07.240]   and it's never gonna be the same.
[04:10:07.240 --> 04:10:10.240]   The balance is, the time you spend at work
[04:10:10.240 --> 04:10:12.500]   and with family when you're young
[04:10:12.500 --> 04:10:15.040]   or when you have little kids or when they're grown up
[04:10:15.040 --> 04:10:15.960]   is all gonna be different.
[04:10:15.960 --> 04:10:18.400]   It's gonna depend on your priorities at the point,
[04:10:18.400 --> 04:10:20.040]   but it's all gonna feed off of each other.
[04:10:20.040 --> 04:10:23.200]   - So maybe another word outside of balance is sacrifice.
[04:10:23.200 --> 04:10:25.520]   Do you think relationship involves sacrifice or not?
[04:10:25.520 --> 04:10:26.520]   - Does he know what he's doing?
[04:10:26.520 --> 04:10:28.480]   - I know, I think he's trolling you.
[04:10:28.480 --> 04:10:29.320]   He's a troll.
[04:10:29.320 --> 04:10:30.440]   He's a big troll.
[04:10:30.440 --> 04:10:31.960]   Lex is the biggest troll on Twitter.
[04:10:31.960 --> 04:10:36.280]   - Ever, ever, ever sacrifice.
[04:10:36.280 --> 04:10:37.120]   - Never sacrifice.
[04:10:37.120 --> 04:10:38.800]   - But see, he means sacrifice in the context.
[04:10:38.800 --> 04:10:40.800]   - I know, I know, so I'm gonna define it.
[04:10:40.800 --> 04:10:42.640]   So sacrifice in my world.
[04:10:42.640 --> 04:10:44.840]   - Can I say one thing before we get sidebar?
[04:10:44.840 --> 04:10:48.440]   Ran had a good example of what he's talking about balance.
[04:10:48.440 --> 04:10:50.120]   So she was married to this guy, Frank O'Connor.
[04:10:50.120 --> 04:10:51.000]   He was not as cerebral.
[04:10:51.000 --> 04:10:51.880]   He was not intellectual.
[04:10:51.880 --> 04:10:53.160]   That's fine, she was in love with him.
[04:10:53.160 --> 04:10:54.840]   And I met someone who had been friends with Ran.
[04:10:54.840 --> 04:10:56.560]   And a lot of times she'd have these conversations
[04:10:56.560 --> 04:10:58.160]   with her acolytes till like four in the morning
[04:10:58.160 --> 04:10:59.800]   about the most cerebral topics.
[04:10:59.800 --> 04:11:01.520]   And I said, and he would always bring them food.
[04:11:01.520 --> 04:11:03.640]   He'd stay up and kind of sit there in a corner.
[04:11:03.640 --> 04:11:06.200]   And I go, when this was happening,
[04:11:06.200 --> 04:11:07.240]   was he sitting there like,
[04:11:07.240 --> 04:11:09.680]   oh God, here goes crazy old I'm and I just gotta be bored.
[04:11:09.680 --> 04:11:12.000]   And they go, absolutely not.
[04:11:12.000 --> 04:11:14.080]   He was so proud of her.
[04:11:14.080 --> 04:11:15.600]   He was so excited.
[04:11:15.600 --> 04:11:17.320]   In fact, when she got a lot of money
[04:11:17.320 --> 04:11:19.200]   from I think selling Red Pond,
[04:11:19.200 --> 04:11:20.800]   which was her screenplay, which never produced,
[04:11:20.800 --> 04:11:23.760]   he told her you can buy any kind of fur coat
[04:11:23.760 --> 04:11:24.800]   as long as it's mink.
[04:11:24.800 --> 04:11:28.000]   He's like, you earned this, celebrate it.
[04:11:28.000 --> 04:11:28.840]   So that was a good example.
[04:11:28.840 --> 04:11:31.240]   - And that's a good relationship, absolutely.
[04:11:31.240 --> 04:11:35.080]   No, sacrifice is the giving of a value
[04:11:35.080 --> 04:11:38.320]   and expecting either nothing or something less in return.
[04:11:38.320 --> 04:11:41.440]   You don't do that in a love relationship.
[04:11:41.440 --> 04:11:45.240]   Your love relationship is a sense, a trade.
[04:11:45.240 --> 04:11:46.360]   You're constantly trading.
[04:11:46.360 --> 04:11:48.120]   You're not trading materially,
[04:11:48.120 --> 04:11:49.840]   but you're trading spiritually.
[04:11:49.840 --> 04:11:52.400]   Imagine if I only gave my wife,
[04:11:52.400 --> 04:11:54.400]   if I gave spiritually and materially,
[04:11:54.400 --> 04:11:55.560]   only in one direction.
[04:11:55.560 --> 04:11:57.320]   I'd get sick of it.
[04:11:57.320 --> 04:11:58.280]   She'd get sick of it.
[04:11:58.280 --> 04:11:59.600]   It would never last.
[04:11:59.600 --> 04:12:01.960]   It has to be in give and take constantly
[04:12:01.960 --> 04:12:04.880]   in different ways, different values.
[04:12:04.880 --> 04:12:07.120]   It's not a monetary exchange,
[04:12:07.120 --> 04:12:08.840]   but it's constantly you're giving
[04:12:08.840 --> 04:12:10.960]   and you're receiving and you're giving.
[04:12:10.960 --> 04:12:14.680]   And that's gotta be in balance.
[04:12:14.680 --> 04:12:16.080]   And I know a lot of relationship
[04:12:16.080 --> 04:12:18.360]   where that gets out of bounds.
[04:12:18.360 --> 04:12:21.040]   And at one party feels like they're giving all the time,
[04:12:21.040 --> 04:12:22.240]   they're sacrificing.
[04:12:22.240 --> 04:12:24.600]   They're giving more than they're receiving in a sense.
[04:12:24.600 --> 04:12:25.440]   And it's over.
[04:12:25.440 --> 04:12:29.280]   Now people use the word sacrifice,
[04:12:29.280 --> 04:12:32.440]   like Jordan Peterson, sometimes he uses it both ways.
[04:12:32.440 --> 04:12:33.280]   That's the problem.
[04:12:33.280 --> 04:12:34.120]   People use it. - You know Jordan?
[04:12:34.120 --> 04:12:35.360]   - I don't know him personally.
[04:12:35.360 --> 04:12:36.280]   Jordan Peterson, I said.
[04:12:36.280 --> 04:12:37.520]   I didn't call him Jordan, you see.
[04:12:37.520 --> 04:12:39.040]   - Just wanted to be clear.
[04:12:39.040 --> 04:12:40.840]   - He uses in his talks as,
[04:12:40.840 --> 04:12:43.680]   sometimes he uses it as just as I described it.
[04:12:43.680 --> 04:12:44.680]   And he's supportive of that,
[04:12:44.680 --> 04:12:46.360]   like the sacrifice Jesus made, right?
[04:12:46.360 --> 04:12:49.320]   And sometimes he uses as an investment.
[04:12:49.320 --> 04:12:50.560]   But it's not.
[04:12:50.560 --> 04:12:53.280]   If you're giving some, giving money now,
[04:12:53.280 --> 04:12:55.240]   expecting a bigger return in the future,
[04:12:55.240 --> 04:12:57.200]   that's not a sacrifice, that's an investment.
[04:12:57.200 --> 04:12:58.920]   That's why we have two concepts for that.
[04:12:58.920 --> 04:13:02.200]   And the same is true, if my wife is ill
[04:13:02.200 --> 04:13:06.320]   and I've got a whole relationship build
[04:13:06.320 --> 04:13:07.520]   around what I'm giving.
[04:13:07.520 --> 04:13:09.120]   It's not that I'm not getting anything back.
[04:13:09.120 --> 04:13:12.800]   What I'm getting back is that she is recovering, right?
[04:13:12.800 --> 04:13:15.480]   Is that she is, she's still alive
[04:13:15.480 --> 04:13:17.080]   or whatever it is that I'm keeping.
[04:13:17.080 --> 04:13:19.240]   That's the value that I'm getting in return.
[04:13:19.240 --> 04:13:21.840]   If I'm not getting that, why am I doing it?
[04:13:21.840 --> 04:13:24.840]   'Cause I signed a contract a long time ago.
[04:13:24.840 --> 04:13:28.200]   So it's not a sacrifice.
[04:13:28.200 --> 04:13:29.040]   Children are not a sacrifice.
[04:13:29.040 --> 04:13:30.280]   If I don't go to the movies
[04:13:30.280 --> 04:13:32.760]   'cause I stay with my home with my kids,
[04:13:32.760 --> 04:13:33.920]   it's because I love my kids more
[04:13:33.920 --> 04:13:35.840]   than I love going to the movies, right?
[04:13:35.840 --> 04:13:37.680]   And if I love going to the movies
[04:13:37.680 --> 04:13:38.920]   more than I love staying with the kids,
[04:13:38.920 --> 04:13:41.680]   then get a babysitter or don't have kids,
[04:13:41.680 --> 04:13:43.640]   which is the better approach.
[04:13:43.640 --> 04:13:45.600]   - Here's another tricky question.
[04:13:45.600 --> 04:13:47.680]   What book did Ayn Rand say is the most evil book
[04:13:47.680 --> 04:13:48.920]   in all of serious literature?
[04:13:48.920 --> 04:13:50.320]   - Tolstoy? - It was Anacronina.
[04:13:50.320 --> 04:13:51.160]   - Yeah, Anacronina.
[04:13:51.160 --> 04:13:52.840]   - And the reason it was that book, which I haven't read,
[04:13:52.840 --> 04:13:54.480]   please correct me if I get the plot wrong,
[04:13:54.480 --> 04:13:56.560]   what Rand was saying is the plot is a guy
[04:13:56.560 --> 04:13:57.840]   who's a big shot, I think.
[04:13:57.840 --> 04:14:00.240]   He marries a stupid girl who has nothing of value
[04:14:00.240 --> 04:14:03.000]   to offer him at all and she ends up killing herself.
[04:14:03.000 --> 04:14:04.040]   Whereas Rand's version,
[04:14:04.040 --> 04:14:06.640]   and we can take this out of the romantic context.
[04:14:06.640 --> 04:14:10.480]   I am delighted when I could be of use to my friends.
[04:14:10.480 --> 04:14:12.480]   It makes me feel wonderful
[04:14:12.480 --> 04:14:14.160]   and not in a kind of parasitic way.
[04:14:14.160 --> 04:14:16.640]   It's just like that I'm at a certain point
[04:14:16.640 --> 04:14:18.440]   where they call me up, they're having a problem
[04:14:18.440 --> 04:14:19.280]   and I've helped them with that problem.
[04:14:19.280 --> 04:14:23.400]   - So Anacronina, he gives up the love of his life.
[04:14:23.400 --> 04:14:24.680]   - Oh, is that what it is? - The intelligent girl,
[04:14:24.680 --> 04:14:26.320]   the amazing girl.
[04:14:26.320 --> 04:14:28.640]   He has an affair with her outside of marriage,
[04:14:28.640 --> 04:14:32.160]   taints her, is married to the stupid,
[04:14:32.160 --> 04:14:34.680]   but she gives him the prestige and everything.
[04:14:34.680 --> 04:14:36.200]   - Oh, that's clearly very anti-Rand.
[04:14:36.200 --> 04:14:37.040]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:14:37.040 --> 04:14:42.040]   - And the smart, the one he loves,
[04:14:42.040 --> 04:14:43.320]   she commits suicide in there.
[04:14:43.320 --> 04:14:44.160]   - Oh, okay, I got it wrong.
[04:14:44.160 --> 04:14:49.160]   - So it's about him choosing mediocrity
[04:14:49.160 --> 04:14:53.440]   and nothingness over love.
[04:14:53.440 --> 04:14:56.720]   So pursuing your values is so crucial.
[04:14:56.720 --> 04:14:59.240]   So don't sacrifice, that doesn't mean
[04:14:59.240 --> 04:15:00.640]   that if you wanna eat Chinese
[04:15:00.640 --> 04:15:01.840]   and she wanna eat Italian,
[04:15:01.840 --> 04:15:04.000]   you don't once in a while eat Italian on that day, right?
[04:15:04.000 --> 04:15:04.840]   - Just noodles.
[04:15:05.680 --> 04:15:06.520]   Just get noodles.
[04:15:06.520 --> 04:15:07.600]   - That's silly, right?
[04:15:07.600 --> 04:15:09.720]   That's not a sacrifice, not in the sense
[04:15:09.720 --> 04:15:10.560]   in which we're talking about.
[04:15:10.560 --> 04:15:13.480]   That's, you know, it doesn't mean don't compromise.
[04:15:13.480 --> 04:15:16.520]   It doesn't mean don't compromise on the day-to-day stuff.
[04:15:16.520 --> 04:15:18.720]   It means don't compromise on moral values.
[04:15:18.720 --> 04:15:20.800]   You don't compromise on the big stuff
[04:15:20.800 --> 04:15:23.440]   and you never sacrifice.
[04:15:23.440 --> 04:15:26.800]   And that way you have a relationship that's built as equals
[04:15:26.800 --> 04:15:30.720]   and as you admire each other.
[04:15:30.720 --> 04:15:35.160]   And love at the end of the day is a response to value.
[04:15:35.160 --> 04:15:37.840]   If you stop undermining your own value,
[04:15:37.840 --> 04:15:41.920]   the person who loves you will stop loving you
[04:15:41.920 --> 04:15:43.200]   or love you less.
[04:15:43.200 --> 04:15:46.120]   If you love yourself less, you know, you have to,
[04:15:46.120 --> 04:15:48.480]   Jay, Ayn Rand also said, in order to say I love you,
[04:15:48.480 --> 04:15:51.280]   you have to be able to say the I, right?
[04:15:51.280 --> 04:15:54.760]   You have to be somebody, you have to know yourself,
[04:15:54.760 --> 04:15:57.480]   you have to have value.
[04:15:57.480 --> 04:16:02.240]   And so love is a profound emotional response to value.
[04:16:02.240 --> 04:16:05.200]   - So speaking of love and the three of us
[04:16:05.200 --> 04:16:07.440]   being on this deserted island for time together,
[04:16:07.440 --> 04:16:09.480]   somehow not murdering each other,
[04:16:09.480 --> 04:16:13.240]   let me ask you, Yaron, Michael,
[04:16:13.240 --> 04:16:18.120]   what is the most beautiful thing you find about the other?
[04:16:18.120 --> 04:16:19.720]   So let's go Yaron first.
[04:16:19.720 --> 04:16:21.840]   What do you think about Michael
[04:16:21.840 --> 04:16:23.280]   that you appreciate about him?
[04:16:23.280 --> 04:16:24.280]   - Let me just get these questions from him.
[04:16:24.280 --> 04:16:27.040]   - That you think, what do you love?
[04:16:27.040 --> 04:16:28.560]   - What do you love about Michael?
[04:16:28.560 --> 04:16:29.400]   - That makes sense.
[04:16:29.400 --> 04:16:30.520]   - Then he's gonna edit it.
[04:16:30.520 --> 04:16:31.520]   (laughing)
[04:16:31.520 --> 04:16:32.480]   - See, that makes sense to me.
[04:16:32.480 --> 04:16:33.640]   - I just programmed him.
[04:16:33.640 --> 04:16:36.920]   - Press play, it's all just a pre-recorded message.
[04:16:36.920 --> 04:16:38.800]   - So I've never met Michael before, so this is my--
[04:16:38.800 --> 04:16:40.480]   - That's not true, you have and--
[04:16:40.480 --> 04:16:42.120]   - So I don't remember ever meeting Michael before.
[04:16:42.120 --> 04:16:44.960]   - And you're the very beginning of the new right,
[04:16:44.960 --> 04:16:46.520]   is me meeting you.
[04:16:46.520 --> 04:16:47.400]   - I'm in the book?
[04:16:47.400 --> 04:16:48.240]   - Yes.
[04:16:48.240 --> 04:16:49.520]   - All right, well now I have to read his book
[04:16:49.520 --> 04:16:53.240]   'cause I mean, am I presented positively or negatively?
[04:16:53.240 --> 04:16:54.080]   - Very.
[04:16:54.080 --> 04:16:54.920]   - Oh, okay, good.
[04:16:54.920 --> 04:16:56.320]   (laughing)
[04:16:56.320 --> 04:16:57.640]   - Alex is not so sure.
[04:16:57.640 --> 04:16:58.480]   He's like--
[04:16:58.480 --> 04:16:59.320]   - No, I like that he goes,
[04:16:59.320 --> 04:17:01.440]   "Am I presented positively or negatively?"
[04:17:01.440 --> 04:17:02.280]   I just go, "Very."
[04:17:02.280 --> 04:17:03.120]   - Very.
[04:17:03.120 --> 04:17:04.200]   (laughing)
[04:17:04.200 --> 04:17:05.040]   - And he's like, "Oh, good."
[04:17:05.040 --> 04:17:06.040]   I'm like, "Is it?"
[04:17:06.040 --> 04:17:07.960]   (laughing)
[04:17:07.960 --> 04:17:10.960]   - So he's, Michael's sharp, he's quick.
[04:17:10.960 --> 04:17:16.160]   He's funny, although some of the humor is beyond me.
[04:17:16.160 --> 04:17:17.000]   I'm not sure--
[04:17:17.000 --> 04:17:18.640]   - That's a nice way of saying he's very intelligent.
[04:17:18.640 --> 04:17:20.840]   - Yeah, he's definitely very intelligent
[04:17:20.840 --> 04:17:25.000]   and, but also very engaging.
[04:17:25.000 --> 04:17:26.800]   I think that's very engaging.
[04:17:26.800 --> 04:17:27.640]   - And a sharp dresser.
[04:17:27.640 --> 04:17:28.600]   - That's fun.
[04:17:28.600 --> 04:17:29.440]   - And--
[04:17:29.440 --> 04:17:30.280]   - Oh, he's definitely, well, yeah,
[04:17:30.280 --> 04:17:32.720]   I'm gonna compliment him on stuff that's obvious
[04:17:32.720 --> 04:17:34.000]   and everybody can see by the video.
[04:17:34.000 --> 04:17:34.920]   - The sex appeal.
[04:17:34.920 --> 04:17:37.040]   Let me also just comment one thing you mentioned
[04:17:37.040 --> 04:17:42.040]   about you deriving joy from being of value to your friends.
[04:17:42.040 --> 04:17:43.120]   - Yeah.
[04:17:43.120 --> 04:17:45.320]   - You know, people talk to me about you sometimes
[04:17:45.320 --> 04:17:47.800]   'cause you'll do humor about various things
[04:17:47.800 --> 04:17:51.680]   and things like maybe you're some kind of crazy person
[04:17:51.680 --> 04:17:52.520]   or something like that.
[04:17:52.520 --> 04:17:53.520]   - Good, I wanted to--
[04:17:53.520 --> 04:17:55.440]   - Yeah, I know you enjoy this aspect of it,
[04:17:55.440 --> 04:17:58.920]   but I say that the reason I'm friends with Michael
[04:17:58.920 --> 04:18:01.200]   is there's like real love there.
[04:18:01.200 --> 04:18:04.400]   And like the kind of kindness you give to your friends,
[04:18:04.400 --> 04:18:07.620]   to people like that are close to you, to your family,
[04:18:07.620 --> 04:18:10.340]   is amazing, man.
[04:18:10.340 --> 04:18:13.080]   So that's one of my favorite things about you.
[04:18:13.080 --> 04:18:17.260]   Your intellect aside, your philosophies aside,
[04:18:17.260 --> 04:18:19.680]   your humor aside, I think there's a lot of love in you.
[04:18:19.680 --> 04:18:21.040]   That's what I really appreciate.
[04:18:21.040 --> 04:18:22.640]   But enough about you.
[04:18:22.640 --> 04:18:25.080]   I'm actually getting sick of saying nice things about you.
[04:18:25.080 --> 04:18:25.920]   - You're always good at saying it.
[04:18:25.920 --> 04:18:28.220]   - What, I take it all back.
[04:18:28.220 --> 04:18:31.180]   - Can I say one thing?
[04:18:31.180 --> 04:18:34.280]   You're joking, but this is something that's very key
[04:18:34.280 --> 04:18:36.560]   and this is something in a random context.
[04:18:36.560 --> 04:18:40.160]   It is very disturbing, and this is not by accident,
[04:18:40.160 --> 04:18:45.160]   how in our culture it is poo-pooed to show kindness,
[04:18:45.160 --> 04:18:48.700]   earnestness, appreciation, to tell someone,
[04:18:48.700 --> 04:18:49.960]   you see this on Twitter where someone's like,
[04:18:49.960 --> 04:18:51.040]   "You know what, I read your book.
[04:18:51.040 --> 04:18:53.680]   "It's made my life a lot better."
[04:18:53.680 --> 04:18:54.800]   Okay, simp.
[04:18:54.800 --> 04:18:57.680]   And there is a real, and this very much comes
[04:18:57.680 --> 04:19:01.820]   out of urban media circles, there's this real disdain
[04:19:01.820 --> 04:19:05.060]   for showing appreciation, for showing happiness,
[04:19:05.060 --> 04:19:07.680]   for showing kindness, and you don't know,
[04:19:07.680 --> 04:19:09.560]   now that I've called it out, you'll notice it,
[04:19:09.560 --> 04:19:11.320]   but when you see how common it is
[04:19:11.320 --> 04:19:13.220]   and how people can't take compliments,
[04:19:13.220 --> 04:19:17.400]   the effects of that are extreme and extremely negative.
[04:19:17.400 --> 04:19:19.240]   - I gotta say about Texas, one of the--
[04:19:19.240 --> 04:19:20.680]   - Texas in particular.
[04:19:20.680 --> 04:19:22.040]   - So Austin especially, I mean,
[04:19:22.040 --> 04:19:24.040]   I don't really fully know Texas, Texas,
[04:19:24.040 --> 04:19:26.720]   but Austin, the friendliness, there's a reason
[04:19:26.720 --> 04:19:30.040]   I've gotten fatter and been drinking a lot
[04:19:30.040 --> 04:19:32.840]   is all the friendliness from random people
[04:19:32.840 --> 04:19:35.320]   who are no longer random, they're just friends.
[04:19:35.320 --> 04:19:37.760]   I've made more friends in one week
[04:19:37.760 --> 04:19:41.400]   than I have in my entire stay in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
[04:19:41.400 --> 04:19:42.240]   - Yeah.
[04:19:42.240 --> 04:19:43.060]   (laughing)
[04:19:43.060 --> 04:19:44.160]   - Exactly, yeah, exactly.
[04:19:44.160 --> 04:19:45.000]   - One and a half.
[04:19:45.000 --> 04:19:46.840]   - You know what the number two means?
[04:19:46.840 --> 04:19:48.680]   - I've never counted up that high.
[04:19:49.720 --> 04:19:52.880]   - So this is what happens when people are free.
[04:19:52.880 --> 04:19:53.720]   - No.
[04:19:53.720 --> 04:19:55.400]   - When people are free and individualistic,
[04:19:55.400 --> 04:19:57.680]   it's exact opposite of what people believe.
[04:19:57.680 --> 04:20:00.960]   The more collectivist we are, the less free we are,
[04:20:00.960 --> 04:20:02.720]   the nastier we are to one another.
[04:20:02.720 --> 04:20:05.120]   Individualists who are pursuing their own happiness
[04:20:05.120 --> 04:20:08.560]   are incredibly kind, friendly, and supportive people.
[04:20:08.560 --> 04:20:12.160]   - Okay, and now your task with doing--
[04:20:12.160 --> 04:20:13.280]   - Talk about bad juju.
[04:20:13.280 --> 04:20:18.280]   - To practice what you preach,
[04:20:18.480 --> 04:20:21.040]   is there in your soul that you can find
[04:20:21.040 --> 04:20:22.960]   one beautiful thing to say about Yaron
[04:20:22.960 --> 04:20:25.440]   now that you guys met for the first, second,
[04:20:25.440 --> 04:20:27.520]   or third time, or at least in book format?
[04:20:27.520 --> 04:20:28.880]   - So that's an easy one.
[04:20:28.880 --> 04:20:33.880]   So what I like about Yaron is that I think he is taking,
[04:20:33.880 --> 04:20:38.160]   one of the problems with maybe more old school objectivism
[04:20:38.160 --> 04:20:42.760]   is that they would just use Ran's arguments in Ran's way.
[04:20:42.760 --> 04:20:45.080]   And it's like, you're a parrot, you're not adding anything,
[04:20:45.080 --> 04:20:46.720]   and you're not gonna be better than her.
[04:20:46.720 --> 04:20:50.360]   So you give this talk about, I think you can compare,
[04:20:50.360 --> 04:20:51.840]   was it Bill Gates to--
[04:20:51.840 --> 04:20:53.160]   - Michael Theresa.
[04:20:53.160 --> 04:20:55.000]   - No, no, who's the one who went to jail?
[04:20:55.000 --> 04:20:55.840]   - Oh, Bernie Madoff.
[04:20:55.840 --> 04:20:57.680]   - To Bernie Madoff, and you make the point,
[04:20:57.680 --> 04:20:59.960]   you're like, does anyone here really think
[04:20:59.960 --> 04:21:01.500]   Bernie Madoff was happy?
[04:21:01.500 --> 04:21:03.660]   Like, yeah, he's successful and he's wealthy,
[04:21:03.660 --> 04:21:06.040]   but does he go to bed being like, hey, I'm a great guy?
[04:21:06.040 --> 04:21:07.360]   No, and his son kills himself
[04:21:07.360 --> 04:21:08.920]   with all this tragedy that goes with him.
[04:21:08.920 --> 04:21:12.880]   So I think anyone who takes an ideology or worldview
[04:21:12.880 --> 04:21:16.080]   that I think is of value and adds to it
[04:21:16.080 --> 04:21:18.920]   and articulates it in a new way,
[04:21:18.920 --> 04:21:21.360]   I think is a great accomplishment.
[04:21:21.360 --> 04:21:26.200]   I like how uncompromising you are in your views,
[04:21:26.200 --> 04:21:29.480]   putting her views forward.
[04:21:29.480 --> 04:21:34.180]   And I like how you illustrate how silly it is
[04:21:34.180 --> 04:21:35.720]   to argue against anarchism.
[04:21:35.720 --> 04:21:37.680]   So I don't really have to do any of the work.
[04:21:37.680 --> 04:21:41.000]   As for you, and I've thought this before many times,
[04:21:41.000 --> 04:21:43.600]   you were the first person I met
[04:21:43.600 --> 04:21:46.280]   who I come at, literally the first,
[04:21:46.280 --> 04:21:48.560]   other than my friend who went to yeshiva with as a kid,
[04:21:48.560 --> 04:21:51.660]   who I come at us, there was a line on "Friends"
[04:21:51.660 --> 04:21:54.620]   where Ross and Rachel were thinking of dating, right?
[04:21:54.620 --> 04:21:56.920]   And they go, if we start dating,
[04:21:56.920 --> 04:21:58.920]   it would be like the third date
[04:21:58.920 --> 04:22:00.000]   'cause they knew each other well.
[04:22:00.000 --> 04:22:01.240]   And then she's like, yeah, but it'd be like,
[04:22:01.240 --> 04:22:02.440]   so it's like a plus and a minus.
[04:22:02.440 --> 04:22:04.360]   Like, yeah, you're fast forwarding to seriousness,
[04:22:04.360 --> 04:22:06.600]   but it's also the fact that you and I
[04:22:06.600 --> 04:22:08.280]   have the same background,
[04:22:08.280 --> 04:22:10.960]   like I can sit with your own or any of my other friends
[04:22:10.960 --> 04:22:12.120]   and try to explain it.
[04:22:12.120 --> 04:22:15.560]   The fact that intuitively you and I grew up the same
[04:22:15.560 --> 04:22:18.560]   and I know that we have that background in common
[04:22:18.560 --> 04:22:21.080]   does create a bond because I feel,
[04:22:21.080 --> 04:22:23.200]   even if I haven't told you certain things,
[04:22:23.200 --> 04:22:25.800]   you are going to understand me a lot better
[04:22:25.800 --> 04:22:28.280]   than many of my friends who've known me for a long time.
[04:22:28.280 --> 04:22:32.480]   I also really like how I feel,
[04:22:32.480 --> 04:22:34.680]   this is a very new age term, but I'm gonna use it.
[04:22:34.680 --> 04:22:37.560]   I feel very seen when I talk to you.
[04:22:37.560 --> 04:22:39.280]   I think you see me for who I am.
[04:22:39.280 --> 04:22:41.960]   You appreciate me for who I am.
[04:22:41.960 --> 04:22:45.320]   And I also really like how,
[04:22:45.320 --> 04:22:48.760]   and this is increasingly common as my platform increases.
[04:22:48.760 --> 04:22:52.320]   So I'm very flattered by this.
[04:22:52.320 --> 04:22:54.000]   You understand what I'm trying to do
[04:22:54.000 --> 04:22:55.920]   and you don't try to get in the way,
[04:22:55.920 --> 04:22:57.480]   even though it's your show.
[04:22:57.480 --> 04:22:59.640]   You're like, okay, this guy's a performer.
[04:22:59.640 --> 04:23:01.320]   He's doing his thing.
[04:23:01.320 --> 04:23:02.440]   People appreciate it.
[04:23:02.440 --> 04:23:03.680]   I appreciate it.
[04:23:03.680 --> 04:23:05.960]   I'm not gonna try to drive their car.
[04:23:05.960 --> 04:23:09.760]   And I think some people who are bad,
[04:23:09.760 --> 04:23:12.080]   and I've not encountered this 'cause I would shoot it down,
[04:23:12.080 --> 04:23:14.400]   but I think a lot of times people have a tendency
[04:23:14.400 --> 04:23:17.480]   when they're hosts to try to drive the car.
[04:23:17.480 --> 04:23:20.840]   And it's like, these things work when we come in here,
[04:23:20.840 --> 04:23:22.480]   none of us prepare, you're prepared by me,
[04:23:22.480 --> 04:23:26.000]   none of us talk beforehand and make it spontaneous.
[04:23:26.000 --> 04:23:27.720]   And the audience really enjoys that more
[04:23:27.720 --> 04:23:30.320]   'cause they know it's real earnest and dynamic.
[04:23:30.320 --> 04:23:32.800]   - Yeah, I enjoy having you drive the car,
[04:23:32.800 --> 04:23:35.240]   even though I believe you don't have a license.
[04:23:35.240 --> 04:23:37.400]   - And you think we're gonna crash.
[04:23:37.400 --> 04:23:39.760]   - No, I think he's an extraordinary interviewer
[04:23:39.760 --> 04:23:40.920]   because of all those things.
[04:23:40.920 --> 04:23:42.260]   He makes you feel visible.
[04:23:42.260 --> 04:23:47.200]   And he does, but he also comes across as really earnest.
[04:23:47.200 --> 04:23:50.640]   The questions are really questions
[04:23:50.640 --> 04:23:52.640]   that you seem really interested in,
[04:23:52.640 --> 04:23:56.600]   that you really want answers to.
[04:23:56.600 --> 04:23:58.480]   It doesn't come across as canned
[04:23:58.480 --> 04:24:02.320]   or I prepared my three book project questions.
[04:24:02.320 --> 04:24:04.360]   - Thank you, Michael.
[04:24:04.360 --> 04:24:07.220]   I was pretty sure that on a desert island,
[04:24:07.220 --> 04:24:10.960]   this would end in murder, but now I believe it may.
[04:24:10.960 --> 04:24:13.320]   - Well, given his comments on anarchy, it might still.
[04:24:13.320 --> 04:24:14.160]   - It's gonna be human-sensitive.
[04:24:14.160 --> 04:24:15.000]   - It might still.
[04:24:15.000 --> 04:24:15.840]   - It might still.
[04:24:15.840 --> 04:24:17.920]   - Might still, the day is young.
[04:24:17.920 --> 04:24:18.760]   The night is young.
[04:24:18.760 --> 04:24:19.680]   - This is just the beginning.
[04:24:19.680 --> 04:24:20.760]   - This is a huge honor.
[04:24:20.760 --> 04:24:23.480]   I've been a fan of both of you separately for a long time.

[04:24:53.660 --> 04:24:55.500]   "people who make you laugh,
