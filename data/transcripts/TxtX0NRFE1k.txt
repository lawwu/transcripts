[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.420]   - Let's move on.
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.240]   What do we got?
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.180]   - Okay, moving on here.
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.940]   We got a question.
[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.540]   Basically, he has a question about,
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.980]   he thinks that your mom might be a computer scientist
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.820]   and she--
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.980]   - She was a computer programmer.
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.620]   - Okay, so he's got a question about that
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.940]   and types of values she instilled in you.
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.180]   - All right.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.360]   - Hey Cal, this is Michael from Falls Church, Virginia.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.380]   I recently read in one of the magazine articles of yours,
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.940]   I think it was in New Yorker,
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.740]   you said your mother was a computer scientist.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.300]   So I can imagine she must have instilled some values
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.860]   and habits into you that are different
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.940]   from most mothers your generation growing up.
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.980]   Could you probably share some of these values
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.980]   and habits that she instilled in you
[00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.420]   that helped shape who you are today?
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.020]   Thanks and I hope to see you at an in-person event
[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.960]   or a talk or a bookstore around DC one of these days.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.140]   - Well, yeah, first of all, to your second point, yes,
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.860]   we should hope to see you in person at some point
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.180]   once Jesse and I get our act together
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.020]   to organize something.
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.060]   Falls Church is not too far from here,
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.220]   so that would be great.
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.060]   Yeah, so my mom, the article you're talking about
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.140]   was an article I wrote early in the pandemic
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.980]   about remote work.
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.260]   She wasn't a computer scientist,
[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.820]   she was a computer programmer, COBOL programmer
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.380]   on series seven IBM mainframes for the Houston Chronicle
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.660]   back when we was born and raised in Texas.
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.700]   And so, yes, so I talked about in that article
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.980]   the fact that she was one of the first remote workers
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.620]   and they had set up a terminal,
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.740]   but that's important for your question
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.140]   because what it meant was is we had computers,
[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.220]   personal computers in our house in the '80s
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.500]   at a relatively early period,
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.140]   because again, as a very early remote worker,
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.780]   she had a personal computer that she could connect
[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.900]   into the mainframe and program from home there in Houston.
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.820]   So we had computers in our house in a very early age.
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.300]   So that had an impact on my interest in computers
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.140]   and eventually in computer science,
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.580]   because I could ask her what she's doing
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.100]   and she'd tell me what computer programming was.
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.420]   I knew what computer programming was.
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.500]   We had computers in the house.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.540]   So at a pretty early age, I started computer programming.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.300]   And I got pretty deeply into that.
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.340]   And that set up my whole computer science career.
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.340]   Of course, ironically, as soon as I got to MIT
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.300]   in grad school, I said, "I'm done with computer programming.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.300]   "I wanna be a theoretician."
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.540]   And I haven't programmed a computer since, more or less,
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.860]   but that was very useful.
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.060]   The other influence here, and I'm gonna say right now,
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.380]   I'm just focusing on influences relevant
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.020]   to my public professional life.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.420]   Obviously, there's very important influences on my values
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.620]   and me as a person and character,
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.660]   but I don't wanna get into all of that right now.
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.580]   But in terms of things that are publicly visible
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.820]   in my professional life, the other important thing
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.620]   that I got out of my mom is that when we moved,
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.900]   we moved to New Jersey, and I have three siblings,
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.740]   so there's four of us.
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.220]   And we moved to New Jersey, she stopped working
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.180]   for the Houston Chronicle and was just helping
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.180]   to raise the kids because we were at an age
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.860]   where it's four kids, it's a really hard job.
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.700]   And we generated a lot of chaos.
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.740]   There's a lot of paperwork and things that happen
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.580]   when you move.
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.020]   And my memory was it was quite overwhelming
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.020]   until one of her friends sold her on a Franklin Planner.
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.300]   It was like the Franklin Planner
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.620]   is a productivity organizational system
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.660]   that was in particular quite popular in the '80s and '90s.
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.780]   And she got very organized, and it made all the difference
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.620]   in the world.
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.140]   And it went from chaos, like a completely organized
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.460]   household, a completely organized childhood,
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.100]   in a way that was very impressive and very comforting.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.900]   So I had been exposed all throughout my childhood
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.500]   to the power of being structured and organized
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.540]   in terms of your calendar, your to-do list, your days,
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.060]   your plan for what should happen.
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.340]   There's a lot of ideas from that original
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.700]   Franklin Covey system that permeate
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.220]   the time management systems I talk about today.
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.420]   Looking to the week ahead, figuring out in advance
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.860]   when things were gonna happen, full capture of things.
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.740]   You had all the information in place.
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.180]   Avoiding the chaos of what do I wanna do next,
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.260]   and instead having the structure of what's my plan
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.100]   for the day.
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.900]   A lot of that I saw happening as we were growing up.
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.460]   And it meant a very stable, structured household.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.980]   Oh, it's this holiday happening,
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.260]   those decorations come out, there's these events we do,
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.820]   everyone gets their, we gotta get clothes for the kids,
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.020]   that was a big thing, because you grow out of your clothes
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.580]   so fast, and my mom would bring down the catalogs,
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.700]   be like, okay, you have to go through
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.580]   and circle what you want, and there would be the day
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.020]   she called and ordered it.
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.020]   And that, I think I took to heart for sure.
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.020]   And that would lead me to be someone that had productivity
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.740]   and productivity systems instilled in my DNA.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.540]   So those are my two things I will say,
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.020]   in terms of my mom's influence on my public,
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.340]   my public, professional, visible lifestyle.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.460]   Me as a computer scientist, and me as someone
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.620]   that does some productivity guru-ing,
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.940]   that goes back to her.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.300]   Nice, good question.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.900]   (upbeat music)
