[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the message of that sixth chapter,
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.760]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles, which we have read at the beginning.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.000]   I find it difficult to take any particular verse as my text tonight, as I rather want
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.640]   to review the message of the entire chapter taken as a whole.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.840]   It reads at the beginning like this, you remember.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.400]   And in those days when the number of disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.640]   the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.260]   And again we read in verse seven, the word of God increased, and the number of the disciples
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.160]   multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, and a great company of the priests were obedient to the
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.160]   faith.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.160]   And then in the second half of the chapter, from verse nine to the end, we read against
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.480]   opposition, rising against the gospel.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.680]   Now, those who meet here regularly will know that we've been looking at this chapter for
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.000]   five previous Sunday evenings, and are therefore examining it tonight for the sixth time.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.840]   And I've been at pains to point out Sunday by Sunday what an important chapter it is.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.020]   It's a very important chapter for a number of reasons.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.560]   It's interesting from the mere standpoint of church government and church order.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.900]   Here you see the beginning of the diaconate of deacons in the life and the organization
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.480]   of the church.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.180]   But it's much more important for another reason, and that's the one that we've been
[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.540]   concentrating on.
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.620]   It really did constitute a turning point in the whole history of the church.
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.620]   The church here met a temptation, and if she had succumbed and fallen to the temptation,
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.980]   it would have made a very great difference to the whole story of Christianity.
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.540]   Indeed, it's doubtful whether there would have been a story at all if they had fallen
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.320]   to the temptation at this point.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.260]   The temptation came, in other words, over this whole question of looking after the widows.
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.100]   The numbers had increased, there were many widows in the company.
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.660]   These were all people who'd believed the gospel and had been converted, their lives
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.420]   had been changed and had become Christians.
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.980]   And it was their habit at that time to look after the poor and the maimed and the widows
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.980]   and so on.
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.660]   The church has always done this, the church has always been the leader in all work amongst
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.420]   the poor and the suffering, the leader in education and culture and in many other things.
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.420]   That's often forgotten.
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.240]   Well, here we're reminded of that.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.340]   But now it constituted a problem.
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.740]   And these Greek-speaking Christians, you remember, began to complain that their widows were not
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.180]   being given the same fair treatment as were the widows of the Hebrew-speaking Christians.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.420]   And the problem was brought to the apostles with the expectation that they would leave
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.340]   everything to look after this.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.540]   But you remember they didn't.
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.100]   And here they established once and forever that the primary task of the church is to
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.100]   preach the gospel, not to change social conditions, not to do acts of kindness and of mercy.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.140]   Yes, that's all right, that is to be done, and as I say, the church has always done it,
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.520]   but it is not the primary task.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.860]   It is not reason that we leave the Word of God and serve tables.
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.280]   That establishes this great principle.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.780]   Then we've been considering what the message is.
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.420]   And then we've seen why these men felt that they must give themselves continually to prayer
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.660]   as well as to the ministry of the Word.
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.620]   Nothing can be done here apart from the power of God.
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.180]   And then last Sunday night we were considering how one becomes a Christian, and it is through
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.980]   giving obedience to the faith.
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.420]   Now we've been looking at those various aspects, and it's all here, you see, it's very fundamental
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.420]   doctrine.
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.420]   Here is the early church, and let me remind you again that we're really studying these
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.260]   early chapters of Acts for that one reason, that we're anxious to know what Christianity
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.500]   really is, what the church is, what's it all about.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.060]   There's such confusion today in the world as to what the church is, what are messages.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:41.060]   And here is the only authentic answer, and this is what we must accept therefore as authoritative.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.940]   And it calls upon us to obey it, not merely to give it a passing glance, not merely to
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.020]   give some emotional response which we forget the next day.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.820]   No, no, it is obedience with the mind, the heart, the will, the whole man gives himself
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.820]   to it.
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.340]   Well, now that's the point at which we've arrived, but I want this evening to look at
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.980]   it in this way.
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.140]   I want to look at it as a whole.
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.140]   I want to look at the church and her message as a whole, and I want to do so in particular
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:21.900]   in the light of this opposition that arose to this gospel as we are told.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.500]   Then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the Libertines
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.460]   and Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen,
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.340]   one of these men who had been chosen to do this particular work.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.060]   Now, why do I do this?
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:47.220]   Well, I do so for this reason, that I want to try to show you the essential character
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.220]   of this gospel, this message.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:06:00.940]   I have a feeling that our main trouble today is that we forget the true nature of the gospel.
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:08.180]   We forget that it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believe it.
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.580]   I think that's the main charge that will be brought against this generation.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.900]   Not only those who are outside the church and who don't believe the gospel.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.660]   I think it will be the main charge brought against many of us inside the church, that
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:29.220]   we have reduced the gospel to something human, sometimes even very poor human.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.900]   And we've missed the glory and the greatness and the grandeur of it all.
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:41.540]   Now, you see, it's because we have missed the essential nature of the gospel that we
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.220]   tend to put such emphasis upon the modern man.
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.620]   That's all you hear today, isn't it?
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.620]   The modern man.
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.900]   He's to control everything.
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.500]   Some emphasize modern men's knowledge.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.260]   They say it's no use preaching as you used to preach, no use preaching from the Bible,
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.300]   no use preaching the old message, because modern men, modern men with his knowledge,
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.100]   scientific knowledge and so on, you're familiar with all this.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.100]   Many start there.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.900]   And this is the thing that controls all their thinking.
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.580]   Modern men, here he is with this great knowledge.
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:22.260]   Then others, of course, say almost the exact opposite, and they're telling us that the
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260]   thing we've got to realize is modern men's ignorance.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:31.860]   They say, of course, there are some men who fall into your first category, the scientists,
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.580]   philosophers, great thinkers and so on, but they say, you know, the masses of the people,
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.220]   they're not like that at all.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.220]   They're just sheer ignorant.
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.220]   They know nothing.
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.060]   They're ignorant of all these terms.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:50.660]   They don't know what they mean, and the church is failing today because she doesn't understand
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.940]   the situation of the average person.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.500]   There is this appalling ignorance of all these things.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.460]   There's the second emphasis.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:05.620]   Then there are others who tell us that we must be paying great attention to what people
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.620]   like.
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.340]   They say, you go on preaching like that in the old way.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.340]   People don't like preaching.
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.340]   They like pictures.
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.340]   They like singing.
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.340]   They like entertainment.
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.340]   They like drama.
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.780]   Oh, they say, you see, you've got to take people as they are.
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.140]   You've got to understand their likes and dislikes and so on.
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:29.380]   Now, as a result of all that kind of thinking, the whole emphasis in this century has been,
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.420]   some put an emphasis on what they call the need of a new message.
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:37.860]   This is the great emphasis amongst the intellectuals.
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:42.380]   You are intelligent people, and I know you look at your television.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:48.260]   I'm not saying you're intelligent because you do that, but you do as intelligent people,
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:54.500]   and you have heard people—I happened to listen to one only this last week talking
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.100]   about secular Christianity.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:02.260]   I hope most of you heard that because I think it's very good for us to hear the alternatives
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.700]   that are being put forward to this gospel.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.380]   How pathetic it is.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.220]   Well, here it is.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:14.300]   The argument is that you need what they call secular Christianity.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.900]   You must get rid of the supernatural and all that.
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:22.260]   We want a new message, so they're trying to work out a new gospel.
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.540]   This is to appeal to the modern scientific men, who doesn't believe in the supernatural
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.540]   and the miraculous.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:34.940]   Well, then others, you see, go to the opposite extreme, as they say—as I say, and they're
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:40.060]   the people who advocate new translations of the Bible, and they come out one after another.
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.340]   This is all you need, they say.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.100]   Tom, Dick, and Harry don't understand the authorized version, that's why he doesn't
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.100]   believe the message.
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:52.100]   Give him new translations, new English Bible, so-and-so's translation of the New Testament,
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.100]   or this.
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.180]   Once the people get it in a language that they commonly use—the language of the kitchen,
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.780]   if you like, or even the kitchen sink—then they'll believe this message.
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:02.780]   You're familiar with that emphasis.
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.380]   Then there are others who say, "No, that isn't what we need.
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.900]   What we need is more entertainment.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.900]   People like entertainment.
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:11.900]   Let them have that.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.900]   That's the way."
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:18.180]   Once you come down to their level, and do things that they normally do, and slip in
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.100]   your gospel, as it were, that's the way to succeed with the modern men.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.200]   Well, I don't want to weary you with all this, but all I'm trying to show you, my
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.060]   dear friends, is that take every one of them—I don't care which of them—take them all
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.060]   together.
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.340]   There is one thing that we can say about them all.
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:40.540]   They have never seen the greatness of this gospel.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.620]   They have never seen its glory.
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.340]   I object to them all that they're making something small of it, something ordinary,
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:52.740]   something cheap, something easy, and it doesn't.
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:58.580]   This one chapter alone is enough to give the lie direct to all this modern thinking, for
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:04.060]   it holds before us the greatness, the glory of it all.
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.640]   What is it?
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.560]   This is the power of God unto salvation.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.540]   You don't start with men; you must start with God.
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.860]   If you start with men, well then, of course, you'll do what I've been describing.
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.020]   You'll be interested in new messages, or in new methods, or in psychological approaches,
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.740]   or this or that, and it's all a travesty of the gospel, and indeed I feel it's an
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.140]   insult to the gospel.
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:33.620]   This is the charge, I fear, that the modern Christian will probably have to face as the
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:42.140]   bar of eternal judgment, that he has reduced this glorious gospel to the level of modern
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:48.140]   men, he's cheapened it, he's missed the essential greatness and glory.
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:54.740]   Well now, here I say we are shown, especially in the second half of this chapter, where
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:12:02.420]   you see the gospel in conflict with opposition, its essential nature, which is its essential
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.660]   bigness, its greatness, its glory.
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.100]   How does it show us that?
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:16.780]   Well, I'm confining myself this evening strictly to this one chapter, and here we
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.500]   are given a glimpse of it.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:25.820]   I want to show you tonight something of the glory of this gospel, even in its method,
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.260]   in its very method.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:34.940]   Now there's all this talk and interest today in method, new methods, this is the thing.
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.700]   How can we get it over?
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:42.260]   Form of communication, methods, everybody talking about methods, and all this expenditure
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.860]   of energy on methods.
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:49.020]   Oh, let's go back to the New Testament, let's go back to this book of Acts, and
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.180]   here we'll see the method.
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.340]   What is the method of this glorious gospel?
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.460]   Well, there are two main things that are told us here about it.
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:04.380]   The first is that it is the proclamation of a word, and it's the proclamation of a word
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.980]   which is truth.
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:14.380]   It is not written that we should leave the word of God and serve tables.
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:21.460]   We will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word.
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:26.380]   Or in this dispute that took place between Stephen and the others, we are told they were
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:31.500]   not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.240]   He was speaking to them, he was teaching, he was expounding.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:41.540]   Now here is the method of the gospel, not interested in gadgets, not interested in entertainment.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.980]   Its whole emphasis is upon its message, upon its word.
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.300]   Now this is the claim of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:55.260]   You remember our Lord on a famous occasion had been preaching and had been going back
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:00.100]   to Baal a little and giving a glimpse to the people of the relationship between the Father
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:06.100]   and himself, and we are told that as he spake these words many believed in him.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:12.900]   And then we go on to read, "Then said he, said Jesus, and to those which believed in
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:21.100]   him, 'If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed, and ye shall know
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:27.200]   the truth, and the truth shall make you free.'"
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.740]   What makes a man free?
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.740]   Physical experience?
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:31.740]   Certainly not.
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.740]   What is it?
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:39.260]   Oh, it's this truth, this word, the truth shall make you free, and there's nothing
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:44.980]   under the sun tonight that can make men truly free except this word, the word of the apostles,
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.620]   the word of the gospel.
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.860]   We know that men are enslaved, but you don't start with men, we know that.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:58.020]   But what we need to consider is what we have to give to men, and it is this word, this
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:03.860]   truth, or again take our Lord in his high priestly prayer.
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:10.840]   He says, "Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth."
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:17.580]   What is it that sanctifies us, delivers us from sin and its thralldom and its bondage?
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.140]   What is it that makes us more and more like the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.700]   Well, it is the truth.
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.780]   It is this word.
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.660]   Now this is the method of the gospel, you see.
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:34.060]   It puts its faith in this, the very character of the message.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:38.140]   In other words, it is a teaching, it is an instruction.
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:43.460]   It is an enlightenment, it is the imparting of knowledge.
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.740]   Now the modern man doesn't like this, we are told.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:47.740]   He likes entertainment.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.780]   Well, I don't care what the modern man likes.
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:54.660]   All I'm saying is this, that it isn't what the modern man likes nor wants is what matters,
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.740]   it is what he needs.
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:01.620]   And what the modern man needs is knowledge, he needs enlightenment.
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.300]   Man by nature is ignorant, he is in sin, he doesn't know.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.620]   He says there is no God.
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.580]   The fool hath said in his heart there is no God.
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:15.940]   He needs instruction, he needs enlightenment, he needs to have knowledge.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.260]   And this is what the modern man needs.
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.500]   It is why you are starting with what the modern man wants and then trying to conform to him.
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.100]   That's an insult to the truth of God.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:30.180]   We are called to proclaim the truth, to be heralds of the gospel.
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:35.460]   Whether men hear or whether they shall forbear, says God as he gives his commission to Jeremiah,
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:42.500]   and I believe the same commission is given to every true preacher of the gospel in 1966.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.180]   Modern man is not the judge of what he needs, he doesn't know.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.660]   Look at his world, he doesn't understand.
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:53.860]   He needs knowledge, and he's got to be taught, and he's got to be instructed, the truth,
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:54.860]   the word.
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.140]   Here's the first thing in the method.
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:05.740]   But you notice that there is a second thing, and it is power.
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.740]   And this is most important, power.
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:18.460]   Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.980]   On later we are told about these people who opposed him, they were not able to resist
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:28.340]   the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:33.140]   Now my friends, here is the thing we need to regrasp.
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:39.700]   This is a teaching, it is as I say the impartation of knowledge.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.020]   But there is this essential difference.
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.900]   This is the thing that differentiates this from everything else that is being offered
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.100]   to the world tonight, and that is why the method of the preacher should be essentially
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.540]   different from that of the politician or the salesman.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.680]   The politician and the salesman are anxious to please people.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.500]   It is the essence of wisdom if you're trying to sell a commodity, or if you're a politician,
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.740]   to appeal to people, to come to their level and to give them what they want.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.700]   That's the whole art of these things, but you know it's got nothing to do with this.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.700]   Why not?
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.700]   Well for this reason.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:19.740]   There in the realm of politics or salesmanship, it all depends upon human ability and human
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.320]   persuasion.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.500]   It doesn't here.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:29.340]   Human persuasion can do nothing here, nothing at all.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:34.260]   A man may be full of ability in this matter, he may be a born salesman, he may be an orator,
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:39.460]   he may be a reasoner, an arguer, he may do these things almost to perfection, but he
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:43.100]   can never say ever so, never, impossible.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:49.660]   Here there is the need of something deeper, something greater, something profounder, and
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.420]   thank God we've got it.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:57.620]   And that is why we needn't consider methods or borrow the methods of big business or anybody
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:58.620]   else.
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:07.140]   Stephen, full of faith and of power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.140]   Power?
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.140]   What power is this?
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.380]   Well we are told about him earlier on.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:15.260]   The disciples is confronted by this problem of the widows.
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:20.540]   They said, "Wherefore brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.900]   of the Holy Ghost and of wisdom."
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:30.980]   We read later, "And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost."
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.860]   And it was because he was filled with the Holy Ghost, he was filled with power.
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:39.940]   Power not only to work wonders and miracles, but power in his speech.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.660]   Here are these clever people rising up against him, and here is one man standing against
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:45.660]   them all.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:52.300]   And they were unable to respond, well the power, the spirit with which he spoke.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:20:00.440]   Let me put this in another form, because this is the thing that we need to start with.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:06.740]   The method of the gospel is the method of the supernatural power of the Spirit of God.
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:12.080]   It's nothing less, because nothing less would be of the slightest value.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.540]   Did you notice what I read to you at the beginning in that first epistle of Peter, how Peter
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:22.340]   there, years later, writing a letter, puts it like this, "Unto whom it was revealed that
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:28.060]   not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:35.980]   unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you, with the Holy Ghost sent down from
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:36.980]   heaven."
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:42.180]   That's the thing, the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.540]   The epistle to the Hebrews puts exactly the same message in the second chapter in these
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:47.540]   words.
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:52.740]   "How shall we escape," says this man, "if we neglect so great salvation, which at the
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:59.620]   first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him,
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:05.540]   God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders and divers miracles and gifts
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.800]   of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will."
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.980]   Now this is the method of the gospel.
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:17.180]   Not asking what do men like, what do men want, let's give them that, and reducing the glorious—no,
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.180]   no.
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:25.260]   The truth, and the truth in the power of the gospel, the Spirit.
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:32.940]   This is, let me indicate quite clearly, a supernatural gospel, a supernatural message.
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.380]   It is miraculous, that's the whole point about it.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:41.360]   That's why it is what it is, that's why it's done what it's done, that's why it's going
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.760]   to do what it's going to do, as I'm going to show you.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:49.480]   You see, we are dealing here with what Paul described in writing to the Romans in these
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.480]   words.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.880]   He says, "I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ."
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.760]   He wasn't ashamed of it.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:00.440]   He was writing to Rome, where the emperor lived, the seat of government, all the important
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.440]   people.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.440]   There they were, Rome.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.060]   He says, "I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ."
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.060]   Why not?
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:13.440]   The answer is, it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth, to the
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.720]   Jew first, and also to the Greek.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.640]   You see, this is no human teaching, this is no mere philosophy.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:28.700]   This is God's truth, and he sends his Spirit upon it, and the Spirit does the work.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:33.900]   It is the Spirit alone that can enlighten a man, it is the Spirit alone that can change
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.900]   a man.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.680]   It's a miraculous, supernatural gospel.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.740]   And if the modern man tells me he doesn't believe in the supernatural, I say, "So much
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.300]   for the modern man."
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:50.300]   And that's why he and his world are as they are, and there is no hope to him, for him
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:56.540]   until he realizes his powerless condition, and in his utter helplessness cries out unto
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:03.020]   the Lord, and begins to experience the power of this blessed Spirit of whom we read in
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.020]   this chapter.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:10.420]   Very well, there is the very method of the gospel, and do you see how different it is
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:17.440]   from so much that is talked of and is popular today, all of the cheapening of this, the
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.980]   reduction of the message, and the reliance upon human methods and experience, instead
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:28.420]   upon the power of the Spirit of the living God?
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.420]   But let me show you also.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:36.140]   The greatness and the glory of this gospel is you see it in the work that it does in
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:40.340]   the believer, and this is amazing.
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:47.120]   We've got much too cheap an idea as to what a Christian is.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.660]   If you only look at this chapter, you'll see what a Christian is, and you'll see that
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:56.980]   a Christian is a man who's been dealt with by this supernatural and miraculous power,
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:02.820]   and it is something that has changed him, and changed him completely, not a superficial
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:07.260]   decision, not just a little improvement here or there, not that a man stops doing this
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.260]   and takes up that.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:12.340]   No, no, that's true of course, but that's merely the surface of it.
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.340]   Oh, what is it?
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.180]   It's being born again.
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.440]   It is being made anew.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.140]   It is being created afresh.
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:25.180]   It is something that God does again as he did in the original creation, brings something
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.260]   new into being out of nothing.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.380]   That's Christianity, and nothing less.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.540]   No, no, there's no other definition of Christianity.
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.140]   A Christian is a man who has been born again.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.340]   Our Lord taught it to Nicodemus.
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.900]   We mustn't reduce this.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.820]   Nothing less is of any value.
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:48.940]   You don't decide to be a Christian, you are made a Christian, and you are made a Christian
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:53.060]   by nothing less than the Spirit of God himself.
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.900]   Well now then, let me show you this.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.180]   What does it do?
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.500]   Well now, I simply want to call your attention to different terms that are used in this one
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.500]   chapter.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:07.060]   Take the first of all, this term, brethren.
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:13.500]   In the third verse, the Apostles say, "Wherefore, brethren, look you out among you seven men
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:19.620]   of honest reportful of the Holy Ghost," but they're addressing these people as "brethren."
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.500]   This is the most wonderful word.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.500]   Who are these brethren?
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:28.860]   Well, they actually came from different nations.
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.820]   In Jerusalem at this time, there were people from different parts of the world.
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:37.060]   We're given an account of them earlier in this book, and later on you'll find the same
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.540]   thing.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.540]   Different nations.
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:47.860]   Greek speaking, Hebrew speaking, some were actual Greeks, some were actual Jews, some
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:48.860]   were Romans.
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.580]   That's the marvelous thing, you see, about the early church.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:57.580]   It broke down all the barriers, middle walls of partition, these barriers that nations
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.660]   erect between one another, and they quarrel and they don't speak.
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:07.940]   This gospel demolishes, brings down middle walls of partition, and makes brethren, Jew
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:15.260]   and Gentile, Greek and Barbarian, Romans and Scythians, all are made brethren.
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.420]   What an astounding thing.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.620]   You see, that's the great problem in the modern world, isn't it?
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.100]   We talk about our great advances.
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.340]   Where's the advance, my friends?
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:30.260]   The nations were quarreling 2,000 years ago, they're still doing it.
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.700]   Where's your advance?
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.700]   What have we learned?
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.700]   We don't seem to have learned how to live together, do we?
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:40.420]   Not how to love, not how to respect one another, but here is something that can bring men of
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:45.900]   different nationalities together, brethren, members of the same family, but not only different
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.260]   nationalities, people of different callings.
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:55.220]   I was emphasizing last Sunday night how many amongst the priests became believers, but
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.940]   also there were fishermen.
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.540]   These apostles were mainly fishermen, men of all types and kinds.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:09.380]   Here they are, brethren, believers together, sharing all things in common, brethren.
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.500]   Not only that, but obviously men of different abilities.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:19.140]   It's very wonderful to notice in the New Testament alone, the great variation in the
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.140]   abilities of these people.
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:24.500]   You've got a towering genius like the apostle Paul, although Peter was a very impulsive
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.620]   and a strong character, but I don't think you'd give him very high marks in the matter
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.620]   of sheer intellect.
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:33.780]   No, no, he was a fisherman, he was an ordinary man, and yet they're brethren.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:38.300]   He talks about his beloved brother Paul, and Paul would doubtless have referred to him
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.480]   in the same terms.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.480]   What am I making?
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.220]   What's the point I'm making?
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:50.180]   Oh, it's just this, my friend, this term "brethren" is the answer to most of the modern misunderstanding
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.540]   of the gospel.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:58.100]   The gospel of Jesus Christ doesn't care about your antecedents at all.
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.500]   The gospel of Jesus Christ doesn't say as you come in, "What nationality do you belong
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.500]   to?
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.500]   What's the color of your skin?
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.500]   Or what is your background?
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:07.840]   What's your cultural background?"
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.380]   Not interested.
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.560]   The gospel of Jesus Christ doesn't say, "Have you matriculated or not?
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.460]   Have you done your, what is it, O level, A level, or haven't you?"
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.780]   It doesn't matter, not the slightest difference.
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.760]   It doesn't say, "Can you read the latest textbook on philosophy?
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:28.780]   Can you understand the latest textbook on astronomy, or on some abstruse branch of mathematics?"
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:29.780]   Not interested.
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:30.780]   Doesn't matter at all.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.340]   It doesn't say, "What's your political allegiance?"
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.340]   Not interested.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.980]   None of these things matter at all.
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:37.980]   Why?
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.860]   Well, because we are dealing with the power of God.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.220]   And when you're dealing with the power of God, these things don't matter at all.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:50.460]   You see, the attack upon the gospel in this century has come very powerfully from the
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:54.300]   realm and the direction of psychology.
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.380]   The argument is, "Oh yes, it's all right, certain people are religious.
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.380]   They're born like that.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.580]   You can't help it.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.020]   If you're born like that, well, you'll be religious.
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:08.180]   If you are, all right, we don't want to quarrel with you, but don't say that I should be religious."
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.180]   That's the argument.
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:14.340]   It's dismissed in terms of temperament, natural makeup, and psychology.
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:20.220]   But here's the answer, brethren, different nationalities, different backgrounds, different
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:26.780]   abilities, different understandings, different everything, it doesn't matter at all.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.660]   It doesn't matter what you are, what you've been, what you've done.
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:33.340]   You may have come into this service tonight a paragon of all the virtues, or you may have
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.740]   come out of one of the gutters of London.
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:41.180]   I'm proud to be able to say this to you, it doesn't matter at all.
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:46.340]   You're made one by this gospel, you're one in your failure, you're one in your sin, you're
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.900]   one in your ignorance of God, you're one in your helplessness.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:50.900]   It doesn't matter.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.900]   Nothing matters.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:30:00.460]   This gospel makes brethren of all types and conditions of men, temperament, psychology,
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:05.740]   nationality, all of these things are completely irrelevant throughout the running centuries
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:13.060]   in the same church as brethren together, you get all these diverse types in every conceivable
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.060]   respect.
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:18.180]   But the Holy Ghost makes them one.
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.700]   Brethren, what a gospel.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.780]   And then notice the second term.
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:28.820]   I find it here several places, it's in the first verse, "And in those days when the number
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:36.420]   of the disciples was multiplied," disciples, "then the Twelve called the multitude of the
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:40.360]   disciples unto them and said," what does this mean?
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:48.580]   Well this means learners, people who are learning, scholars if you like, pupils.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.300]   And this is another very wonderful thing.
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:55.620]   And you know it gives the lie direct to the modern approach, indeed it makes it quite
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:56.620]   laughable.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:01.220]   You see the modern approach says, well now there are those people, Tom, Dick, and Harry,
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:05.100]   they know nothing about the gospel, they don't understand the authorized version and its
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.100]   language.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:12.140]   Must come down to their level, must speak that language, they can't, it's impossible.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:17.780]   You know that's a lie my friend, that if you are going to reduce your gospel or your message
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:23.340]   or even vary your methods because of that argument, you are denying this essential teaching.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.380]   Disciples, learners.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.580]   These people are learners.
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:29.580]   Well who are they?
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:36.100]   Well I've told you some of them have already been described as unlearned and ignorant men.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:42.080]   When they perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:47.100]   You see there was no primary education, leave alone secondary education, leave alone university
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.660]   education at this time.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:55.020]   These were fishermen, began to help their fathers with the boats and the nets almost
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.500]   as soon as they could crawl around the ground.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:01.100]   And here they are, they'd been brought up to work like this, they'd never read a book,
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.540]   a textbook, they hadn't got such things.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:07.900]   We've got to cast our minds back, you know this modern thinking it's so wrong, it thinks
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.540]   that there's never been a time before this 20th century.
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:15.240]   Go back to the first century, consider the conditions, how did anybody become a Christian?
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.360]   But these people have become learners, disciples.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.780]   What is this?
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:26.840]   Oh it's the same thing you see, it's this miracle of redemption, it's this rebirth,
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.620]   it is this power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:35.980]   The Holy Spirit can make any man new, doesn't matter who he is.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:41.300]   The Holy Spirit can regenerate an ignoramus quite as easily as a great philosopher, perhaps
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.660]   even more so.
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:47.100]   But he can do the same with birth, it's he alone who can do it in both cases, and when
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:51.300]   he does so he does exactly the same thing to both of them, he creates a desire and an
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.820]   appetite in them for the truth.
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:33:01.740]   The moment a man becomes a Christian, the moment a man is regenerate, he has a desire
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.780]   to know more about the truth.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:11.980]   Now Peter later writing his epistle, he puts it like that you remember, "As newborn babes
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:17.060]   desire the sincere milk of the word, that he may grow thereby."
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.660]   But he writing that remembered what had happened at the beginning.
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:25.500]   You remember how we saw at the end of the second chapter of this book this, about those
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:31.220]   people who believed the preaching of this apostle on the day of Pentecost, "Then they
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:38.220]   that gladly received his word were baptized, and the same day they were added unto them
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:46.140]   about three thousand souls," listen, "and they, these three thousand souls, continued
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:53.300]   steadfastly," in what, "in the apostles teaching, doctrine, teaching, breaking of
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:57.840]   bread, fellowship, and breaking of bread, and in prayer."
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:02.140]   But the thing that is put first is the teaching, the doctrine.
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:09.380]   These people suddenly converted from ignorance and darkness, from the vileness of their lives,
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.380]   what do they want?
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.380]   Well they want more teaching.
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:15.620]   They've got an appetite and a desire for teaching.
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.420]   Have you ever heard of such a thing?
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:22.140]   People who'd never read, who'd never thought, people who'd lived for gambling and for sex
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:26.580]   and for drunkenness, people who didn't seem to have brains at all, suddenly they want
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.580]   teaching.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.580]   They say, "Let's have more of this."
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.140]   They did it daily, they continued steadfastly.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:35.380]   We are told later that they did it daily, they continuing daily with one accord in the
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.380]   temple.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:40.100]   Now this is the miracle of redemption, you see.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.160]   And this is the proof of the fact that a man has become a Christian.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.620]   Many people have taken decisions, but they don't want to be taught.
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:50.180]   They don't like teaching, they grumble at it, they say sermons are too long, and they
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:55.020]   want something nice and simple, and something bright and breezy, and something, "Oh, but
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:58.660]   you know when a man's made a Christian, when a man is born again he wants teaching.
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:03.420]   He's a disciple, he's got an appetite, he wants to know, he wants to grow, he wants
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.420]   to learn.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:05.420]   It's inevitable.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:10.620]   The new principle is put into whatever he wants by nature."
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:17.180]   But you see it not only puts within him the desire for teaching, it gives him a faculty
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.340]   which enables him to receive it.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:25.700]   This is a most wonderful thing, and a glory in this.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:30.780]   You see, if you followed the modern ideas, you would think that no man can possibly understand
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:35.280]   the great teaching of the gospel unless he's an expert philosopher, or scientist, or many
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.280]   other things.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.580]   It's very difficult to understand their books.
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:44.060]   It's very difficult to follow their statements on the television and in other places.
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:47.140]   But you know, that's a proof that they're not teaching the gospel.
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.540]   The common people heard him gladly.
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:52.180]   They listened to the Son of God and they could follow him.
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.460]   Ah, this is the whole secret.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:36:00.420]   That's how John puts it in his first epistle in these words.
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:05.580]   It doesn't matter what you are by nature, it doesn't matter whether you're poor in
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:11.380]   brain power, whether you're ignorant in learning, once you get this new life you'll not only
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:15.140]   want the teaching, you'll be able to receive it.
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.700]   You see, I'm told that the average person today can't take it.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:23.700]   And yet I think, let me say this for the glory of God, that this one place of worship alone
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.420]   gives the lie direct to it.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:29.340]   There have been people who've come in here knowing nothing, and yet they've listened
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.540]   to me preaching for an hour and they've got something out of it.
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:36.540]   At first they tell me afterwards, I didn't get much at first but I felt something.
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.980]   I knew I was getting something and I wanted more of it.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.580]   I knew it was reality and I had a hunger for it within me.
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.460]   And gradually they began to get it.
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.460]   Why?
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.460]   Well John gives us the answer.
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.700]   He's warning these people, he says, "Little children, it is the last time."
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:57.140]   And as you have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now there are many Antichrists
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.540]   whereby we know that it is the last time.
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:03.940]   They went out from us but they were not of us, for if they had been of us they would
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.580]   no doubt have continued with us.
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.580]   These are the false teachers you see.
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:12.540]   But they went out that they might be made manifest, that they were not all of us.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:20.500]   But, you have an action from the Holy One, and you know all things.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:25.540]   I have not written unto you because you know not the truth but because you know it and
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.060]   that no lie is of the truth.
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:34.700]   Then he goes on later on and says again, "But the anointing which ye have received of him
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.980]   abideth in you.
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:43.100]   And you need not that any man teach you, but the same anointing teaches you of all things
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:51.860]   and is truth and is no lie; and even as it hath taught you, you shall abide in him."
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:52.860]   Disciples.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:59.140]   They are not only given a hunger for it, they are given the power to receive it.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:05.460]   And more, they are given the power of discrimination so that when the clever men are misunderstanding
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:10.580]   the gospel, some poor ignoramus who has been born again can tell him that he is wrong and
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.620]   that it isn't the gospel.
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.620]   That's the detail.
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:20.900]   And it has been verified on countless numbers of occasions throughout the running centuries.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:21.900]   But let me hurry on.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:22.900]   What else?
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:29.540]   Well, the next thing that I read about these people is this, that they become men of character.
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:35.300]   "Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report."
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:39.020]   Oh, what a gospel this is.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:46.540]   Here is a gospel that can change a man, do away with enmities, make brethren of enemies.
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:51.180]   It can give them a desire for the truth, make them disciples.
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:58.780]   And now it reforms them, it makes them characters, men of honest report.
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:03.460]   When you consider what some of these have been, you see exactly what that represents.
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.340]   I mustn't stay with this.
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:10.900]   Let me put it to you in just one great statement made by the Apostle Paul to the church at
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:11.900]   Corinth.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:17.980]   This is how he puts it in 1 Corinthians 6, "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:26.940]   inherit the kingdom of God, be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:33.900]   nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:39.980]   drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:50.620]   And such were some of you, but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:58.100]   in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God."
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:04.340]   Here is a power that can take an utter moral weakling and make him strong and mighty.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:07.900]   It washes him, it cleanses him, it renews him.
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.740]   It gives him moral vigor and a moral fiber.
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.260]   It makes him a man of character.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.980]   What else does it do?
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:19.300]   Well we read that it's possible for a man to be filled with the Spirit.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.300]   What does that do?
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.340]   Well it gives men many gifts.
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:28.060]   I read here that we are told that they should choose men of honest regard, full of the Holy
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:33.220]   Ghost and wisdom.
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:36.420]   And the gift of wisdom is one of the gifts of the Holy Ghost.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:42.980]   Here is a great power that can give men abilities that they've never had.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:52.020]   Here is a baptism of power that can give a man wisdom, understanding, knowledge, faith.
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:58.580]   This means Stephen was full of faith, trusting God, able to rely upon God's word, venturing
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:59.580]   out on God.
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.420]   The gift of faith, one of the gifts of the Spirit.
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:09.980]   Wisdom, understanding, knowledge, faith, miracles, healings, talents, all these things are gifts
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:13.100]   of the Spirit.
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:18.140]   And this is what this wonderful gospel does to us you see.
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:23.280]   Did you notice this wonderful thing at the end of the chapter, all that sat in the council
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:33.540]   looking steadfastly on Stephen, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:38.140]   His enemies looking at him, the members of the council were his enemies.
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:43.500]   And here is Stephen standing before them untoiled, and all that sat in the council looking steadfastly
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:48.060]   on him saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:51.660]   There was a radiance, there was a shining, there was a glory.
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:52.660]   Is it Stephen?
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:57.020]   No, no, it's God shining through the face of Stephen.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:01.580]   It's a man who is filled with the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:06.220]   Now then my friends, that is what this gospel does.
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.140]   We needn't worry about these modern methods.
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:13.140]   We needn't reduce the gospel to the level of human understanding.
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:20.980]   It is the truth of God, and here is the power, the power of the Spirit, that's what it does.
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:27.500]   So I come to my last point, which I'm anxious to emphasize this evening.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:36.180]   And it is that you see the glory of the gospel in its invincibility.
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:43.500]   What a gospel, and oh the poor little modern men who are nervous about it, and trying to
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:51.100]   reduce it and to trim it to suit the palate of the modern pseudo-intellectuals, and others
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:55.300]   who are trying to make it cheap and acceptable and easy.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:58.540]   Oh, shame on them, shame on them.
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:42:59.540]   Have they missed the glory?
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.100]   Haven't they seen it ever?
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:09.860]   This wonderful gospel, the word and the Spirit, and it is invincible.
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:13.540]   Now look at this chapter.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:20.320]   This gospel has had to face opposition and difficulties from the very beginning.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.380]   It's all in this one chapter.
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:26.980]   Let's be honest, let's be frank, let's face the facts.
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:31.840]   It's a marvelous thing that there is a church left at all.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.840]   Why?
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.620]   Well, at the very beginning you see trouble and opposition arose even in the bosom of
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:37.620]   the church herself.
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:43.300]   In those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:46.580]   the Grecians against the Hebrews.
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:51.060]   My dear friend, if the church were a human institution, she'd have gone out of existence
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.060]   centuries ago.
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:57.460]   If men could have destroyed the church, they would most certainly have done so.
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:01.520]   Don't misunderstand me when I say that the gospel creates a man anew, I don't say it
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.760]   immediately makes him perfect, not at all.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:08.300]   Here were very imperfect Christians, and many of us are very imperfect Christians.
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:14.240]   We don't preach ourselves, we preach Christ Jesus the Lord and the power of the Spirit.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.160]   Difficulties within, and then difficulties without.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:22.720]   Then there arose certainly the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the Libertines,
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:29.020]   Syrians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen,
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:31.280]   trying to bring an end to it.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.080]   The church has had to fight for her life from the very beginning.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:41.720]   We've seen in the previous chapters how these apostles were arrested and thrown into prison,
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.640]   how they were threatened, how they were commended not to preach it any more.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:50.840]   The world did everything it could to silence it and to exterminate Christianity the moment
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:58.680]   it was born, and it's gone on like that throughout the running centuries.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:05.760]   And what has been the story, well it has been this, there have been eras and epochs when
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.840]   the church seemed to be defeated.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:13.360]   There have been times when it looked as if the world and the flesh and the devil were
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:18.960]   triumphant and the church was, oh, just a little remnant and very weak and feeble.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:25.160]   The world had conquered Christianity and the world has thought that many and many a time.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:30.560]   Sometimes it looks as if the end had come, but it never has come, and it never will come.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.520]   Here was a desperate situation.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:39.000]   Stephen was put to death, but it wasn't the end, it went on.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:47.640]   And it will continue until its plan and its purpose is brought to an ultimate triumph
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.720]   and to a final completion.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.440]   On what grounds do I say that?
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:59.080]   Well, they're all here in this chapter, let me just note them to you as I'm closing.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:04.680]   Why must this continue in triumph?
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.760]   It doesn't look like it at the present time, does it?
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:12.560]   Only ten percent of us claim to be Christians in this country.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.720]   It all seems to be on the other side.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.160]   People are laughing at it, they're ridiculing it.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:22.280]   They say it's monstrous to expect people to believe such things in the twentieth century.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:27.680]   And yet I stand here and say that this is a passing phase, that the gospel will go on
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:34.240]   and on and triumph and prevail and bring its great program to a perfect conclusion.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:38.200]   On what grounds do I base my optimism?
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:45.480]   The answer is because it is the Word and the truth of God.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.200]   Truth must triumph.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.200]   Evil cannot triumph.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:54.080]   If evil were to triumph, it would mean the defeat of God, and that's impossible.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.760]   God must prevail.
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:02.760]   And God is truth, God is right, God is righteousness, God is holy, God in his inscrutable will permits
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.720]   evil to triumph for a while, but only for a while.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:12.760]   The way he will triumph, it is God, and it's true, and it's truth, and it's everlasting.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:20.480]   It's the character of the message that guarantees its final success.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:27.360]   This is the truth of God, that this is God's world, not man's.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:32.800]   Man's inventions shouldn't turn our heads, man's only discovering what God's already
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:33.800]   put there.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:38.840]   And the more that they discover, the more they reveal the glory of God.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:45.000]   It's God's world, and God's character is involved in it.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.120]   And God has given us this message.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.120]   What is it?
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:53.360]   Well, it is that though man has fallen and brought chaos down upon himself and his world,
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.400]   that God is going to redeem it.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.280]   He's given the promise away back in Eden.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.840]   Here it is being worked out, and it's still being worked out.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:06.720]   But it's God, and God is so involved in this that he sent his only son into it.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:10.400]   He became man, the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:15.820]   He took our sins upon himself, he bore our sins in his own body on the tree.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:24.680]   He has done this, he's died to redeem us, and to redeem the world and the universe.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:30.920]   And God has pledged himself to this, it must triumph, it must prevail.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:36.520]   And there is the power of God in it, as I say, not only to forgive us, but to re-create
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:41.480]   us, to give us new life, to make us new men, to give us new natures, new understanding,
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:42.480]   new everything.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:51.840]   It is the truth of God, and it must triumph, God must triumph, because he is God.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:55.320]   But let me show it to you in another way.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:59.640]   Look at the feebleness of the opposition.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:03.120]   And I commend this to you.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.120]   I don't know what would happen to me if I wasn't a Christian, I couldn't believe what's
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:08.400]   being offered as an alternative.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.840]   Look at it here as it's depicted.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:15.480]   Here they are, they start disputing with Stephen, but I'm told they were not able to resist
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.360]   the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:23.000]   Then they summoned men which said, we have heard him speak blasphemous words against
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.520]   Moses and against God, an absolute lie.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:31.280]   And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes and came upon him and caught
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:37.560]   him and brought him to the council, and set up false witnesses which said, this man ceases
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:42.160]   not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law, for we have heard
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:47.480]   him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the customs
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.160]   which Moses delivered us.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.500]   You see what it all means.
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:56.120]   That's the opposition.
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:50:01.720]   You see its character, they don't do it in quite as blatant a form at the present time,
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:08.760]   but they come very near it, you know, the lying, the twisting, the dishonesty in the
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:14.360]   reasoning and in the reported facts, anything they can in order to make this ridiculous
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:19.800]   and playing to the gallery, getting popular applause, they'll stoop to anything.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:26.040]   But here they are, this is what we are told about them, they could not resist the wisdom
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:30.840]   and the spirit by which Stephen spake.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.440]   They really couldn't.
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.720]   And you know nobody can.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:39.560]   What is there that can be said against this gospel?
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.560]   What's wrong with it?
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:42.640]   What's your complaint against it?
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:48.120]   What's wrong with a gospel that offers us free pardon and forgiveness?
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:52.920]   What's wrong with a gospel that offers to make us anew?
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:57.400]   What's wrong with a gospel that calls upon us to keep the Ten Commandments and to live
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:58.640]   the Sermon on the Mount?
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.320]   What's wrong with it?
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:04.880]   My dear friends, if only the whole world were living according to this teaching, you wouldn't
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:09.200]   have any of your problems in the international realm, the world would be paradise again.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.360]   What can you say against it?
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:15.800]   They couldn't resist the spirit and the wisdom with which Stephen spake.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.400]   And there is no answer to this, none at all.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:25.120]   You can only resort to lies and inventions and the utter feebleness of the opposition.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.120]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:31.480]   A book has been published quite recently, a symposium with a title, the imposing title,
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:32.480]   What I Believe.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:36.880]   You know, I almost feel like ordering every one of you to buy it and to read it.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:37.880]   Why?
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.160]   Well, for this reason.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:44.960]   To start with, you'll find it very difficult in many of the cases to understand what they're
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.080]   saying at all.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:50.480]   But when you do understand what they're saying, you'll find that they're writing about what
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.000]   they don't believe, though the title of the book is What I Believe.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.860]   There's nothing there, it's all negation, they don't know.
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:03.440]   They say they see no meaning in the universe, there's no end to it, there's no object,
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:08.600]   it's all, well it's accident and chance, there's nothing in life at all for any of us.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.600]   What do I believe?
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:10.600]   I believe nothing.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:11.600]   I don't know.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:12.600]   That's what they're virtually saying.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.600]   Read it.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:20.640]   It's all the fable-ness of the opposition, they couldn't resist the spirit and the wisdom
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.360]   with which Stephen spake.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:27.820]   There is no answer to the wisdom of God that is in the message of this gospel.
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:32.800]   There's my second reason for my optimism and my confidence, but finally it is of course
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:39.840]   in this, that it is the power of God himself.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:46.560]   And that is more than sufficient, it's not only the truth of God, it is the power of
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:51.080]   God unto salvation to everyone that believeth.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:55.480]   The power that created the universe out of nothing, the power that brought the Lord Jesus
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:58.640]   Christ up from among the dead, what a power.
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:04.360]   It's a resurrecting power, it's an invincible power.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:08.480]   It is indeed the power of God.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:15.280]   They could not only not resist the wisdom of what Stephen said, they couldn't resist
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:19.120]   the spirit with which he said it.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:25.560]   And any man who is resisting this and trying to object to this gospel and refusing it,
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:29.200]   he's doing nothing but resisting the almighty God.
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:35.920]   He's hurling himself against the everlasting God, and he'll only dash himself to pieces.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:41.320]   He'll end in ultimate destruction, which is everlasting destruction.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:45.720]   His kingdom cannot fail.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:54.480]   He rules on earth and heaven, the keys of, he rules on earth and heaven, the keys of
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:58.320]   death and hell are to our Jesus given.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:09.680]   Lift up your hearts, lift up your voice, again rejoice, again I say, rejoice.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.760]   Let them rise up against him, here they did at the beginning, they've done it throughout
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:14.760]   the running centuries.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:21.080]   The Jews were opposed, the Romans rose up afterwards, the Goths and the Vandals came,
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:27.000]   all the hordes of evil and of hell have been let loose against this Christ, this gospel,
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   this message.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:35.280]   They've all done their utmost, but the gates of hell shall not prevail against this.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:43.120]   This is the power of God unto salvation, to every one that believeth.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:50.040]   Jesus Christ and him crucified is the power of God and is the wisdom of God.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.560]   Can't you see it?
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:52.560]   Have you ever felt it?
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.120]   I want to put some personal questions to you.
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:55:00.160]   Have you ever felt the power of this spirit dealing with you?
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:05.880]   There was the spirit in Stephen dealing with these people and they couldn't resist the
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:10.720]   wisdom and the spirit, that means this, that they had no reply to make, but they went on
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:11.720]   resisting.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:16.800]   There was no answer, they were speechless, and yet they said we won't.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.880]   Have you been doing that, my friend?
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:23.120]   Have you felt the power of this word, have you seen the wisdom of it, have you seen the
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:27.300]   glory of it, have you seen the perfection of it, have you seen God in it, have you felt
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:33.200]   the spirit, the power, dealing with you, showing you your emptiness and woe, showing your need
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:39.180]   of salvation, displaying to you the glory of the Son of God, dying on a cross that you
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:44.720]   might be forgiven, offering you new life, new vigor, new understanding, offering to
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.440]   make you a child of God.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:51.760]   Have you felt it?
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:56:00.840]   Are you still resisting, still resisting the Holy Spirit of God?
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:07.680]   I warn you that you're pitting yourself against all mightiness, and you and the clever men
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:11.720]   of the modern era will go down to destruction.
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:20.040]   You're hurling yourself against the rock of ages, against the immovable God.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:30.960]   My dear friend, recognize the wisdom, yield to the Spirit, the Spirit of God.
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:33.600]   Is he not pleading with you?
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:38.840]   Is he not saying within you, admit it, confess it, yield to it?
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.920]   You know you're a failure.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:45.520]   You put up your intellectual camouflage, you know it's only a pretense.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:51.680]   You know the running sore of your soul, be honest, admit it, confess it, give in, yield
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:57.120]   yourself to it, believe the gospel, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:58.120]   saved.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:03.480]   Hearken to the pleadings of the Son of God who died that you might be forgiven.
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:11.920]   Listen to him as he pleads with you, that you may be saved from everlasting destruction.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:17.240]   Oh, the wisdom of the gospel, have you seen it?
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:23.120]   Oh, the Spirit and the power of the gospel, have you felt it?
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:26.840]   Come, my friend, have you given obedience to this?
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.960]   Have you yielded yourself to it?
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.280]   Are you aware that you've been made anew?
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:34.560]   Have you become a disciple?
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.740]   Do you want to know more and more about this?
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:39.600]   Have you become one of the brethren?
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:45.120]   Do you feel that you're made anew in such a sense that these are your people, the people
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:50.640]   of God, that you belong to the family of God and you look forward with them to the everlasting
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:51.640]   glory?
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:58.360]   Shall I ask you a final question?
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:05.040]   Do people sometimes express their amazement to you as they look at you?
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:09.080]   Do they look at you at times and say that they see your face as if it had been the face
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:12.720]   of an angel?
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:17.280]   Are you such that people come to you and say, "What's the secret of your life?
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:21.200]   What's the peace and the quiet and the equanimity that I see in you?
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:23.040]   How can I get that?
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:26.920]   What is this, the face of an angel?"
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:32.920]   My dear friends, here is the offer of the gospel, free forgiveness, whatever you may
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.440]   have been, whatever you may have done.
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:42.120]   You can be born again, you can have new life, new nature, new understanding.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:47.840]   You can be filled with the Spirit of God.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:57.840]   Become a child of God, an heir of God, and a joint heir with Christ, of the everlasting
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:01.240]   glory which is yet to come.
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:10.000]   All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of men as the flower of grass.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:21.320]   The grass withereth and fadeth away, but the word of the Lord endureth forever.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:32.140]   And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:39.520]   The twentieth century and all its glory will pass away, as every other glory in civilization
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:47.720]   has already passed away, but the word of the Lord endureth forever.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:50.920]   It has been preached to you.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:52.560]   Have you obeyed it?
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:55.000]   Have you believed it?
[00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:04.760]   Have you yielded yourself to it and the glory of its power?
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.760]   Amen.
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.680]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
