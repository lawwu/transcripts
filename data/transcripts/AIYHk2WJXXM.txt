[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   - We broke the entire landscape of tools
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.420]   that you can use to get maximum value out of your points.
[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.740]   How did you decide to break it up?
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.500]   - So first we have flight search tools.
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.060]   So press go and tell me what flights are available,
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.540]   how much they cost with points.
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.100]   Another category is flight discovery,
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.460]   and that's where the tools are broader.
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.820]   Then the next two categories are around hotel searches.
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.300]   So you have hotel points and you wanna use them.
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.780]   The other category...
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.540]   - What's been the impact for the ability for you
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.580]   to get maximum value out of your points
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.100]   by having access to all these tools?
[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.080]   - It's huge because...
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.620]   - Greg, thanks for being here.
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.020]   - Thanks for having me on.
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.980]   - We actually recorded this episode once
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.460]   and then so much changed
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.600]   in the points and miles searching tools
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.420]   that we said, let's do it again.
[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.820]   And I'm glad we did.
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.900]   And we have a little bit more structure this time.
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.740]   - We do.
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.900]   This time we have a nice outline,
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.900]   but also we just had so much fun recording before,
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.260]   figured why not do it again, right?
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.340]   - I know, usually it's audio problems, video problems,
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.180]   and you're like, oh, we lost it, we gotta record here.
[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.660]   It's like, nope, it all worked.
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.120]   We just wanted to do a better job for everyone listening
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.040]   and hopefully you will all appreciate it.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.300]   So what we did was we broke the entire landscape of tools
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.380]   that you can use to search for flights
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.760]   and hotels into a couple categories.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.820]   And I added one, but you kind of started this list.
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.620]   So how did you decide to break it up?
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.980]   - Yeah, so first we have flight search tools.
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.300]   So you have all these points,
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.420]   you wanna book a flight to somewhere.
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.780]   How do you find a good award flights?
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.380]   There are two broad categories of tools
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.400]   that I think are important to think of differently.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.780]   One is just flight search,
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.900]   which means you know you wanna go from this airport
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.940]   to that airport, you know your dates of travel,
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.300]   press go and tell me what flights are available,
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.140]   how much they cost with points,
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.100]   which points I should use to book it.
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.120]   That's a basic flight search tool.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.300]   Another category is flight discovery.
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.720]   And that's where the tools are broader.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.940]   They're not designed to tell you
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.860]   which exact flights to get from here to there,
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.300]   but rather to say, you know,
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.100]   I wanna fly to Europe sometime this summer,
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.660]   or, you know, you have a broad idea of what you wanna do.
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.940]   These discovery tools help you find
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.420]   what are all the best opportunities
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.900]   for that sort of broad idea.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.660]   'Cause maybe you wanna go to Europe,
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.840]   but you don't really care about where,
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.740]   you just want the best flights to get there
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.020]   and at the best times where the best flights are available.
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.140]   So that's what flight discovery tools can help you do.
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.820]   - It could also be, I just wanna fly on a business class
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.140]   or first-class cabin for a great deal.
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.620]   And like, if my vacation takes me to Asia
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.380]   or Europe or South America, so be it.
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.900]   I'll go anywhere, but give me one of those
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.720]   once-in-a-lifetime redemption for a low value.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.860]   - Absolutely, yep.
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.340]   Then the next two categories are around hotel searches.
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.260]   So you have hotel points and you wanna use them.
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.960]   The most obvious use I'm calling hotel trip planning.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.220]   And that's where basically,
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.280]   you know you're gonna be going to Paris
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   during July 6th to the 20th,
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.000]   and show me what hotels are available in Paris at that time
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.500]   and how much do they cost with points?
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.980]   That's what I'm calling hotel trip planning.
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.780]   The other category I'm calling
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.120]   impossible to find hotel awards.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.780]   So this is where you have your heart set
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.780]   on a particular hotel, but it's a popular hotel.
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.080]   It's rarely available with points.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.040]   Tools like this will help you find when it is available.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.040]   And so that's why it's impossible
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.560]   to find hotels awards searches.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.180]   - The only one I added was I added a category
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.080]   that we'll get to in flights,
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.480]   which is just some other flight tools.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.060]   There's a handful of things that don't necessarily fit
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.600]   into search and discovery,
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.420]   but I think are worth kind of just quickly running through
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.260]   so people know they exist.
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.660]   And so I'll add a few of my favorites there.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.220]   I know you've used a couple of them also.
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.260]   - Yep, yep.
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.060]   That'll be good.
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.500]   So that'll be the last category
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.300]   is the miscellaneous other flight search tools.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.260]   But I think you had some things
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.940]   that weren't really even flight searches, right?
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.460]   So it's just miscellaneous other tools, let's say.
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.980]   - For anyone who has miles,
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.360]   we're gonna do an episode actually with your co-host
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.700]   on the Frequent Miler in the Air podcast, Nick,
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.140]   talking about just general how to search for awards,
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.260]   not the tactical,
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.580]   but how to just think about redeeming your points
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.720]   and how to get the most value out of your points
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.100]   and ways to structure that and think about it
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.580]   and how far out to plan.
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.320]   That episode, we're actually gonna record
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.320]   at the end of this week.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.420]   It'll be out a few weeks after,
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.740]   but I wanted this one to come out first
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.980]   because the last thing I wanna tell everyone is,
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.700]   hey, here's how to start thinking about it,
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.820]   but not actually give you the tools to use.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.020]   So we're gonna talk about the tools.
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.580]   And then for anyone who wants to zoom out a little
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.700]   and think, how do I even just start thinking
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.100]   about the best ways to redeem my points,
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.860]   when to look, where to look, how to structure the trip,
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.020]   that'll be coming in a few weeks with Nick.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.220]   And that one will certainly make reference
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.640]   back to this episode.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.720]   - Yeah, great point.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.900]   Before we dive into flight search tools,
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.620]   I just wanna give some broad background
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.340]   because I think a lot of people think,
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.580]   well, I've got my American Airlines miles.
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.220]   So obviously the way to search for awards
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.940]   is to just get on aa.com and type in where I wanna go
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.700]   and see what comes up.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.140]   And there's a couple of problems with that.
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.140]   One is that you might miss some great opportunities
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.380]   to use your American Airlines miles
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.540]   because you didn't look at other dates
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.740]   or you didn't look at other cities.
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.940]   So for example, you might be wanting to fly
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.980]   somewhere far away to South Africa, let's say,
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.040]   and maybe you started your search in San Francisco,
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:32.220]   but the best flight awards might be available from LA.
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.940]   And so you might be able to book that first leg separately
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.300]   to get to LA and then get that great award flight.
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.420]   And you wouldn't have seen that
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.540]   if you just get on aa.com and do that simple search.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.900]   The other thing that I think a lot of people don't realize
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.740]   is that you probably have access
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.240]   to a lot of other airline miles than what you know about.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.380]   So you might know you have American Airlines miles,
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.740]   but what you might not know
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.020]   is that your Chase Ultimate Rewards points
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.740]   transfer to a bunch of different airline programs
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.340]   or your American Express Membership Rewards points
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.740]   can transfer to a number of different programs.
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.020]   And I think a big part of what we're gonna be talking about
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.300]   is how these flight search tools
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.740]   will tell you not just what award flights are available,
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.580]   but what program you can get those points from.
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.180]   So you could transfer your Chase points
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.340]   over to Virgin Atlantic, let's say,
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.860]   in order to book an Air France flight.
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.820]   And so that kind of complexity
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.900]   is something that a lot of people I think are afraid of,
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.900]   but these tools make it pretty easy to grasp, I think.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.460]   - And I don't know if this is still
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.220]   as much the case as it used to be,
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.400]   but in the past, at least,
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.040]   I remember there are some airlines
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.940]   that you might be able to use your United, Delta, Amac,
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.640]   or Air France, whatever points on,
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.020]   with their partners that don't show up on their website.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.540]   And so I don't know how much that's still true,
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.080]   but there were some partners
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.980]   that you could use points in one program to book,
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.460]   but you had to know that the availability was there
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.700]   from another tool to be able to book it.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:14.580]   It's still there.
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.180]   It's not as bad as it used to be.
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.980]   It used to be very, very common.
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.320]   But I think a lot of tools have gotten better about that.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.460]   And the search tools we're gonna talk about
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.460]   won't necessarily help you with that specific situation.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.460]   So for example, let's say your United Miles
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.740]   could be used for a particular United partner
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.060]   that's not available through United's website.
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:45.220]   You might, one of these tools might show
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.760]   that that award flight is available with some other points,
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.780]   but it's not gonna show that it's available with United.
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.540]   You have to be smart enough to know,
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.420]   oh, United's a partner with that airline,
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.940]   so I could use my United Miles.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.380]   And so that's a problem that is not solved
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.380]   by the tools we're gonna talk about.
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.220]   - Okay.
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.260]   All right.
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.260]   All right, so let's dive in.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.420]   Flight search tools.
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.580]   These are the tools that look like Google Flights
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.820]   or Kayak Flights or Expedia
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.620]   when you're searching for flights.
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.140]   They ask you for where you're going from,
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.440]   where you're going to, number of passengers,
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.540]   what are your dates that you're traveling,
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.160]   and what class of service do you want,
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.380]   economy, business class, first class.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.220]   So there's a whole slew of tools like this.
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.100]   And in my opinion, the ones that are best
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.540]   do a number of things.
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.440]   First of all, they search a number
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.580]   of different airline programs.
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.980]   If you just search Delta United American,
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.300]   you're gonna miss out on a lot of opportunities
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.940]   for really good priced award flights.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:53.380]   The best tools run quickly, run their searches quickly,
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.880]   and they can search a range of dates at once.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.680]   Now, this is something that you don't normally see
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.880]   on a Kayak-like tool, the ability to say,
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.640]   I wanna leave any day this week, or that kind of thing.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.280]   But it's more important with award flights,
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.560]   because sometimes if you just look at one day,
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.800]   you might see that the best award flight would cost,
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.100]   I'll make up a number, like 400,000 points for one person.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.640]   But if you look at a range of days,
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.560]   maybe a couple of days later,
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.040]   there's a flight for 50,000 points.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.880]   And it can easily be that dramatic of a difference.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:39.000]   And so, it's very, very helpful to have a program
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.220]   that can search a range of dates like that.
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:45.400]   Another thing that's important
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.140]   is to be able to search multiple airports at once.
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.200]   This is something not a lot of tools can do,
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.440]   but there's a few that can.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.440]   And the idea there is a couple of things.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.080]   Maybe you're near multiple airports,
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.000]   and so you wanna specify,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.200]   I'm willing to leave from any of these
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.720]   two or three airports.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.040]   But also, where you're flying to,
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.560]   you can often find better deals
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.800]   by flying to different airports.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   And you might have to then book another short-distance flight
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.880]  , let's say, to get to where you really
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.240]   wanna end up ultimately.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.080]   But the more you do searches,
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.840]   the more you're gonna want that capability
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.120]   to put in multiple airports.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.020]   - And just on that note, my wife and I were going to Japan.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.200]   We really wanted to do it in business.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.120]   From Portland, the flights were in business
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.520]   were like one quarter of the cost
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.280]   on the kind of range of dates we wanted
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.080]   as they were from San Francisco.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.480]   It was like 100,000-something round trip
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.960]   from Portland and like 400,000 round trip in San Francisco.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.400]   And the flight to Portland was like $100 each way.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.240]   - Yeah.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.360]   - So like $200 plus 100,000 points
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.280]   is infinitely better than spending 100,000 points.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.680]   And at the time we had no kids,
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.120]   so the extra stop was not nearly as much work
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.320]   as it would be with kids.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.880]   So I just wanna really highlight how valuable it can be
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.480]   to be able to search a range of airports
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.320]   that are not necessarily a short drive,
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.760]   but might be a short flight.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.380]   - Yeah, great point.
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:29.520]   Terminology wise, we call those positioning flights
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.360]   when you fly to somewhere like Portland
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.360]   in order to get the flight you ultimately want.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.040]   And that can happen at both ends of your trip, right?
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.160]   Like so maybe you wanted to go to Kyoto,
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.760]   but the best deals were to fly to Tokyo.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.000]   So you fly to Tokyo
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.840]   and then you take either a positioning flight
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.880]   from Tokyo to Kyoto, or you take a train.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.200]   You know, you have other,
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.800]   you have different options for positioning,
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.320]   but that's the idea here.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.800]   One of the biggest features,
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.040]   or most important features I think,
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.140]   is the ability to set alerts.
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.720]   So what some people might not realize
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.840]   is if you sit down and do an award search
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.240]   to see what's available,
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.600]   that's not the end of the story.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.000]   Like you may find some good flights, you may not,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.960]   but what's available changes all the time.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.640]   So if you don't find what you like,
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.200]   I find it's like critical to be able to set up an alert
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.800]   so that the tool will keep checking
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.040]   the route you're interested in,
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.320]   and will email you when something
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.920]   within your parameters becomes available.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.000]   And then you get the email and then you can jump online
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.720]   and hopefully book that trip.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.880]   So that's setting alerts.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.760]   And finally, some good tools provide detailed instructions.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.880]   So for beginners who don't know
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.360]   that you can transfer chase points, Virgin Atlantic,
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.520]   like I was talking about before,
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.160]   some tools will actually kind of step you through,
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.040]   here's how to do it, and here's exactly what to do.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.440]   Not just to transfer the points,
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.600]   but then to actually book it
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.520]   once you have the points in the right place.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.320]   So those are the criteria I looked at.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.560]   And I looked at a number of tools
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.040]   and I'll just list them really quick.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:29.040]   AwardLogic, AwardTool, PointMe, PointsPath, PointsYeah,
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.360]   and Roam.travel.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.040]   Those are the tools I looked at.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:33.880]   - Those might've been the ones
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.240]   you gave a full comparison to,
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.440]   but I know we also even talked about looking at PointHound.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.760]   We talked about playing around
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.040]   with Oasis new flight search.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.000]   So I would say maybe this is the short list,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.480]   but I know you've probably played
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.120]   with half a dozen more tools
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.280]   that we're not even putting on the short list
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.160]   that we will then take down to like a final set.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.120]   So I'll just flag that every week,
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.840]   it seems like there's a new tool
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.960]   or a new feature from a tool.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.160]   And so there's a handful of other tools
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.120]   that I know you've played with in the past or recently
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.200]   that maybe didn't even make it to this short list,
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.160]   but I wanna make sure everyone listening knows
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.760]   that we've probably looked at most of them.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.200]   Reward Flight Finder, I think was another one.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.840]   So there's so many of them.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.640]   - There are, there are so many,
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.480]   and you're absolutely right.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.080]   Some of the ones that made the list made them
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.320]   because they're very popular tools.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.640]   And so I felt like I needed to cover them.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.560]   And then some of them made the list
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.000]   because they have a lot of the capabilities
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.400]   that I'm looking for that I just described.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.320]   And some of the ones that didn't make the list
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.040]   are ones that are new or new to me.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.440]   And I looked at them briefly,
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.840]   saw, oh, they don't let me do a range of dates.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.320]   They don't let me set alerts, you know?
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:57.320]   So there wasn't anything that I could see right at a glance
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.680]   that they weren't gonna make the top of my list.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.040]   So there's no reason to do an in-depth comparison with those.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.000]   - That makes sense.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.480]   - Cutting it down right to the end point here,
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.440]   so which tools are best for given all those things
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.440]   I talked about?
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:17.320]   And the truth is, as things stand right now,
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.920]   there are two tools that check most of the boxes,
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.640]   Pointia and AwardTool.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.960]   They are very similar to each other.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:32.360]   They both have almost all of those things I mentioned.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:37.160]   They have alerts, they allow you to do a range of dates,
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:42.160]   they let you do multiple airports, and they're fast.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.600]   So those are cool things about both of those tools.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.520]   And they both have capable free versions.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.680]   So as long as you sign up, even for the free version,
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.920]   you can do meaningful searches, you can do a range of dates,
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.600]   not as many dates as you would be able to do
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.760]   if you got the pro version, but still,
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.080]   and you can set some alerts.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.680]   So there's a lot there,
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.640]   whether you pay for these tools or not.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.920]   And they're similar priced, as things stand now,
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.120]   they're around $90 a year.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.960]   And AwardTool has a $12 per month option
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.520]   if you wanna pay for the tools.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.880]   - So I'm pulling up Pointia,
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.480]   just for anyone that's on video with us.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.160]   And just to kind of walk people through high level,
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.720]   you can go in and you can say,
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.200]   I'm departing from San Francisco or Los Angeles.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.320]   It looks like on Pointia, you can pick two airports.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.240]   - That's right.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.080]   - Right now, and you can say I'm going to,
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.320]   let's say Paris or London.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.720]   So they've got two, but only two.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.120]   So that might be a little bit of a change.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.320]   And then for dates, I can say,
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.840]   let's go from April 1st to April 8th.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.080]   I can choose a week window for this one-way flight.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.600]   And I can say economy and premium economy,
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.080]   or business at first, which is nice.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.640]   You don't have to search business separately from first.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.160]   And you could actually filter the programs,
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.120]   but I hope that people listening have,
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.000]   you know, tried to build up a points balance
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.600]   in enough places that don't start your search
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.920]   by filtering by the airline.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.800]   Do that later, once you get somewhere.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.040]   And obviously choose the number of passengers
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   you're looking for.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.280]   And so you'll get a list of all of those flights
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.080]   and the airlines they come from.
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.920]   - The main difference, if I remember right,
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.000]   I'm looking, now I'm pulling up a word tool
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.200]   to do a similar thing.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.760]   I can search 16 airports.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.680]   Lot more than two.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.760]   - You can, but then, so award flights,
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.360]   award tool, sorry, award tool,
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.320]   which you're looking at now.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.800]   It, yeah, it'll let you do up to 16 airports,
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.120]   but if you do 16 airports,
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.200]   then you can only do a single day.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:05.560]   - Yeah, they're basically letting you search 16 vectors,
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:06.400]   I guess.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.680]   It's like two airports for eight days,
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.400]   four airports for four days.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.400]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.440]   And then they have this mega version of their search,
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.800]   which I have no idea why it's separate,
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.120]   but that gives you 24 degrees of freedom.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.920]   So you could do 24 airports,
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.480]   or you could do one airport in a 24-day date range,
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:35.480]   or you could do two, from airports to two airports
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.320]   in a 12-day date range.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.200]   - Now I do know some of these, just to be clear.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.520]   I think to dial it up to 16 or use mega,
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.040]   you need to be a premium member.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.120]   - Yes.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.280]   - Here's how I'll stack rank it.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.880]   I'll put a link to all the deals I've gotten for everyone.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.440]   If I don't have one, I'll put all the links
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.800]   that you guys have gotten to everyone,
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.640]   and if I don't have one of those,
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.760]   I'll just link to the website.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.320]   But I know that between you and I,
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.080]   we probably have some type of promo
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.640]   or referral or something for all these tools.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.680]   And it's really nice to be able to search
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.840]   a handful of different airlines or airports.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.680]   - Yeah.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.320]   - For me, it's like having three or four
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.760]   is sometimes a little better
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.680]   because we just have three in the Bay Area.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.120]   So if I can only get two, I can't even add LAX
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.840]   or something that's really close.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.320]   - So I like that.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.640]   - Yeah, I like that too.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.840]   For me from Detroit, if I'm flying, let's say to Europe,
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.160]   I look at all the major airports
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.120]   that I can easily get to in one short hop.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.960]   And so that includes New York City Airport,
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.960]   Chicago, Toronto, Washington, DC.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.600]   That's my short list of,
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.200]   and sometimes I'll throw in Boston,
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.400]   but my short list of airports,
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.280]   in addition to Detroit itself,
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.880]   that I'll put in my from list using a word tool.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.280]   And yeah, with points here,
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.400]   I can only put in two at a time,
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.380]   which is still better than once I only allow one.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.540]   - I was gonna put this in the grab bag list of tools,
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.600]   but for this particular use case,
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.680]   the tool I use the most is called Flight Connections.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.880]   I've heard, I can't remember,
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.880]   there's another tool that has a name that I can't remember,
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.240]   but the thing I love about Flight Connections
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.800]   is I can go in and put, oh, I live in San Francisco,
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.400]   and it'll just show me all the direct flights.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.760]   And so, if I'm starting off thinking
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.440]   I'd love to go to Europe, my usual choice,
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.360]   this is how I think about it.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.420]   I'm like, if I wanna go to Paris,
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.900]   obviously the perfect flight is SFO to Paris direct.
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.320]   But the game with points and miles
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.520]   is give yourself flexibility on dates,
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.040]   on departure airports.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.500]   So what I'll typically try to do is say,
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.680]   well, I wanna start an SFO and I wanna go to,
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.640]   I wanna look at all the airports in Europe,
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.800]   and then I'll reverse that search and say,
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.800]   or I'll look at Paris and look at all the places
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.280]   you can get to Paris from the United States.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.340]   Now, just looking at this map right now,
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.000]   I'm like, well, now I'm well over the 60,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.660]   I might not even be able to do a mega search here.
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.320]   I might have to do two searches,
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.240]   one from all of the US to Paris
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.840]   and one from all of Europe to San Francisco.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.980]   And we'll get to that when we talk about discovery,
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.200]   'cause I feel like we're kind of slowly
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.840]   crossing the line into discovery tools.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.960]   But I think Flight Connections is the best tool I've found
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.520]   for finding which airlines fly direct from an airport.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.760]   Yeah, no, I use it all the time for that purpose.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.720]   So for example, when I had a flight
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.920]   from Queenstown, New Zealand, I wanted to return home.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.320]   And Queenstown is a pretty small airport,
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.480]   and so I used Flight Connections to see,
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.480]   okay, there are nonstop flights from Queenstown to,
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.180]   and don't check my memory here,
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:02.760]   but to within New Zealand, Christchurch and Auckland,
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.200]   but also to some places in Australia like Sydney.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   And ultimately, I ended up getting a flight back from Sydney
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.880]   and so I separately positioned,
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.240]   booked a positioning flight from Queenstown
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.160]   to Sydney for that.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.000]   - Yep.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.440]   - I see it right now.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.280]   - Okay.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.480]   - Yeah, so. - There you go.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.200]   - Hopefully that's helpful.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.600]   You know, you could be playing along.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.480]   I should mention, all these websites,
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.900]   we're gonna put links to the show notes,
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.840]   you could play along at home and kind of play
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.320]   with these tools as we're talking about them.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.720]   For many of them, for award tool endpoints,
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.040]   yeah, which were your kind of top two,
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.680]   the free tool gives you some access.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.140]   Is there a general thought about what paying gives you?
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.120]   - So in both cases, you get a lot more flexibility
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:54.320]   with how many airports or dates you can search.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.720]   So for points, yeah, for example,
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:00.200]   you can only do one airport if you have the free version.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.120]   And I think you could do four day date range
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.240]   on the free version there.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:07.320]   And award tool gives you like four degrees of freedom
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.720]   that you could spend any way you want
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.440]   with four airports or four dates kind of thing.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.280]   - Okay.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.440]   - So that just goes way up when you pay for it.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.760]   Now award tool, that mega search thing,
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.960]   even a free version will give you a few,
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.140]   I can't remember the number,
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.640]   but it'll give you a few times you can use that mega search,
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.080]   the full power of it from,
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.760]   I can't remember a few a day or a few a month or whatever,
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.180]   but yeah, I think it's a few a day.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.820]   So that's pretty good right there.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.680]   - What would any of these other tools,
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.000]   when would they come into play?
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   - Two things that these tools don't do is they don't search,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.040]   they're not the best at searching
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.620]   all possible award programs.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.540]   And they don't provide detailed instructions for a beginner
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:01.540]   to show you how to move the points from Chase or Amex
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:05.320]   or Citi or Capital One to an airline program
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.000]   and then how to book it.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.800]   That kind of detail is something that you'll find
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.000]   in a tool called Point Me.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.040]   And Point Me also probably searches
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:21.040]   the most different programs of any of the tools here.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.480]   So Point Me--
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.080]   - Are there any major holes?
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.080]   Are there any like big obvious gotchas
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.520]   that Points Yeah or Award Tool aren't doing?
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.120]   - Probably the biggest is Singapore.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.520]   So if, and this is very specific,
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.440]   but if your heart's set on flying Singapore suites,
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.920]   which is amazing, first class,
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:54.480]   fully enclosed type of experience,
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:00.000]   the only way to book that is with Singapore's own miles.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.580]   And you can transfer to Singapore miles
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.800]   from pretty much any transferable points program.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.640]   So it's easy to get the miles,
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.640]   but among the popular tools, only Point Me,
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.440]   if I'm remembering right, actually searches Singapore.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.040]   So if you're using these other tools
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.680]   and you wanna fly Singapore,
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.900]   you either need to use Point Me
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.440]   or log into Singapore's website itself
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.400]   and do your searches there, which is how I do it.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.240]   - Yeah.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.920]   And I'm just, I just remembered one thing.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.120]   So I'm sharing my screen a little bit here
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.080]   and I was looking at Points Yeah,
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.400]   and I think the same thing is true on Award Tool.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.960]   One important thing,
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.240]   they all have the same kind of filtering tools.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.800]   So you can sort them, you can search by airports,
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.400]   arrival airports, how many stops are you taking?
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.120]   What's the max number of points or taxes?
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.560]   One thing that I think is important
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.600]   that a lot of people might forget
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.460]   is this premium cabin thing.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.680]   I got this flight and I said,
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.080]   "Wow, I wanna go from LAX to Paris.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.760]   It's only 32,000 points in business class.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.040]   That's incredible."
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:03.940]   And then I look and I said,
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.400]   "No, it's 21% in business class.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.840]   It's LAX to London in economy
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.840]   and then Heathrow to Frankfurt in business
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.680]   and then Frankfurt to Paris in business."
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.520]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.960]   - So like, first off,
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.940]   if you're trying to get from London to Paris,
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.280]   taking a one-stop flight through Frankfurt
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.440]   is probably one of the least efficient ways
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.300]   that you could get there.
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.880]   But two, I would advise you to set that marker
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.800]   to be somewhere at least over 80% or close.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.680]   Otherwise, you'll be stuck in a place
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.520]   where you're gonna end up finding awards
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.540]   that aren't really what you want.
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:44.200]   And then the other bummer one is that taxes.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.760]   So I'm looking on this search and it's like,
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.480]   "Well, now I found San Francisco to London
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.320]   for 38,000 points in business.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.320]   That's great."
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.720]   But it's on Virgin Atlantic
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.400]   and you can see the fees are $1,000, $998.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:04.400]   And so not to say that 38,000 points and $1,000
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.860]   isn't a better deal than paying for that ticket outright.
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.520]   It probably actually is,
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:14.700]   but I wouldn't say it's a screaming deal.
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.400]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely right.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.080]   And another parameter that I like to set often
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:25.460]   is the time of day, like departure time, arrival time,
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.040]   depending on what's going on.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.400]   If I don't wanna get up at three in the morning
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.720]   to catch a flight,
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.520]   I might set the minimum time to a later time.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.120]   And especially if I'm doing something
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.480]   where I have to catch another flight
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.320]   or get to somewhere in time, I use that a lot.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.720]   So those can be really helpful as well.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.080]   - Yeah, and then as just a little example here,
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.300]   I'm looking at points here and it says,
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.360]   "Oh, you can use these points on life miles."
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.960]   And I'm like, "That sounds great. Let's do it."
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.720]   Nice, a lot of these tools all show you,
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.320]   here's how many points it's gonna take
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.720]   to get your 61,200 life miles.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.280]   And most of them are looking
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.840]   at the current transfer bonuses.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.240]   Right now, Citi has a 25% transfer bonus.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:16.520]   So they say, "If you have Citi points, that's the deal."
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.480]   It looks like they do have a transfer guide here,
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.600]   but it's certainly not for everything.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.640]   And so they have a Citi transfer guide
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.840]   that's a little bit generic.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.060]   Otherwise, if they don't have one for an airline,
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.200]   it just takes you to the website.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   When I go to point.me and I say, "Show me how to do this."
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.000]   I guess here's the downside.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.200]   I have to wait for point.me to finish loading.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.020]   - That's the thing.
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.480]   We didn't talk about the downsides to point.me.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.560]   It is painfully slow.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.840]   It takes about two minutes, which may not sound bad
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.240]   if you just hear the word two minutes,
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.040]   but when you're running searches,
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.840]   and especially if you wanna do a bunch of different ones,
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.560]   I find it excruciating.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.040]   And it's made worse by the fact
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.160]   that point.me doesn't do date ranges.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.600]   So if you wanna check multiple days,
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.000]   you gotta run separate searches.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   It only does individual airports.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.040]   Again, you wanna check multiple airports,
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.520]   that's more searches, and it won't do alerts.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.760]   So a lot of downsides to point.me,
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:21.520]   but the fact that it gives such detailed instructions
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.580]   for how to transfer the points,
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.520]   how to book the flight once you have the points
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.120]   is really important for beginners.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:33.120]   And it totally could be worth someone buying a day pass
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:38.840]   to just use point.me to step them through that process.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.960]   - Totally.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.440]   - Even after they've,
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.600]   if they found an award through some other tool,
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.720]   you might wanna jump over to point.me
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.600]   to hold your hand through actually booking it.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.440]   - Yeah, I'm looking right now.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.600]   It's like, how do I book this flight on Virgin Atlantic?
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.800]   And this is a multi-step process
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.840]   of here's how to create the account.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.240]   Here's how to create the account on Virgin.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.260]   Here's how to create the account.
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.140]   Here's how to search.
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.160]   Here's how to walk you through one by one by one
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.880]   for each individual transferable currency,
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.000]   how to transfer it.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.360]   So I would definitely say,
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.140]   the way I use point.me is,
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.600]   if I'm trying to walk someone through it,
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.840]   I say, I found you a flight on these dates,
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.960]   go get a day pass to point.me so you can see how it works
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.860]   and then it'll walk you through it.
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.440]   Sometimes I use it as a validator.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.460]   Not to say I don't trust the other tools,
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.800]   but we didn't talk much about accuracy,
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.000]   but I think that's important.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.960]   And I feel like point.me,
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.860]   I've had the least number of issues
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.120]   where it shows me something that's not there.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.960]   And then sometimes it's that like,
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.320]   I'm about to book this flight in cash.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.160]   I only have one flight I want.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.320]   It's on these days.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.800]   It's on these times.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.740]   I'm not planning on using points,
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.640]   but let's do one search where the dates aren't flexible,
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.720]   the airports aren't flexible,
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.760]   just to see if miles and points are a better deal.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.160]   And that's where I think point.me can also do really great
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.120]   is if you have no flexibility and you just wanna see,
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.480]   is there a great way to do this with points?
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.440]   I think it's good.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.320]   Any other things?
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.400]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that's a really good point about it.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:20.400]   Although I had found a Life Miles flight
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:24.160]   a couple of weeks ago through a word tool
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.360]   and I didn't see it on points yet.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.400]   So I checked point.me and it wasn't there either.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.940]   So I thought, oh, it's Phantom Space,
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.120]   but then I was able to bring it up and book it on Life Miles.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:39.160]   So there's no tool that's perfect.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:44.160]   And I don't know why even with these tools,
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.320]   sometimes you could run the same exact search
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.400]   multiple times and you'll see a flight
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.120]   like the Life Miles one show up,
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.280]   but then not show up the next time you run it or vice versa.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:00.280]   So I don't know why they're unreliable in that way,
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:05.780]   but there is some mystery to the results
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.280]   that come back, unfortunately.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.960]   - Yep, and you briefly mentioned awards
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.680]   or alerts are important.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.760]   Point.me does not have alerts,
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.600]   but if I'm using a word tool and I say,
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.920]   well, I do wanna go to Paris
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.920]   and I'd like to do it in business class
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.200]   on a specific date range.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.020]   And let's say there's nothing there.
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.960]   You can say, hey, just let me know.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.800]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.600]   - And you can say track prices almost in the same way
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.820]   you would do on a Google flights,
[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:38.920]   but you can also say, set an alert for a specific route.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.820]   - Right, so you would say, I wanna go to Paris.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.640]   Look at these date ranges and alert me.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.140]   If you find a point price that's less than,
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.340]   I'll make up a number, 100,000 points one way.
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.980]   And you could say, by the way,
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:00.760]   make sure the percentage of premium cabin
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.280]   is more than 60% or whatever.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.960]   And maybe you wanna limit it to,
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.800]   I don't want anything more than one stop connections.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.760]   That's how I use that tool.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.840]   - And you can set the number of people,
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.680]   which I think if you're traveling with three or four people.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.520]   - Oh, that's critical.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.400]   - This whole game is very hard,
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.680]   but you could set, it looks like you set 25 alerts,
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.180]   but similar to the way the search works,
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:28.980]   I'm looking now at setting an alert
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.440]   from San Francisco to Paris for a date range of four days.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:35.520]   That's gonna use four of my 25 alerts.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.360]   - It will.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.880]   - So it's all a currency of how many you have access to,
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.340]   whether it's searching or alerts,
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.440]   but at least you have them.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.840]   And I don't think it's hard.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.680]   I think it's easy to forget.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.980]   You already said this, and I'll just say it again.
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:52.360]   It's easy to forget that this stuff changes all the time.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.200]   - It really does.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.800]   - And so I would tell someone that said,
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   "Hey, I wanna go to Paris on this three date window,
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.080]   like six months from now."
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.520]   And the answer is like,
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.800]   between the day you wanna take off and now,
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.640]   it will probably become available
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.240]   and become unavailable multiple times.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.480]   - That's true.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.200]   And on some routes, some airlines,
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.120]   the chance of it becoming available
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.100]   actually increases dramatically
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.720]   as you get within a few weeks or a few days of the flight,
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.560]   which lends a whole nother fun
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.440]   to people who really wanna live on the edge
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.600]   and wait till the last minute to book their flights.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.480]   But I expect that you and Nick
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.600]   will talk about strategies around that,
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:39.600]   around that idea of booking good enough flights
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.620]   and then setting alerts for things like this.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:44.820]   And if something comes available a few days
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.140]   before your flight,
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.180]   canceling the original and booking the,
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.140]   not in that order,
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:51.760]   and booking the better one.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.180]   So let me re-say that.
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.300]   You wanna book the better one first,
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.700]   make sure that booking works,
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.500]   you don't have any problems booking it,
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.460]   then cancel your original one.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.580]   - If you had the ballpark,
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.780]   these tools didn't always exist, right?
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.520]   It used to be a long process
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.860]   to figure out how to make all of this work out,
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.700]   calling, asking, what about this date?
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.540]   What about this date?
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:17.900]   What about this date?
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.060]   You know, what's been the impact
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.460]   for the ability for you to get maximum value
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.860]   out of your points by having access to all these tools?
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.220]   - Oh, I mean, it's huge because,
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.100]   I mean, it just makes it so much easier
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.480]   to find what you want.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.840]   You don't have to be an expert geek at this stuff
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.160]   to find good things.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.840]   I think that's the biggest change.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.160]   - And finding good things is saving thousands
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.440]   or maybe tens of thousands of dollars
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.040]   by getting the right deal.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.960]   - Right, it's either saving huge amount of money
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:56.560]   or probably often it means flying business
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.320]   or first class instead of economy,
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.880]   which you might've done had you not had access
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.920]   to these awards and these tools
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.840]   to help you find those flights.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.880]   So yeah, it's huge.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.320]   Flip side is, as these tools make it so easy
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.840]   to find these awards,
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.360]   they probably get snapped up faster
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.380]   than they would without the tools.
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:23.380]   And so people who knew before how to find these awards
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.680]   might be frustrated by having fewer available
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.400]   because other people are snapping them up.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.420]   - Yeah.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.480]   Now, two quick tools we didn't talk about much.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.060]   One is PointsPath, which in the last couple of weeks,
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:39.400]   I've actually gotten a lot of use out of.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.080]   And it's a Chrome extension.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.800]   So it doesn't actually have a website.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.360]   I mean, it has a website, but you're not using the website.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:50.360]   And it pops up when you're doing searches on Google Flights.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.980]   And at first glance, I was like,
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.640]   "Hmm, when am I gonna use this?"
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:00.280]   And the example I just searched for did not bear fruit
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.820]   like I had expected.
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.140]   But I recently went to South by Southwest in Austin,
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:06.820]   and I was looking at flights,
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.660]   and I had waited too long to book them.
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.780]   And I was like, "Oh my gosh, flights are really expensive."
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:15.640]   Like $500 one-way flights from San Francisco.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.240]   And on Google Flights, it popped up and said,
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:22.240]   "Hey, just so you know, it's only 12,500 AA miles."
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.860]   And I was like, "What?"
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:27.420]   Like, I blew my mind that I could get such a good deal
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.740]   using points on just a basic domestic flight,
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:33.520]   direct, exact dates I wanted.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.960]   And I almost assumed that I wouldn't get a good deal
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.760]   and never looked anywhere else.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.760]   So I think it's a no-brainer
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.560]   to turn the PointsPath Chrome extension on
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.580]   because I'm already doing my cash searching
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.000]   on Google Flights.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.800]   If it happens to find something,
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.240]   granted, I think it's only searching
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.520]   American United Delta.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.360]   - They just added JetBlue as well.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.320]   - And JetBlue? - Yep.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.560]   - So it's not searching everything,
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.880]   but it is searching enough that I've actually saved
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.120]   a few hundred dollars just in the past few weeks
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.400]   having that extension on.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.000]   - That's a good commercial for that tool.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.200]   Yeah, no, I feel the same way.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.680]   I love having it, not because I would...
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:16.480]   I would never, ever seek it out.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.120]   If they had a website,
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.240]   search here for these four programs.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.880]   I would never seek out this tool,
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.800]   but having it installed in my browser
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.480]   so that any time I use Google Flights,
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.200]   it just automatically shows me the point prices
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.760]   of flights I'm looking for anyway,
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.740]   I find really, really valuable.
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:39.800]   Although I have to say that it's still worth,
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.080]   in the example you gave,
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.600]   running PointsPath or...
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.440]   Or, I'm sorry, running one of the other tools,
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:52.580]   AwardTool or Points, yeah.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.480]   Or really any of these other tools that you like
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.000]   that cover a lot of different programs,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.960]   because you might've found that there was another program
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.360]   that would fly you that same flight
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.360]   instead of 12,500 American miles.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:12.280]   There might've been one that you could book for 8,000 miles,
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.760]   8,000 points, you know, with Avios or something.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.740]   - Yeah, that happens to me all the time.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:21.400]   Domestic flights, find something cheap on United,
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.560]   book it on Avionca for half the price.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.240]   - Yeah, yeah, no, exactly, exactly.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:32.240]   And so that's, again, why these tools are so darn useful.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:36.640]   - Yeah, and then the only other one was Roam Travel.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:41.640]   I'm curious, it made it into this kind of shortlist,
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:46.200]   so what allowed it to make the shortlist,
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.560]   even though we haven't talked about it yet?
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.840]   - Yeah, the reason it made the shortlist
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.540]   is because it was the first tool to compete
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:58.540]   with the expensive older tools,
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:01.660]   AwardLogic and PointMe,
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:07.040]   and it did sort of the similar things as those tools,
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:11.000]   but it's free and fast.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.800]   And so it was the first tool
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.040]   that was really competitive with those,
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:19.320]   but then when Pointia and AwardTool came out,
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.760]   Roam.travel has been kind of left in the dust.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.760]   And so until they leapfrogged those others,
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.080]   at this point, I don't see a reason to turn to Roam.travel,
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:36.160]   but all these tools are constantly innovating,
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.680]   and I'd be surprised if we don't see Roam.travel
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.880]   all of a sudden introduce great new features,
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.920]   and then Pointia will have to come back
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.120]   and get better and so on.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:52.120]   So it's good competition for us as consumers of these tools.
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.640]   - Yep, absolutely.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.120]   Okay, let's talk about flight discovery.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.520]   - Yeah.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:03.520]   So remember, the idea here is you wanna ask broad questions,
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.600]   like, "I have a family of four,
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.360]   and I wanna go to Europe this summer,"
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:14.360]   or, "I just wanna fly international first class to somewhere.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.280]   Doesn't matter where,
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.600]   but show me where the good deals are," things like that.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:23.880]   And there are a bunch of tools that do this,
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.240]   and some of them are the same tools we already talked about,
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.800]   and they have a different mode that does this.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.640]   What's common across all of them
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.760]   is they use cached search results.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.080]   So they do their searches ahead of time,
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.760]   they store all this information,
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:43.760]   and so they can answer these broad queries like this quickly,
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.840]   but you have to keep in mind two things.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:51.840]   One, they don't have all possible flights in there.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.640]   They only have the flights that they've looked at,
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.640]   and the other thing you need to keep in mind
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.000]   is whatever the tools think they know
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.400]   about what's available might not be true anymore,
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.480]   because these are cached,
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.600]   and we don't really have visibility usually
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.960]   into how old the data is.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.360]   Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't,
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:17.360]   but despite those negatives,
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:22.520]   it really is possible to find a lot of things super quickly,
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:27.760]   and then to check the results quickly with these tools,
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.640]   especially, I'll just tell you, I looked at a bunch of them.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.680]   I looked at point.me/explore.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.520]   I looked at Roam's SkyView tool.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.240]   I looked at AwardTool Panorama,
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:45.240]   and Seats.Aero, which is sort of the original tool
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.520]   that does this cached result thing,
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:52.520]   and ultimately, Pointia, their discovery tool
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.620]   is called Daydream Explorer.
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:59.360]   It just kind of beat the pants off all the others
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.400]   in doing the types of things I tested it for,
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:07.520]   and so that's, at least for now,
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.720]   my go-to for finding these things.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.560]   I was able to do like a really,
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.740]   what I thought was a difficult challenge.
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:18.680]   Like in my test, I started in an airport
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:23.680]   that doesn't have, it's not a big airport, Cleveland.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:28.000]   I had to start there and look for a family of four
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.400]   to go business class in the summer to Europe,
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.120]   and I thought, oh, that'll be a really hard thing
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.580]   for any tool to find.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.040]   I found good options immediately through Daydream Explorer
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:48.120]   and through several other scenarios, too.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:53.400]   It had the most complete results and the best features.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:58.860]   And when I talk about features,
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:03.240]   one feature that I really like
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.000]   that some of the others don't have
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.180]   is not just being able to say flexibly
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.380]   where you're going to,
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.800]   like to be able to say I want to go to Europe,
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.640]   but also I want to be able to broadly say
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.960]   I want to come from not just Cleveland
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.920]   but the United States or North America
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:24.080]   because I'm willing to position to another place,
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.320]   or maybe for my return travel,
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.640]   I want to say I'm coming from Europe
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.560]   and going to Cleveland, for example.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.680]   Yeah, I want that kind of flexibility,
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.980]   and Daydream Explorer gives you that.
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:39.320]   Another thing that not all tools do,
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.640]   and this is kind of unbelievable,
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.380]   but Pointsia does do,
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:47.200]   is let you say how many people would be traveling.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.480]   Like, doesn't that seem like
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.540]   that's gotta be the most basic thing that they would all do,
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:56.080]   but it's actually fairly rare in this space so far,
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:00.120]   so that's a obviously really good feature.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.600]   And we talked before about the ability
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.680]   to set minimum premium cabin
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:09.000]   so that you don't want to end up with finding flights
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.240]   that are predominantly economy
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:16.240]   and a short leg in business class that lets you do that.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.180]   Yeah.
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.720]   Now, you might know this
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.160]   'cause I've played with them all logged in,
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:26.720]   but are a lot of these exploration tools available free?
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.080]   Because I do know that Point.me
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:32.760]   made the Explore feature free to everyone recently,
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.000]   and so I don't know if the other tools,
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.400]   exploration tools are free or not.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.000]   Yeah, it depends.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.040]   It varies from tool to tool,
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.700]   but the Pointsia Daydream Explorer,
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.840]   you get full functionality, as far as I could tell,
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.800]   from the free version,
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:50.940]   and so that's pretty awesome.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.440]   Wow, okay.
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.560]   Yeah, I'm playing with them all.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.940]   Some of the features that we haven't talked about
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.660]   that are interesting, I'm looking right now,
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.380]   a lot of them let you pick the kind of trip you want.
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.780]   So you could say ski trip or beach trip
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:05.660]   or that kind of stuff.
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:07.020]   All they've really done is gone
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:09.620]   and just categorized all these airports as to what they are,
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:12.440]   but the ability to go in and say,
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.700]   hey, I want to go to the beach
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.400]   and I want to go nonstop in business class
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.460]   from wherever I am and for four people
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.020]   and come up with something is really cool.
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:23.180]   So I think-
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:24.020]   It is really cool.
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:26.600]   And I have to admit, I did not test them
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:30.300]   to see who could do beach or ski vacations
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.900]   or golf vacations or whatever it is better than the others.
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.580]   I'm dubious about their ability
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:38.460]   to correctly categorize things
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:42.220]   'cause just about anywhere you go,
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:46.380]   it may be a way to get to a beach,
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:51.380]   but it might not be the primary beach you want to go to.
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.100]   Well, I'm seeing some great options
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.940]   for four people from San Francisco
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.560]   to go to the beach right now in Mexico,
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.660]   in Hawaii, on nonstop, first in business.
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.160]   So I am inspired.
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:10.140]   One tool that we haven't talked about yet much
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:11.300]   is seats.arrow.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.820]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:17.460]   So seats.arrow, this is what I think
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:22.340]   has started this whole class of discovery tools.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.700]   It was the first one I knew of anyway,
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:29.700]   where they would upfront run a million award searches,
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.800]   store all the results,
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.180]   and then let you just explore quickly
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:37.940]   to see what's available.
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:42.580]   Now it does it in a very nerdy,
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:46.660]   you have to understand what the two letter codes
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:50.940]   for airlines and airports are and things like that.
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:55.940]   But it's incredibly powerful,
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:01.780]   and I still turn to it regularly for specific things.
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:11.460]   So it's not as good as Points Yes, Daydream Explorer
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:16.460]   for just tell me across all programs,
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:23.020]   where can I fly in business class this summer,
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:23.860]   that kind of thing.
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.380]   It's not really good for that.
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:30.380]   But if you have an idea of more specific things
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:33.100]   that you want, like so for example,
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:38.100]   you know you wanna use your Emirates miles
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.620]   to fly Emirates first class.
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:44.820]   It's a great tool for quickly identifying
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:47.180]   all of the first class award availability
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:50.140]   that it has cached.
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:55.100]   Yeah, I will say the reason why it's a little confusing
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:56.880]   to use and you know this is,
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.220]   when you're browsing the website,
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:00.420]   it's like they have a section called Explore,
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:03.580]   and you pick the program,
[00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:06.800]   and you can do some much broader searching.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.640]   So you could say,
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.100]   just look at everything I can do with Air France,
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.100]   and now I get all these features.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.660]   But when you do your search on that,
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.180]   you're not gonna get any United flights,
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:18.280]   or any Lufthansa flights or anything.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:22.460]   And so the most flexible searching is within a program.
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:25.500]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:29.060]   Also, what you might not realize is that
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:32.440]   if you wanna see Delta flights,
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:35.300]   picking Air France or Virgin Atlantic
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.660]   is what you wanna explore to see Delta flights.
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:41.100]   So you have to know those kind of nerdy things,
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.900]   that that's what this tool does
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:45.400]   is because they're partners with Delta.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:50.400]   And so, yeah, it really was designed
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.920]   for people who know what they're doing.
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.960]   The author of the tool tells me
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:00.480]   he's working on like some sort of mega Explore feature
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:04.640]   where it would maybe combine all of those programs together
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.400]   on one massive Explore,
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.320]   which I would love that,
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.460]   because I'd love the Explore,
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:12.580]   how powerful the Explore interface is.
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:17.580]   And, but it frustrates me that I have to switch
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:21.840]   between programs to do a full search.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.820]   But what I did, I did notice recently,
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:25.320]   so I'm doing a search on my screen.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:28.960]   I went to the search tab, which searches all the programs,
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:33.960]   and search US to Europe in, let's just pick July 15th,
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:39.260]   plus or minus 60 days.
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:44.260]   And I can say for at least two people on direct flights
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:46.800]   and run a search.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.840]   Now, normally I thought this search would work.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:55.000]   In this case I have, we encountered an unexpected error.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.640]   So let's lower it to plus or minus 28 days
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.500]   just to see if it works.
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:02.480]   And so there is the ability to do this.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.620]   I noticed that depending on your from and your to,
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:08.760]   sometimes the number of days gets ratcheted down
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.600]   and down and down.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.160]   If you search US to anywhere,
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.800]   you could do a plus or minus three day search.
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.840]   So it's funny, 'cause we didn't talk about it
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:19.400]   in the first set of tools for searching flights.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.960]   We didn't really talk about it in the discovery.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:25.240]   I find that it's actually probably maybe one
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.920]   of the best tools that does both.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.480]   You just really need to spend time understanding
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.080]   how to use it to get the most out of it.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:36.400]   And for a lot of people, this is not gonna be that.
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.160]   However, I just searched and I said,
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:43.640]   "Hey, I want United States to Europe 28 days
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.860]   "within the middle of July, two people direct flights."
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:50.760]   And I got 17,000 flights.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:53.940]   Now, if I wanted to filter that down to business,
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:55.960]   and let's say I don't have any American miles,
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:58.740]   so I wanna filter out American and Alaska.
[00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:01.560]   I can do that.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.680]   I can filter the number of fees.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.880]   And so you can kind of work your way to get there,
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:09.760]   but I would say highest learning curve,
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:14.240]   but maybe the most ROI if you figure it out.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.320]   - Maybe, maybe, although I wanna point out something
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:20.680]   of the search you just did that you put
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.200]   that you wanna fly to Europe,
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.560]   but that three-letter code, Europe,
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:30.560]   only is bringing in what seats.euro chose to be
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.600]   as major airports in Europe.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:38.800]   - Oh yeah, I'm looking right now and the list is about,
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:42.360]   I don't know, I'm gonna ballpark it at 30 airports maybe,
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.940]   but not all of them.
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:44.880]   - Not all of them.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:49.880]   And so, when I was doing the Poincia Daydream Explorer thing,
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:55.600]   one of the best flights that it found for me to Europe
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:57.380]   was to Lyon, France.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:01.420]   And I bet you Lyon is not a major airport in that list,
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:07.360]   but often flights to smaller airports
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:12.860]   have better award availability, strangely,
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.940]   or at least at better prices.
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:20.940]   So it's weird but true that flying, for example,
[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:26.200]   from Detroit to Paris on Air France to Lyon
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.820]   is sometimes a lot cheaper than just Detroit to Paris.
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:32.280]   So the exact same first leg,
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:36.600]   but adding on a flight to a smaller airport
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.440]   sometimes can lower the price substantially.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:42.400]   And so that's what I was able to find
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:46.140]   with the Poincia tool and what you wouldn't find
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:48.800]   with that particular search you just did.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:52.760]   - Yeah, so I will say I like it.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.880]   It does a lot of stuff.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.500]   You've gotta get used to how to use it.
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:59.720]   But once you figure it out,
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:01.140]   I'm like, "Oh, this is cool."
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.220]   If you really wanna nerd out,
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:04.380]   I think you can export the results.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:07.100]   I think they have an API you can play with.
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:10.700]   So you could really go as deep as you want, but--
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:14.220]   - You really can, and I love it too.
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:17.900]   I don't wanna talk it down at all.
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:19.580]   I just did wanna point out a difference
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:22.020]   between the other tools.
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:25.380]   I also love that they have a tools menu
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:29.620]   with some specialty searches that you can do
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:34.620]   to find things that might be hard to find
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:38.980]   without having those tools there,
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:42.700]   like the Delta One Finder as a way to quickly find
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:45.860]   award flights flying Delta One
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.380]   using Virgin Atlantic miles, for example.
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.800]   - Yeah, I actually used it.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.380]   I had a friend who had some expiring United Plus points
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.700]   and was like, "I got these points that are expiring."
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.300]   I was like, "I wonder where you could go with them."
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:58.740]   And then I just quickly looked up and it's like,
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:01.060]   "Oh, you can go to Japan."
[00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:03.780]   If you wanted to go to Japan in the next two weeks,
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:04.900]   you can use your Plus points.
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:07.700]   And so they've built a lot of cool stuff.
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:11.540]   I think, at least when I've read about how point.me
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:14.000]   is doing their Explore tool,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.380]   they're kind of basing it off of user searches.
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:20.160]   And so I don't know if this is true for all the other tools,
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.940]   but the one thing that I know seats.arrow does
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:28.460]   is they're running a search for a lot of routes every day.
[00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:33.460]   And so if no one has searched for,
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:36.940]   for example, I'm looking a lot of the best West Coast
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.540]   to Europe business class availability this summer
[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:44.540]   seems to be on a lot flight from LAX to Warsaw, right?
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:50.980]   If no one searched for LAX to Warsaw on point.me,
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:53.340]   then you're not gonna get that in the Daydream Explorer,
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:57.620]   even though if you wanna fly to Europe from the West Coast,
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:01.180]   LAX to Warsaw might be a great option in business class.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:04.940]   70,000 points on arrow plan available on one, two, three,
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:08.900]   four, five different days in July and August could be great,
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:10.860]   but a lot of the other tools might not show it
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:13.980]   because maybe someone hasn't searched for it.
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:15.340]   - Right, yeah, that's absolutely true.
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:17.140]   I don't know, I was surprised
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:21.180]   at how many flights points.ya did find.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:26.180]   And so I do wonder if, do they supplement their cash
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:31.860]   with automatically run routes or is there just so many users
[00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:35.900]   because they have a capable product that's free?
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:37.540]   Maybe they have so many users
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:40.260]   that they are cashing a lot of stuff, I don't know.
[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:44.460]   But the flip side of what you just said is true also,
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:49.460]   which is that if the route, if seats.arrow doesn't look
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:55.540]   for the route that you actually want,
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:57.260]   you're not gonna find anything.
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:01.100]   So again, back to my Lyon example,
[00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:03.500]   even if you put in Lyon as a destination,
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:04.700]   you're probably not gonna find anything
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:06.260]   because it probably doesn't have Lyon
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:08.820]   as a route that it searches automatically.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:09.740]   - Yeah, they have an option to say,
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:11.380]   hey, I wanna request-- - Prove me wrong, I'm sure.
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.780]   - Start adding this route to your search list, but--
[00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:16.900]   - That's right, that's right, you can ask them to add it,
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.500]   so that's good, but as far as just stumbling
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:20.780]   upon things that are available,
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:23.400]   you're not gonna be able to do that with something.
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.180]   So yeah, there's pros and cons there,
[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:28.740]   but overall, for those who are really,
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:29.660]   really into this stuff,
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:32.500]   I think Seatside Arrow is an essential tool
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:37.500]   for your toolbox, but it's not for the,
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.340]   it's not a beginner tool by a long stretch.
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:42.380]   - And the one other thing that's nice is,
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:43.900]   when you look at a flight, I'm looking,
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:47.980]   Las Vegas to Gatwick, but it's not probably on BA,
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:49.360]   but when you look at it, it'll say,
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.380]   well, it was last refreshed a day ago,
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:53.180]   but if you click the little info box,
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:56.040]   it's like refreshing with the results of the airline now.
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:59:00.700]   So I do like how, even though they might not have
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:03.880]   availability right now, that's fresh,
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.340]   they will go and get it for you
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:07.660]   without having to jump to another site.
[00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:10.060]   - I like that too, that's a really good thing,
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:15.060]   and it'd be nice if it, sometimes it can be really slow,
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:18.020]   that refreshing.
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:20.180]   - I'm waiting, I'm still waiting right now.
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:22.100]   - Yeah, exactly, it'd be nice if they could figure out
[00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:25.100]   how to speed that up, but still,
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:27.180]   at least it does do that, so that's good.
[00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:30.740]   - Okay, so it sounds like, if you need one tool
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:34.620]   to do it all, Points Yeah is a pretty high runner,
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:38.500]   but if you like doing really complicated,
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:43.340]   five, six, seven airline, airport, date, searches,
[00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:45.980]   you might be better off with Award Tool,
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:48.500]   or Seats.arrow, or some combo of the two.
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:53.180]   - Yeah, yeah, I think that's all true.
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:55.620]   - Okay, I think the only thing we failed to mention
[00:59:55.620 --> 01:00:00.060]   is that Point.me, which I've found to be
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:03.740]   a very comprehensive, yet slow tool,
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.940]   if you have a Built Rewards account,
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:09.260]   which is free, by the way, this is not the Built Credit Card,
[01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:11.020]   this is just the Built Rewards account,
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:14.520]   which anyone can sign up for, in their mobile app,
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:19.420]   you have the ability to do a search on Point.me for free,
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:22.460]   but it's restricted only to the airlines
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.300]   that Built is partnered with,
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:28.380]   which includes many airlines, but not all airlines.
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:33.460]   - Yes, absolutely, it's great to know about that,
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:37.700]   free access through Built, also, there is a URL,
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.300]   so you could bring that up on the website
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:43.740]   by logging into your Built account on a website,
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:47.740]   and we'll get that URL in the show notes.
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:51.140]   - Yep, and then also, one other reason we re-recorded this,
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:54.260]   since then, Amex has announced the same partnership,
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:57.260]   or not the same, a different but very similar partnership,
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.920]   where if you have a US-based Amex card,
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.300]   you can also get access to Point.me
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.760]   with Amex's travel partners.
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:08.260]   So if you had an Amex and a free Built Rewards account,
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.900]   maybe, I haven't done the intersection of,
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:15.140]   but that probably gets you pretty far with Point.me access
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:17.140]   without having to pay for it.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.620]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that's true.
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:20.620]   It might be frustrating
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.460]   when you're trying to decide which to do,
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:27.460]   because right now, anyway, Built has American Airlines,
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:31.500]   and they've probably added Alaska,
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.400]   because that's a new transfer partner.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:38.900]   Amex is not gonna have either one of those,
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:43.920]   but it will have things like Delta,
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:50.380]   and it has a lot of more obscure programs
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:55.500]   that may or may not have better pricing.
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:59.340]   So you could sometimes get some really good price options
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:02.220]   through Amex's transfer partners.
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:03.660]   - Yep, okay.
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:05.900]   So that's flights.
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:06.820]   We covered a lot.
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:10.820]   We actually, I had the idea of bringing up
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:13.780]   a couple other flight tools in our conversation,
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:16.740]   and then I thought, we ended up bringing most of them up.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.380]   I'll share the couple other ones we forgot.
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:20.900]   So we talked about Seats.arrow.
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:22.780]   We talked about PointsPath.
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.440]   We talked about Flight Connections.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.300]   The other few ones I'll have,
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:27.740]   there's one different use case,
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:29.220]   which we haven't talked about,
[01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:34.220]   which is it's not, I want to take a specific route,
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:35.460]   a flight search per se,
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.700]   and it's not, I wanna go somewhere.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.140]   It's, I live in San Francisco.
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:41.580]   I wanna fly to London.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.420]   I really wanna go on the direct flight,
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:46.660]   or I, and that's maybe a poor example
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:48.100]   'cause multiple airlines serve it,
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.560]   but it's, there is a flight you want,
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.780]   and you're willing to be flexible with your dates,
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:54.580]   but you don't really wanna change the from
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:56.480]   or the to and the airline.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.620]   And so there are a couple tools,
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.500]   some part of the tools before,
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:03.380]   and then one we haven't mentioned called Seatspy,
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:06.540]   which is very good for a very unique search,
[01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:10.660]   which is, I would like to fly from San Francisco
[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:14.500]   to Narita in Tokyo on the United flight.
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:18.540]   Tell me which days over the next 365 days
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:21.000]   I can take that flight in business class.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.160]   - Yeah, you know, it does that.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.300]   That's a great example,
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:28.820]   and it does that very, very well.
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:33.820]   It doesn't cover a lot of award programs
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:37.540]   that you might want,
[01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:40.140]   but for those that it covers,
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.860]   it does a pretty good job.
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:45.780]   - Yep, that is the one search case
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.580]   that I find myself, now that we have children,
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:51.320]   thinking, gosh, if we'd love to go to a place,
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.780]   we'd really love the direct flight,
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:55.140]   and we're super flexible with when we would go,
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:57.800]   so let's create a thing, set an alert,
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.140]   and say, just let me know when you find four seats
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.220]   on this exact route.
[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.060]   - Yeah.
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:05.200]   - Or, I'm probably less doing the alert
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.900]   and more, when can we go on this exact route,
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:10.340]   and let's plan a trip around it.
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:13.780]   I could probably achieve that search on another tool,
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:16.540]   but it's the only tool that very,
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:19.580]   kind of in a beautiful, visual way,
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:23.700]   gives me the kind of full year in advance.
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:24.600]   - Right, right. - So.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.440]   - Totally agree.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.780]   You know, seats.arrow kind of does that
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:30.500]   with the routes it tracks,
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.940]   if you know how to use it to do that,
[01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:36.900]   but it's not as clear what's happening
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.540]   as what you're talking about here.
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:40.900]   - Yeah, I'm looking at it on Air France right now.
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:44.580]   One trick, sometimes it shows even when it's very expensive,
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:48.260]   so I'm dialing back the price of the Air France award
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:50.220]   from San Francisco to Paris, and you'll see,
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:53.140]   oh, it looked like there was a lot of availability
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:55.860]   in business class, now I dropped the price,
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:58.100]   and it's like, well, nope, there's not as much,
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:01.400]   but there is still, if you wanna plan a trip in January,
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.460]   some great options.
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.540]   If you wanna plan in April, some great options.
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:08.580]   So, I don't know, I find myself using Seatspy
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:11.420]   more than we gave it airtime for,
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.500]   but it does look like, I think,
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.880]   Award Tool has a new feature called Routes,
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.700]   where you can pull up a route and look at a calendar
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:19.980]   for that route.
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:23.220]   I just think, you know, from a UI standpoint,
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:24.900]   I'm looking at the Award Tool one,
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:26.620]   and it's like a giant list,
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.600]   or I can switch to calendar view,
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.820]   but I'm looking a month at a time for that use case.
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.380]   If it is your use case,
[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:36.020]   I think Seatspy is fantastic.
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:38.940]   I use it a lot because I have that use case,
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:41.260]   but you literally, you can't even search San Francisco
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.220]   to Paris and see all of those flights.
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:44.980]   It is only the ones on Air France,
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:47.380]   and then separately, the ones on United.
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:50.620]   So, despite that I use the tool a lot,
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:53.020]   I wouldn't say I think a lot of people
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:56.340]   would often be in the use case to use the tool.
[01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:57.180]   - Right, right.
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:58.120]   And let me tell you,
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.900]   you might wanna look at using Seatspied Aero.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:06.420]   It's nowhere near as user-friendly and beautiful,
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:09.340]   the result, but you could use their Explore,
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.740]   you could go to the United, Explore,
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:14.300]   and set your from and to airport,
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:17.800]   and you could even set the airline you wanna fly
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.740]   to limit it to, if for some reason
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.420]   you only wanna fly United.
[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:25.980]   And so you could do it that way.
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:30.460]   And then results that come up in green are the non-stops.
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:31.660]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:32.840]   Yeah, I have this pulled up now
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.600]   and I can see how I can search.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:38.460]   And by the way, the filtering on Seatspied Aero,
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:41.020]   knowing what you can put in that search field
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:42.020]   is kind of interesting.
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:45.920]   You can go in and type in like 2024-04
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.420]   to filter it for April,
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:51.980]   which again goes back to how easy is this to use,
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:54.900]   but I will give it a little bit more of a go
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:57.060]   for that use case and see where we end up.
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:01.020]   I will very briefly mention a tool
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.240]   because we've talked about it.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.420]   If you've searched on the internet,
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:06.140]   you've probably heard about ExpertFlyer.
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:09.040]   I will actually go out on a limb and say,
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.880]   for 99% of the people listening,
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:14.820]   ExpertFlyer is probably not going to be that helpful
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.020]   of an award tool.
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:18.620]   Where I have actually,
[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:20.580]   I don't think I've used it for award searching
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.080]   in the last year.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.020]   Where I love it, and I believe it's free,
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:27.740]   is using it for seat alerts.
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:30.860]   Especially as a UnitedSilver member
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:34.900]   who does not get access to Economy+ until check-in,
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:36.420]   I find that at check-in,
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.980]   there's never an aisle or a window available.
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:41.940]   So I just go in and create an alert and say,
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:44.340]   if there's an aisle or a window in Economy+ available,
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:45.420]   email me.
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:49.040]   And I almost always get an email sometime
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:52.100]   in the 24 hours after check-in before takeoff,
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:53.900]   and I can log into the app immediately,
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:56.900]   change my seat, and get a much better seat.
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.060]   - I love that, I love that.
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:02.420]   And I love that that feature is free on ExpertFlyer,
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:05.500]   so you don't even have to subscribe to get that feature.
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.700]   And to be clear, we're not talking about,
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:09.980]   when you say seat alerts,
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:11.580]   we're not talking about award seats,
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:14.740]   we're just literally talking about,
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:16.360]   you already have the booking,
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:19.360]   and you want to switch to a particular seat on the airplane,
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:22.100]   it lets you set up these alerts, and that's awesome.
[01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.560]   - Yeah, I figured it's not worth a whole episode
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:29.220]   on flight tools, not for awards, because the only other tool
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:32.420]   I would mention is for trip monitoring.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:34.540]   And there's 2 tools I've used.
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:36.780]   One is Flighty, and one is TripIt.
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:39.580]   And I think Flighty is a beautiful mobile interface
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:41.060]   for tracking flights.
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.620]   And TripIt might have an app.
[01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.540]   I'm sure it's not beautiful.
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:47.020]   They have a terrible UI.
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.740]   They're now owned by an expense management platform.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:52.180]   But it's pretty good at scanning your email,
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.920]   compiling everything into trips,
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.820]   sending you updates and reminders if flights change,
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:58.980]   or if something happens.
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:02.260]   And especially helpful, even with Southwest,
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:04.380]   at saying, "Hey, your flight dropped in price.
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:06.020]   "You might want to go rebook it."
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:10.420]   - Yeah, yeah, I rely on both of those tools.
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:13.100]   Well, I should say, I rely on TripIt.
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:17.500]   I use Flighty, and I like its features a lot.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.780]   I haven't learned to rely on it.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:23.920]   But with TripIt, the main thing I do
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.440]   is use it to organize my trips.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:31.440]   'Cause I'm often booking multiple separate flights
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.920]   with different airlines, and then I'm booking hotels
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.120]   in one place and the other.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:41.120]   And I just send all the receipts to TripIt
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.160]   and it puts it all.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.800]   I don't let TripIt look at my email,
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.360]   'cause that's too confusing.
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:47.320]   And I'll explain why in a second.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.500]   But by emailing TripIt, all of these things,
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:54.180]   it just automatically puts them into trips.
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:56.980]   And I could then visually see,
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:58.900]   and actually it'll tell me if there's a conflict,
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:02.500]   but I could visually see, yeah, okay,
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:05.660]   I'm gonna arrive in time to catch this next flight.
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:08.580]   Or, oh, I forgot to book a hotel
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.460]   for the first night or whatever,
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.500]   and then I can go take care of that.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:16.700]   One time I was traveling with my co-host, Nick,
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:19.600]   and he was doing the flight planning
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:22.640]   and I was putting all the stuff into TripIt,
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.280]   and then I contacted him to say,
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:28.120]   did you know that we're leaving Dubai
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.460]   before we arrive in Dubai?
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:34.360]   And that's the type of thing that TripIt showed me.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.500]   It's not something you have to do
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:38.120]   like your date math to figure out yourself.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.320]   Yeah, I did not do that.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:44.720]   And last week had a flight home from Austin in May
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.280]   instead of March.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.340]   And had I accurately put it all in,
[01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:52.020]   I would have seen that my not three day,
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:54.460]   but like 63 day trip to Austin
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.020]   and would have quickly made a change.
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:11:00.220]   Fortunately, it was the same number of points to get back.
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:02.380]   So it was actually, it wasn't a big deal.
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:06.020]   I just happened to notice it before it had gotten expensive.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:11.740]   So I used to let some tools just look at my email
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:15.820]   and create trips, like TripIt and Google used to do that.
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:18.620]   I don't know if Google still does that, but I turned it off.
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:23.620]   But I sometimes book like award flights
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:30.640]   just for various reasons that where I know,
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.340]   I'm not actually gonna be flying this thing.
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:35.700]   Maybe I'm testing out how you cancel
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:37.580]   or how you make changes or something.
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:40.460]   And so to have all these things like suddenly appearing
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:44.060]   in my calendar as things I'm gonna do is just,
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.840]   I don't like that.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.840]   I like to be intentional about what goes in there.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.780]   - Let's jump in to the first way
[01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:51.960]   you think about booking hotel tools.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:57.780]   - Yeah, so the first way is basically what I think
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:01.740]   everyone would assume a hotel award search tool would do,
[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:04.660]   which is basically you're planning a trip
[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:08.820]   and you wanna say, I'm going to London.
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:13.820]   I'm going from July 1st to the 6th.
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:17.060]   Show me what hotels are available.
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:19.740]   How much do they cost in points?
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:22.220]   That's what you would kind of expect
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:26.240]   any good hotel award search to be able to do.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.240]   But surprisingly, there's only one that I'm aware of
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:36.980]   that's currently available and does it well enough
[01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:39.580]   for me to talk about.
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:40.420]   - Yep.
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.620]   - I know of one that's sort of in development
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:43.900]   and I've looked at some others
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:45.300]   that are kind of these half-baked tools,
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:47.340]   but they're just not even worth talking about.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:50.500]   So the one that's available is called Aways
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.780]   with a Z at the end.
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:55.800]   And that does all the things I was just saying.
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:13:01.620]   It also, one of the cool things about it,
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:04.720]   it searches like a lot of hotel programs.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:07.780]   So it checks the boxes for the major ones
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:10.740]   like Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, and IHG,
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:15.740]   but it also includes Accor, Choice, and Wyndham.
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:18.200]   And my understanding is they're adding more.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.780]   So that's really nice.
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:23.900]   - And some of those, I'm doing a search right now for Paris
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:28.700]   and Accor has so many hotels in France
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.980]   that it's almost overwhelming.
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:34.700]   But even if I just filter that out, the map is pretty full.
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:38.200]   And if you zoom in, there are a lot of options.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:42.000]   And I just think it's funny that there's like
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.940]   three or four other tools that we could talk about,
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:45.740]   but none of them actually do this thing,
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:48.320]   which is what most people listening probably want,
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.480]   which is, yeah, I'm going to Paris
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.900]   from the 12th to the 16th of April.
[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:55.920]   Where can I stay and is it a good deal?
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.520]   - Right, right, right.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.960]   Years ago, there was a tool called Award Mapper
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:04.960]   that did something similar, but that's no longer available.
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:10.100]   And so finally, with Aways, there's a tool that does this,
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:13.940]   this thing that should be an obvious thing
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:17.520]   that a lot of people do, but no one else currently doing it.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.980]   It lets you do things like search by star rating,
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:23.920]   so you could find the best hotels, I guess.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:28.320]   You could sort by the cost in points or the cost in cash.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:31.720]   You could sort by a best value, or no,
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:35.600]   it'll show you a best value indicator next to each hotel.
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.680]   - You can now sort by that, actually.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:41.740]   I just noticed that the sort includes point value.
[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:44.840]   - Yes, you could sort by point value, yes.
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:48.040]   So that you'll get the best use of your points
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:49.980]   sorting to the top, which is great.
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:54.600]   And then if you click into a hotel,
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.340]   you can view a award availability calendar.
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:03.340]   So maybe your dates for your trip aren't totally set,
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.240]   or maybe the hotel you were interested in
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:09.200]   wasn't available for the whole set of dates,
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.280]   and you wanna see which days is it available,
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:14.600]   you could use their award availability calendar,
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:15.660]   which is really neat.
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:20.920]   - Yeah, I've used Aways for almost every trip
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:25.160]   when it comes to searching for cities and award hotels.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:29.200]   We actually just did a session where the founder of Aways
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:31.440]   for the AllHacks members kind of did
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:32.740]   a full product walkthrough.
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:35.280]   We got to ask questions, one of which was like,
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.980]   they used to roll out city by city.
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:39.360]   So we said like, "What kind of coverage do you have now?"
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.320]   And the answer now is all.
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.280]   We asked like, "When will you have all the hotels
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.120]   "for all the programs?"
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:46.620]   And they were like, "We do."
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:48.880]   And so I think one of the earlier things
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.160]   was they might have only had 100 cities to start,
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:54.060]   but they've loaded in all the cities for all the programs.
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:58.080]   And you just get, I think, one of the best views
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:02.520]   of "I wanna use points on these days in this place."
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.800]   The only thing missing might be some flexibility.
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.780]   If you were like, "I'm going to Paris for a week
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:13.240]   "and I wanna, I could kind of be a little flexible."
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:16.760]   But you're not necessarily set on a specific hotel.
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:19.360]   I think that's one thing you can't do.
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:23.320]   But when it comes to doing that kind of search,
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.960]   it's really great.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:28.840]   - Totally agree.
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:34.560]   The guy who started the company had met with me a while back
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:44.200]   to talk me through the app and show me what I could do.
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:47.320]   And I had every intention of looking at it back then.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:50.880]   And for a few trips that I had planned, I tried to use it.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.640]   But each time I tried to use it,
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:57.000]   the city I was going to wasn't available in the tool.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.600]   And so I gave up until recently.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.840]   Then I looked at it recently and I was like,
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.920]   "Oh, wow, everything is here."
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:06.240]   And so suddenly, magically, it's really good.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:09.520]   I will say I've run into a few cases
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:13.600]   where it uses cash results that were out of date
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.640]   or for some other reason it was wrong.
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:22.640]   But that's like one where it was just flat out wrong
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.800]   with the points that it said it costed.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:28.840]   I sent them an example.
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.240]   And so they're gonna work on that
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:31.740]   and try to figure out what's going on.
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:34.080]   I'm sure they'll fix that.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:38.400]   I just wanna point out that it's not perfect,
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:41.560]   but it is very, very good, I think,
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:43.760]   in doing what it's intended to do.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:46.540]   And since it's the only thing out there
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:50.800]   that does exactly that, it's an easy answer.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:54.280]   - Yep, I will say I just pulled up rooms.arrow.
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:59.040]   And unlike all of the other seats.arrow functionality,
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:03.500]   their hotel search works a little bit more visual
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.840]   than data-organized.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.060]   And so I said the same search for Paris.
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:11.640]   It's designed for a little bit more flexibility.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.320]   It's like what range of check-in dates,
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:15.440]   how many nights do you wanna stay?
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:20.160]   And it shows me less hotels than a ways
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.880]   because I think they're only searching Hilton, Hyatt,
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:27.120]   and IHG, so there's noticeably Marriott
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.280]   is missing from that list,
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:34.080]   as is Wyndham, or Choice Hotels, or Accor.
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:38.800]   But it does have better-than-I-thought ability.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.160]   That said, it immediately popped up and said
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:42.920]   it's refreshing stale results.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:46.680]   So it knew it had stale results, quite a bit of them,
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.040]   but it's refreshing them.
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.620]   But you can't sort by anything.
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:52.740]   So the number one result is the Holiday Inn,
[01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:55.280]   and the number two result is the Park Hyatt,
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:58.740]   of which I would say those are two very different hotels.
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:04.480]   But so it kinda does it, but again,
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.760]   I think a ways is the only tool you can rely on
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.000]   for that kind of search.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   - Right, also, you mentioned that it supports IHG,
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.080]   Hyatt, and Hilton, but it's important to note,
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.640]   and I'm talking about seats, or sorry,
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.740]   what is the hotel version of Seat Center?
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:30.560]   It does not include all IHG hotels,
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:35.000]   all Hyatt hotels, all Hilton hotels, not by a long shot.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.840]   It has a database of ones that it looks at,
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.680]   and that's all it does.
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:44.440]   - So searching Paris, it probably hit the core
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:45.960]   of where a lot of people are looking,
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.760]   but if I searched to a more obscure place,
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:48.760]   it probably wouldn't work.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:52.000]   - Try Lexington, Kentucky.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.040]   I bet you'll find like one hotel or something.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.300]   - One hotel?
[01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:59.140]   (laughing)
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:19:59.980]   All right.
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:09.280]   - All right, so that's the basics of a ways
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.900]   and hotel trip planning.
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:15.640]   One thing that we didn't mention when talking about a ways
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:17.760]   is that you can also set alerts.
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:20.560]   So if you found a hotel that you wanna stay at,
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:24.480]   it's not available, you can set up an alert
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:27.320]   to email you when it becomes available.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:33.360]   And the nice thing with hotels, even more than flights,
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:38.360]   is availability does change a lot.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:44.760]   Even more than flights do, and partially because,
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:47.300]   I think a lot of people book hotels
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:50.880]   with free cancellations and do cancel.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.400]   And so as you have cancellations,
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:57.000]   the word inventory automatically goes in,
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.080]   and then you can book it.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:02.520]   So that's a really nice feature.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.600]   And that's a feature that gets us
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.240]   to the other category of hotel tools.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:10.240]   So if you're not doing this sort of broad,
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:13.520]   if you're not doing planning for a specific trip,
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:16.680]   but rather have like a hotel in mind
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:18.740]   that I wanna stay at this hotel,
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:23.380]   but I'm having trouble finding award availability,
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:25.900]   that's where there's a whole host of tools
[01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:27.460]   that try to help you with that.
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:32.140]   Some of them started because Hyatt
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:36.300]   does not have an award availability calendar.
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:40.140]   So unlike Marriott and Hilton and even IHG,
[01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:42.100]   you could bring up one if you know how,
[01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:46.680]   there's no way with Hyatt by itself
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:51.080]   to see for a given hotel, which days can I use points?
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:56.040]   It'll tell you how much it'll cost in points
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:59.300]   if it's available, but not whether or not it's available.
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:03.520]   So these tools grew up to answer that,
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.840]   to be able to answer that question and more.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:11.600]   And the first thing that each of these,
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:14.060]   most that most of these tools offer
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:17.860]   is a full year calendar of award availability.
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:20.100]   And so we saw a Waze has that,
[01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:24.300]   but there's a bunch of other tools that have that as well.
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:29.300]   And so I looked at award tool has a hotels feature.
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:33.300]   I looked at that, I looked at rooms.arrow,
[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:34.740]   which we were just looking at as well.
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:38.520]   I looked at max my point and stay with points.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:43.520]   So it's interesting 'cause as you're saying this,
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:48.780]   I'm playing with these tools
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:51.700]   and searching for a few different hotels.
[01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:54.780]   And it's just funny how some of them
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:58.160]   have very different ways to express a hotel.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:01.860]   So I'm looking at one of the properties near me,
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:04.380]   which is notably hard to stay at,
[01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:07.420]   which is the Alila Ventana Big Sur.
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:11.700]   And I'm laughing because award tool says 66% available,
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:14.020]   meaning according to them,
[01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:16.220]   66% of the dates have availability
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:20.080]   and stay with point says 0% available.
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:25.220]   Yet when I click on it, even though it says 0%,
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.880]   it has lots of dates that show availability.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:31.880]   So I know that's one example of a place
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:35.180]   people are often trying to find a dream stay at.
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:38.260]   But I'm curious whether you think some of these tools
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:39.380]   have better coverage,
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:42.540]   'cause I don't do a lot of hotel searching,
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:45.760]   but I recently, my wife was looking
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:47.780]   to book a stay at the Miraval,
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:50.100]   which is a pretty good Hyatt redemption
[01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:52.240]   in terms of cents per point.
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.980]   It is a lot of points, but for those points,
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:58.340]   you end up getting an all-inclusive high-end resort.
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:03.340]   And they even throw in $175 per person per day
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:06.700]   of resort credit when you book with points,
[01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:08.740]   but it wasn't available on every platform.
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:11.120]   So it left me wondering,
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.660]   is one of these tools better for coverage?
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:14.900]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:18.020]   So I mean, a Waze has by far the best coverage
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:20.800]   because it has all hotels,
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.460]   but it doesn't do some of the key things
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:25.940]   that we're gonna talk about in a moment.
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:30.140]   Of the tools that do like more advanced stuff
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:33.260]   for finding availability, Max, my point,
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:37.220]   in my opinion, seems to have the best coverage.
[01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:39.820]   - I will say as I'm looking at these tools,
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:42.340]   coverage doesn't, I would just completely skip
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:44.740]   over this availability percentage.
[01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:46.820]   I don't know if you got value out of it,
[01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:49.220]   but if you're looking on video now
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:51.860]   or if you just wanna hear my voiceover,
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:55.340]   they say the percentage of reward nights available to book
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:57.580]   in the following 365 days,
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:00.500]   and I'm clicking through and in April,
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:01.900]   it's almost every day.
[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:04.100]   In May, it's almost every day.
[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:06.020]   And in June, it's a handful.
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:08.340]   Like it seems like it is available.
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:10.940]   Now, what I think it's saying is percentage
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:12.460]   of reward nights available to book
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:14.500]   with a standard priced award.
[01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.040]   It doesn't say that,
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:19.680]   but unless that's what it's trying to say,
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:23.320]   I don't understand how they're calculating it,
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:26.800]   but I'll let you did more research than me.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:30.160]   - No, it's funny you called that out
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:32.040]   because that's something I noticed early on
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.120]   and I just stopped looking at it.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:36.360]   So I haven't tried to figure out
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:40.320]   which tool gives a close to accurate answer on that.
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.060]   I just haven't looked at that.
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:47.000]   Let's talk about some of these things the tools can do.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.280]   We talked about that they can all be used
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:53.580]   to look at a full year of award availability.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.680]   They're all using cash data.
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:59.960]   So they're all wrong to some extent.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:06.440]   And the best ones show you when it was last updated.
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:08.680]   So you could at least know,
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:11.660]   is this reasonably good data or not.
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:19.880]   They all let you set alerts to find out
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.920]   when the room becomes available,
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:24.720]   but that's where they vary a lot
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.760]   because some of them like a Waze,
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.700]   you have to set a specific date range
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:36.380]   and either that hotel's available in that date range or not.
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:43.600]   But what if you just want to be alerted
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:47.320]   anytime across a whole year
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:51.740]   that there are new awards available at this hotel?
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:53.180]   Max, my point can do that.
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.280]   What if, or what if you want to know,
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.720]   alert me anytime there's five days in a row
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:05.720]   available in December at this like Maldives resort
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.760]   or whatever, Stay With Points can do that.
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:12.320]   So they have different like advanced alerting features
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:16.360]   that can be really important in different situations.
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.480]   - Okay, so do you have a favorite or?
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:23.480]   - Yeah, Max, my point seems to change
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:27.080]   and seems to check most of the boxes pretty well
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:32.080]   for sort of this kind of advanced searching,
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:37.120]   the ability to find these hard to get awards
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.720]   at places like Alila Ventana.
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:43.960]   And so like Max, my point,
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:47.160]   it supports all four of the major programs,
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:49.420]   Hilton, Hyatt, IHG and Marriott.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.720]   And just to give you an example,
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:58.520]   like rooms.arrow doesn't support Marriott
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:03.520]   and Stay With Points doesn't support IHG.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:11.380]   Max, my point also will let you set alerts
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:15.480]   to alert you if the price drops.
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:18.940]   So let's say you've booked an IHG awards day.
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:24.880]   Excuse me, IHG award prices change like all the time.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:29.440]   And so you'd wanna know if the price goes down
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:32.880]   and be able to rebook it then for the lower price.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:37.880]   So you could set up Max, my point to let you know
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.760]   when that IHG hotel has dropped in price
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.760]   from whatever you booked, you just have to put in that total.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:52.440]   And it also has a really good filtering features
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:53.700]   on its homepage.
[01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:57.180]   So let's say what your goal is to,
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:00.320]   let's say you've got some of those Hilton
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:06.240]   free night certificates that are good at any Hilton worldwide.
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:10.640]   And so what you wanna do is stay at one of these
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:13.640]   like really hard to get Hilton properties
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:16.280]   like the Waldorf Astoria in the Maldives
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:20.680]   or the Waldorf Astoria in Los Cabos.
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:26.880]   Those are really hard to find, but you can,
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:32.040]   well, you can use the alert features
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.240]   to let you know when they're available.
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:36.080]   But if what you're trying to do is just find
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:41.080]   the best hotels that are bookable with Hilton points,
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:48.720]   you could use Max, my points homepage and filter to Hilton,
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:51.600]   filter to properties costing, let's say,
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:54.580]   between 100 and 150,000 points,
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:58.320]   which would get you to their top end hotels.
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:01.560]   And then you'll see it all and you can sort
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:05.480]   by like most popular and you'll quickly see some
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:07.040]   that you might wanna target.
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:11.720]   - Okay, yeah, I do not have a paid membership
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:14.120]   for Max, my point, which I want only
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:16.160]   because it is the only one of these sites
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.800]   that has ads all over it.
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:19.340]   And I would love to make them go away.
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:23.840]   So that's my next investment is a Max, my point membership.
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:27.080]   - You know, what's funny when I first looked
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:29.840]   at Max, my point, the free version,
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:32.040]   it had way more ads than it does today.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:34.640]   It was almost unusable.
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:37.840]   It had so many ads and they were constantly covering
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:39.360]   out what I was trying to do.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:42.440]   So today, yeah, it still has a lot of annoying ads,
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:44.360]   not nearly as many as before.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:49.360]   So I didn't mention that, but that is true.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:53.120]   And the free version, if you could stand the ads,
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:58.120]   it's fairly capable, but the paid version might be worth it
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:00.040]   if you do a lot of this kind of thing.
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.160]   - And we didn't talk much about the hotel tool
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:04.240]   from award tool, where does that fit in?
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:08.240]   - It's sort of middle of the pack, in my opinion.
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:14.080]   It has some decent features, but it didn't beat out Max,
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:21.640]   my point on any of the types of things I looked at.
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:25.400]   But I guess the way I think about it,
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:29.840]   if you're using award tool anyway for flight searches,
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:31.960]   you might as well check whether it does,
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:34.160]   it can do what you want with hotels as well,
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:35.640]   'cause you're in there anyway.
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:37.760]   But if it can't, then go onto another tool
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.160]   like Max, my point.
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:42.480]   - Yeah, and I think you probably have gone deeper down
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:47.480]   the hotel search award tool rabbit hole for hotels.
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:50.080]   Then I've kind of done a lot in flights,
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:54.000]   hotels, I'm kind of like, I'm gonna find my flight,
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.880]   and then I'm gonna just kind of see what's available
[01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:58.120]   at these hotels and make it work either way.
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:02.680]   But especially when you have cool things nearby
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:03.960]   that you can drive to,
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:06.840]   or if you have a lot of flexibility in your travel,
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:09.800]   I feel like I'm underusing the hotel tools.
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:11.560]   So personally, I'm excited,
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:14.120]   'cause this episode made me understand
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.880]   that there's more I can be doing.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:18.360]   - Yeah, I mean, I would totally,
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:21.200]   I love Lila Ventana, Big Sur,
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:24.680]   and if I was in driving distance like you are,
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:26.440]   I would totally be setting up.
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:31.880]   The Max, my point has these daily alerts,
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:35.800]   which you have to have the paid version to do it,
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:37.640]   but it'll basically,
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.400]   every time a word availability change at all,
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:40.600]   it'll send you an email saying,
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.560]   here's all the dates that's available.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:46.960]   And then I would just scan it each morning and say,
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:49.600]   oh, there's a date that I might wanna go,
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.160]   so let's go ahead and book it.
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:55.760]   And of course, you can cancel if you change your mind.
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:58.600]   - Yeah, I mean, the idea that we live
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.800]   less than two hours away,
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:03.440]   work from home and could go on a weekday,
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:08.440]   and still haven't been to Ventana is a little crazy
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:09.440]   for me to think about,
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:13.480]   but maybe that'll be on the 2024 before the end of the year.
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:14.680]   Let's tick that box.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:17.840]   - Well, of course, you have kids,
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:20.880]   and Ventana is adults only,
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:25.880]   so maybe that's a getaway for you too.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:29.440]   - I need to set up a Gmail filter
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:32.440]   that forwards the Ventana alert availabilities
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.920]   to my parents and just say,
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:36.880]   hey, every time I'm gonna keep sending you this,
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:39.280]   if any of the dates align and you wanna come down
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:42.120]   and hang out with the kids for a couple of days,
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.360]   maybe I need to swap it with them.
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.200]   Maybe I need to, if they're listening,
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:47.080]   maybe this is too much of an offer,
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:49.320]   but it's like, well, I'll book four nights,
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:50.280]   we'll take them for two,
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:52.680]   and then you can go down and take the other two nights
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:55.640]   as an exchange for watching the kids.
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:57.240]   - Yeah, yeah, that sounds great.
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:02.240]   So is there a hotel in the Bay Area that you do,
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.120]   like going, that you've been to,
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:07.080]   and you'd recommend that it's worth watching
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.080]   the word availability for that one?
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:14.000]   - I wish, I don't think I've stayed at a Bay Area hotel
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.860]   in a very, very long time.
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:18.000]   - I guess that makes sense.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:18.840]   You have a house. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:19.760]   We live here.
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:23.120]   The one that I've heard a lot about,
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.600]   which I have not stayed at,
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:29.200]   but the Alila that in Napa just opened,
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.320]   and I've heard great things about the Alila in Napa
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.120]   for people looking to do a little escape to wine country.
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:38.800]   I have stayed at the Westin Verasa in Napa,
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:41.600]   and I wouldn't say it's a hotel
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:44.600]   I would plan an entire vacation around,
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.280]   but I would say if you're in Napa
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:50.920]   and you don't wanna go for something wild, it's great.
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:53.000]   It's a great hotel.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.160]   I'm sure the Alila is probably nicer,
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:59.720]   but it suited every need we had when we were there
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:03.000]   before my parents moved to Napa, and we can stay with them.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.160]   - That sounds good.
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:10.880]   Let me talk about a special use case
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.400]   that I mentioned briefly,
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:16.080]   but there's a hotel in Michigan
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.360]   that I really like going to called the Inn at Bay Harbor.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.740]   It's a Marriott hotel,
[01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:24.840]   and it's, of course, very popular in the summertime
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:28.520]   'cause it's very cold other times,
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:29.880]   and it's right on Lake Michigan.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:30.840]   It's beautiful.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:35.440]   Award availability in the summer is very hard to find,
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:41.440]   and they don't show one-night award availability.
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:44.840]   So if you're looking just one night at a time,
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:46.720]   you're not gonna see anything.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:49.560]   If you use Marriott's flexible dates calendar
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:51.600]   and just say, "I wanna look for one night,"
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:52.860]   it's not gonna show any availability,
[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:54.840]   but if you look for two nights,
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:57.360]   then things might show up if there's anything there,
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.040]   but most of the time, there's nothing there.
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:04.040]   So there's two ways of handling that.
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:06.600]   One is stay with points.
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:09.680]   We'll let you create an alert that says,
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.280]   "Show me any time for the month of June
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:16.180]   "or the month of July when there's two nights available
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:17.680]   "any time in the whole month."
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:20.420]   That's one way.
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:23.920]   The other way, and what I did this year,
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:27.640]   is I use MaxMyPoints Any Day Alert,
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:31.540]   and its Any Day Alert won't tell me
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:33.440]   when there's summer availability,
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:38.440]   but what it does tell me is when a lot of things
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:42.380]   have changed with availability at this Marriott.
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:46.980]   So I'll see a flood of nights all of a sudden open up
[01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:51.980]   in the spring, and so then I jump onto Marriott's website
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:55.400]   and do a flexible date search in the summer
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:59.560]   of two or more days, and then I've been able
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:01.600]   to find awards that way.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.800]   So it sort of triggers me to look on Marriott's website
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:05.740]   when it's time.
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:09.640]   - So that would be a great example of a place
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:10.800]   that you keep an eye on.
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.520]   Any other hotels you've stayed at
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:16.140]   that you thought were just such amazing properties
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:18.080]   and good deals for the points that,
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:19.880]   if people were looking to get inspired,
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:23.600]   where should they go explore some of these special,
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:26.600]   kind of impossible-to-find hotel awards?
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:32.440]   - Yeah, a few come to mind, but they're SLH properties,
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:36.480]   which are no longer bookable through Hyatt,
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:41.480]   but they should become available through Hilton soon,
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:44.280]   so maybe it'll still be relevant.
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:47.820]   You know that Hilton has taken over a partnership
[01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:49.660]   with SLH that Hyatt used to have.
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:54.580]   So most notable that I can think of
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:56.940]   are in Queenstown, New Zealand.
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:38:00.140]   There are two amazing properties.
[01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:03.100]   I stayed at one of them, but I've seen videos
[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:08.100]   of the other one, and the one I stayed at
[01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:10.500]   was just amazing, like the,
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:14.800]   I'm trying to think of what it's called.
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:17.800]   It's not coming to me off the top of my head,
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:21.800]   but it's right on the lake.
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:25.280]   The base rooms are huge suites,
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:30.280]   and breakfast is included, and it's incredible.
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:31.320]   - Icarts.
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:36.720]   - Icarts, yeah, private hotel.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:39.020]   Icarts private hotel, that's what it is, yep.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:45.840]   And they have a evening like cocktail hour
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:51.920]   where you come in and there's like a host there
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:55.520]   who asks you what you want to drink,
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:00.100]   prepares your drinks, and then asks you
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:02.520]   if you have any dietary restrictions,
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.200]   and then goes and tells the chef
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:08.440]   that we're ready for the chef to prepare our canapes.
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:13.440]   And so the chef then custom creates some snacks, basically,
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:21.600]   for us while we're enjoying the complimentary drinks.
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:25.840]   So very special hotel, and in probably
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:29.400]   the most unbelievable location in Queenstown, New Zealand
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:34.400]   that you can get, so that would be a great one.
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:38.640]   - Yeah, for me it's, we've stayed at the Conrad
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:41.240]   and the St. Regis in Bora Bora,
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:46.240]   and because San Francisco has direct flights to Tahiti,
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:49.360]   it's like just such an easy place to get to,
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:53.200]   but if you, the difference between getting a room
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:57.200]   for a good deal on points and paying full price
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.500]   can like triple the cost.
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.800]   So like if you, I've done an episode I'll link to
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.600]   in the show notes about going to Bora Bora,
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.760]   but if you can find a time where United
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.440]   has saver business availability,
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:11.940]   you can book with Aeroplan, and the St. Regis
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:15.960]   has kind of pretty affordable deals, or the Conrad does,
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:19.120]   all of a sudden you're going on a $30,000 trip
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:21.040]   for a fraction of that.
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:23.280]   If you pick a different week, you might be going
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.480]   on a $30,000 trip for $30,000,
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:29.080]   which is not a trip I'm excited to go on.
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:32.160]   So I think if you can time the flight
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.880]   and hotel award availability to Bora Bora,
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:38.320]   you can go on just an incredible trip
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:43.040]   that's less than eight hours plus a short 30-minute flight
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:46.520]   from the West Coast that can't be beat.
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:47.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:50.580]   No, it's interesting, there are certain hotels like this
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:54.160]   where it's probably worth planning your trip
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:56.500]   around the hotel availability,
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:59.240]   whereas there are many trips,
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:01.240]   like if you're going to a big city,
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:04.360]   where you might wanna plan the trip
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:07.520]   around the flight award availability,
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:09.360]   'cause you know you're gonna be able to stay somewhere nice,
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:10.820]   there's so many options.
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:15.100]   But when going to Bora Bora, the Maldives, places like that,
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:19.040]   you might wanna find the resort first
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.040]   and then book your flights.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.480]   Yeah, the only thing I'll say is,
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:24.000]   we've never done the Maldives
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.080]   only because it's just so far away,
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:31.160]   and I don't know how, I'm sure someone will send me an email
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:33.960]   and tell me how much better it is than Bora Bora,
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:37.040]   but for being three times farther away
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:40.520]   and not even close to a direct flight
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:42.200]   for the majority of the long haul,
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:44.800]   for me, it's like, wow, it's just not even worth it.
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.480]   But the crazy thing about Tahiti
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:50.680]   is that because you can time it,
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:51.960]   if you take two different airlines,
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:54.080]   you can't take the same airline and make this true,
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.740]   but you can take day trips for both of them.
[01:41:56.740 --> 01:42:01.460]   So an eight-hour flight during the day in economy
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:04.700]   is pretty doable, it's a couple hours longer
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:06.320]   than going to the East Coast.
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:10.260]   It's not, if you're used to using your miles and points
[01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:14.980]   to splurge on business, I'm not even sure it's necessary.
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:16.900]   Now, if you have enough points, why not?
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:20.780]   But whereas to go to the Maldives,
[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:24.500]   I think the experience of flying eight hours to Bora Bora
[01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:27.780]   or to Tahiti in coach is not probably the same
[01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:31.340]   as flying to the Maldives almost 24 hours,
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:36.300]   but I don't know, 10 years ago with no kids,
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:37.600]   you could have put me in the middle seat
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.440]   in the back of the plane,
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:39.820]   I would have been fine to go either places.
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:42.740]   I just think once you played the points game long enough,
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:45.700]   you're like, well, there's gotta be a way I can do it
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:46.620]   for a better deal.
[01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:50.320]   - Yeah, and I think you're getting at a point here
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.020]   which is like, for you,
[01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:54.940]   if you're gonna be traveling with four people
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:59.900]   and if you're looking at places that are really far away,
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:03.740]   then the flight availability almost has to be
[01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:06.020]   more of the driver, right?
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:09.540]   Than the resort or hotel award availability.
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:13.960]   For me, usually traveling just my wife,
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:18.600]   I know I can find something in business class
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:22.480]   to just about anywhere, anytime I might have to fly,
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:28.240]   I might have to make a positioning flight or two
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:31.040]   to make it happen, but I can usually find something.
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:33.200]   - Yep, and I think just for anyone listening
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:35.960]   who's maybe new to the points and miles world,
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:38.280]   I always think it's funny that when I talk about
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:40.520]   looking for flights to places, I'm always like,
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:42.000]   well, I couldn't find business class,
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.560]   so we're gonna find another date.
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:47.000]   Just to be clear, I don't think I've ever spent
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.000]   the five to $20,000 those business class flights take.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.320]   This is not me speaking out of a desire to spend
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:57.720]   on that level of luxury.
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:01.640]   It's just that if you figure out how to use these tools,
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:04.920]   if you figure out how to time the card bonuses
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:07.680]   and your spend and all the other stuff
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:09.080]   that you talk about on your show
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:11.300]   and I've talked about on my show,
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:13.840]   you end up getting to a point that you're somewhat spoiled
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:16.880]   to the fact that you can find a way to do it
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:20.200]   in a premium cabin at a very reasonable price
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:21.840]   almost every time.
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:26.840]   - Exactly, and the points and miles, it's amazing.
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:31.840]   It lets you do things like this routinely
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:34.160]   that you would have never even considered
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:36.600]   like forking out the cash to do.
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:40.080]   I mean, things like staying at these resorts
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:42.280]   that cost like $2,000 a night,
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:44.760]   several of the ones we mentioned before,
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:46.120]   we didn't talk about the prices,
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.600]   but would be in that range
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:51.320]   or flying business class for, as you said,
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:54.440]   anywhere from 5,000 to $20,000.
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:58.540]   Those are not things I would consider paying cash for,
[01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:01.440]   but points makes all those things accessible.
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:03.240]   And so that's what I love about it.
[01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:04.700]   And we do become spoiled.
[01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:09.700]   I laugh at my wife who, like, well, we were,
[01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:11.400]   what was the last one?
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.440]   When we flew Air France business class,
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:15.440]   it was kind of an older plane.
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:20.440]   But it was fully lie flat, direct aisle access.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:24.240]   And she's like complaining about how it wasn't as nice
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:25.760]   as the previous flight we were on.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:29.960]   And I just love that we could be that spoiled.
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:34.060]   Complain about it even though it's still incredible luxury.
[01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:36.800]   - Yes, and still not have to pay
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:38.640]   anywhere near full freight, which is great.
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:43.640]   Yeah, this trip to Miraval was just a two night stay.
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:47.040]   The rack rate for the same dates
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:49.640]   was over $6,000 for two nights,
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:52.200]   which is like, it wouldn't even be an option.
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:54.320]   Like we would just never do a trip like that.
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:56.480]   And unfortunately on this trip, I'm not actually going.
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:58.000]   My wife is going with a friend of hers
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.240]   to celebrate a birthday.
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:02.520]   And so I'm gonna have her join on the show
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:04.560]   sometime after she stays in April
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:07.760]   to give a little rundown of how that trip was.
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:09.960]   And she can share with everyone.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:11.600]   But the only other thing I wanted to mention
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:14.940]   before we wrap is on hotels,
[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:18.680]   if you are not finding what you want,
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:22.920]   but you are still looking for a little bit of like a perk
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:25.840]   or a benefit in the luxury travel world,
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:30.200]   there are a lot of different ways that you can book a hotel
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:32.440]   and add on a lot of different perks.
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:35.240]   And so anyone with an Amex knows that Amex
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:37.160]   has the fine hotels and resorts program.
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:40.320]   Chase and Capital One have all launched those.
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:44.120]   We launched our own at hotels.allthehacks.com
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:45.080]   where you can search.
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:49.120]   And I think you actually just used it to book something.
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:51.040]   Am I right or no?
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:52.720]   Someone just texted me and they just used it.
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:54.720]   I don't know why I thought it was you.
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:59.680]   Anyways, and we set our own at hotels.allthehacks.com
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:02.720]   where you can search for kind of the higher end
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:05.560]   four or five star hotels and get access to perks
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:10.160]   like free breakfast, resort credit,
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:12.720]   free upgrades, early check-in, late checkout.
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:15.140]   And so I would say, I would encourage everyone
[01:47:15.140 --> 01:47:16.700]   to figure out how to use their points and miles,
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:18.840]   use everything we talked about in this episode
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:22.400]   to get your stay for free and get all kinds of stuff.
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:24.320]   But if you end up spending dollars
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:27.840]   and you are staying at a nice higher end hotel
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:29.840]   and you have to pay for it,
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:32.720]   chances are through one of these platforms,
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:37.080]   you can get a pretty awesome set of perks added on
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:40.840]   for the same as the rate you typically pay at the website.
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:43.760]   Might not be the same as the discounted corporate rate
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:45.200]   you have through your employer
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:49.000]   or a last minute hotel tonight rate.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.620]   But basically we found a partner
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:54.680]   that would help us give everyone access to,
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.520]   I think it's a 4,000 hotels.
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:59.400]   I think Chase and Capital One might have like a thousand,
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:01.720]   Amex has two or three and we have 4,000.
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:04.240]   So I think we have a bigger selection of them.
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:05.560]   Nice.
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:09.120]   But you can get all those same perks if you want, so.
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:09.960]   Sweet.
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:13.040]   And is there any fee to use that service?
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:13.880]   No, no, no.
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:16.200]   It's a free site that we set up with a partner
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:18.060]   and the goal was just to get everyone access
[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:21.760]   to all of these perks and not have to,
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.600]   there's no booking fee.
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:24.620]   I think, I can't remember if Fine Hotels and Resorts
[01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:25.620]   still has a booking fee.
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:28.160]   I think maybe with points or something, but-
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:29.120]   No, there's no booking fee.
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:31.760]   No, there used to be a Amex travel booking fee,
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:33.440]   but maybe that was for something else.
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:34.280]   Okay.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:35.100]   Yeah, I don't remember.
[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:37.080]   But anyways, there's no fee.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:37.920]   You can book it.
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:39.940]   You can cancel your awards.
[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:42.200]   I will say to provide this,
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:45.000]   we had to make some UI sacrifices.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.100]   So the tool that you'd use is not the easiest to use.
[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:52.040]   But if you go to hotels.allthehacks.com,
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:52.880]   you can find a thing.
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:56.360]   I'll actually go to, if you go to allthehacks.com/upgrade,
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:58.260]   I'll put a video if people want help
[01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:00.360]   walking through the tool.
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:02.880]   But yeah, you should get access to all that.
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:03.720]   I don't know.
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:04.540]   That's all I got for hotels.
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:05.380]   It sounds good to me.
[01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:06.720]   That's all I've got too.
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:07.560]   (laughing)
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:11.000]   Greg, where can everyone go?
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.120]   'Cause you dive into this stuff way deeper than we do.
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:16.320]   Where can people find what you're reading, writing,
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:18.760]   and talking about on your show?
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:21.200]   Yeah, so start at frequentmiler.com.
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:23.320]   That's where you'll find our blog
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:24.960]   and links to our podcast,
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:27.260]   which is called "Frequent Miler" on the air.
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:30.020]   And you'll just find a wealth of information.
[01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:33.100]   We have resource guides about all these things.
[01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:38.100]   We have the best list of credit card offers on the internet.
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:45.140]   Unlike most other websites,
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:50.780]   we only post the best offer that we know about
[01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:54.660]   for the reader.
[01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:58.680]   And we don't list offers that are inferior.
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:03.680]   So, for example, there might be a 120,000 point
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:08.680]   Amex Platinum offer that is available on most websites.
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:10.980]   But if you go to our website right now,
[01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:12.880]   as we're recording this anyway,
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:17.240]   you'll find 150,000 point offer listed there.
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:20.920]   We don't earn anything from you clicking through that offer,
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:24.100]   but we think it's the right thing to do
[01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:28.000]   to show the offer that gets people the most points.
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:30.960]   Rather than what would pay us.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:34.300]   So that's a big deal.
[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:37.500]   And yeah, as I mentioned,
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:40.500]   just tons of different resources about how to earn points,
[01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:43.780]   how to use them, how to shortcuts to elite status,
[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:44.620]   things like that.
[01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:46.340]   Things that Chris talks about all the time,
[01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:50.360]   but you might get more in-depth on the blog there.
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:51.920]   - Greg's underselling it.
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:54.280]   There is so much good stuff.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:56.380]   Your podcast is one of the few that I listen to
[01:50:56.380 --> 01:50:57.980]   every time an episode comes out
[01:50:57.980 --> 01:51:01.800]   because I love going deep on this stuff.
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:04.820]   It gives me so much inspiration for ideas to talk about
[01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:06.760]   and podcasts to do with you and Nick,
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.220]   and we'll see where it goes from there.
[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:11.080]   So definitely check out the podcast, the website,
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:15.220]   and reach out to either one of us if you have questions.
[01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:16.460]   - Absolutely.
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:17.300]   - All right.
[01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:18.940]   Thanks so much.
