[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   If a baby comes out, do they check their eyes right away?
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.160]   And if so, how?
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.280]   And how often should they check, and what kind of information is there?
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.560]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.160]   It's obviously something that touches us all.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.000]   So the answer to that really differs a little bit at the different stages of life.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.760]   First of all, every baby gets an eye exam, or should be getting an eye exam.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.880]   And one of the main things that you really just are screening for right when that baby
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.600]   is born, right in the nursery, right in those first few days, is to just look for a red
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.600]   reflex.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.520]   You know when you take a camera picture, a flash picture, and sometimes you get red eye?
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.840]   That's actually the light from the flash, as you know, reflecting against the retina
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.240]   and coming back out of your eye, it looks red.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.960]   And a red reflex is actually very normal.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.960]   That's great.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.760]   And if you have one of a number of diseases in the eye that can present even in babies,
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.680]   even in newborn babies, including most concerning, but thankfully least common, retinoblastoma,
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.840]   which is the most common pediatric eye cancer, which again, thankfully, is quite rare, those
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.520]   babies won't have a red reflex in that eye.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.920]   It'll be kind of a whitish or gray reflex.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.760]   And so even just that first little, you know, doctors taking the little pen light and even
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.960]   just flashing it in the baby's eyes.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.440]   So that's our first eye exam.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.800]   And hopefully we've all had that.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.680]   And hopefully every baby being born today is getting that first eye exam, is really
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.640]   just looking for that red reflex.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.960]   It's not typical, as long as that's looking good, to worry about getting an eye exam.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.400]   From there, kind of through childhood, like maybe early elementary school, unless your
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.820]   baby is presenting with one of a number of features that parents often pick up on.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.600]   For example, as the baby's aging through those first couple of years, you know, through the
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.960]   first couple of years, babies actually don't have great visual acuity.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.720]   And so as they're aging over those first couple of years, it's normal for them to have, you
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.440]   know, roving eye movements, for example, be searching their environment.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.040]   But over those first couple of years, if parents start noticing the baby isn't, you know, isn't
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.240]   making eye contact or looking where a sound is, certainly if they have what's called nystagmus,
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.920]   like these rapid flickering alternating eye movements, anything like that, of course,
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.260]   you're going to trigger an eye exam.
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.120]   But otherwise, most babies, other than their pediatrician doing that red reflex check when
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.780]   they're in for their regular well child checks, that's really all that's needed through that.
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.640]   When most kids get to elementary school age, there will often be, often done at the schools,
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.480]   an amblyopia screening exam.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.000]   If kids' eyes, either if one eye doesn't see that well, like maybe you're very nearsighted
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.360]   or farsighted in one eye and pretty normal sighted in the other, or the two refractive
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.080]   errors are quite different from each other, that can lead to a condition you've talked
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.100]   about on the podcast before called amblyopia, which is probably one of the more common or
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.360]   most common eye diseases of children.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.240]   Or if the eyes aren't aligned, you know, our eye muscles and the brain behind them are
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.560]   really responsible for keeping the two eyes looking straight ahead.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.400]   And if that's not working properly and one eye is off kilter and therefore the image
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.560]   of what we're looking at is falling on different spots of the retina, it's not syncing up right
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.000]   in the brain, that can lead to this disease condition called amblyopia where that eye
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.500]   is no longer talking to the brain properly.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.480]   And there's a pretty easy screening exam that can be done for strabismus, the misalignment
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.300]   of the eyes that kids will do in elementary school.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.640]   The other main presenting symptom of kids in elementary school is when they admit to
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.640]   their parents, I can't see the board or I can't see the teacher up front, and then they
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.160]   might be quite nearsighted.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.120]   And so that will also trigger an exam.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.120]   And so those are usually the parts for babies, for toddlers, for children, school aged children
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.200]   that might reasonably trigger an exam.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.240]   A couple of questions about early eye exams and we'll get onto eye exams in older individuals
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.240]   in a second.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.720]   But I want to interrupt you with this question.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.080]   So you mentioned that there can be a misalignment of the eyes.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.600]   I've seen many people's babies where there is one eyeball that seems to be kind of drifting
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.680]   around and then it might correct, but sometimes they'll have a, we don't want to get technical
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.880]   here for our listeners, we'll keep it general, but either convergent eyes or one eye converging
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.640]   cross eyes or wall-eyed, again, using that non-technical language here.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.940]   And my understanding is that the brain is taking that information in and is very plastic.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.360]   It's changing at these early stages of development and that it's fairly critical to get that
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.760]   stuff corrected early on, because if you wait too long, the brain can essentially become
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.980]   blind to the, or rather the brain cannot learn to handle the proper alignment.
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.840]   So in other words, if a kid has cross eyes, crossed eyes, excuse me, and they're not corrected
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.200]   until they're 20s, it's possible that they will never recover normal vision.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.720]   Whereas if you recover, if you align the eyes properly early in development, they can indeed
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   recover vision.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.640]   How early can and should one consider getting those eye realignments done?
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.640]   Pretty much right on.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.020]   What they'll do is if they detect any eye misalignment, and sometimes parents are good
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.880]   at noticing that, and sometimes you take a picture and one eye got the red eye reflex
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.640]   and the other one didn't, and sometimes people notice that their kid's eyes are sort of turning
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.900]   in, it seems like too much.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.640]   Sometimes there's what's called pseudostrabismus, which is where actually, depending on your
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.120]   anatomy, if you have a little extra skin sort of on the inside corners of your eyes, it
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.720]   makes your eyes look turned in when actually they're straight.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.080]   But if your eyes are actually turned in, or slightly less common in children, more common
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.360]   in adults, misalignment turned out, it's really important to correct that early.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.840]   And the reason is, as you were saying, the brain starts ignoring it.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:18.320]   It fails to fully develop the strong connections for the data coming in from one of those two
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.600]   eyes into the brain.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.480]   And if you pass certain sort of thresholds during development, during childhood, without
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:32.440]   correcting that connectivity, getting those two eyes to work together properly, you can
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.000]   permanently lose that.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.160]   And so we used to use very sort of gross numbers, like it's fully correctable if you can intervene
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.880]   before age three.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.600]   It's partly correctable if you can intervene before age six.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.280]   You got a chance before age nine.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.880]   But it turns out in follow-on studies that even kids into their young teens have a shot
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:02.880]   at correcting that eye-brain connection, that amblyopia, that loss of vision that can occur
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.620]   during early development.
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:11.160]   So even if you're only unfortunately detecting that later on in childhood, or even sort of
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:19.000]   the tween years, or early teen years, it's still worth a try to really push to retrain
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.520]   the weaker eye and then also realign the muscles so that they can work together to keep the
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.520]   eyes focused.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.800]   I'll tell you, it's interesting, and there's a lot more to learn about brain plasticity
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.480]   and probably a lot of really cool new therapies yet to discover that could reopen what's called
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.280]   critical period plasticity, this plasticity that we have during development that kind
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.640]   of goes away as we age.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.420]   And that critical period plasticity, as you know, has been the best studied actually in
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.280]   the visual system.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.280]   And the idea that we could reopen that is really fantastic.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:59.620]   But for different parts of that eye-brain connection, there's different periods for
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.000]   critical period plasticity.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.360]   For example, even if you get the amblyopic eye to see well again and then you realign
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:12.080]   the eyes and now they're working together, a lot of kids will never recover full depth
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.280]   perception, stereopsis, the use of two eyes to see depth, for example.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:23.800]   So why that part of the brain doesn't correct as well as the visual acuity or central vision
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.520]   part of the brain, I'm not sure if we understand that yet.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:34.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
