[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.880]   that section of scripture that we read at the beginning in the book of the Prophet Jeremiah
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.760]   in the second chapter and the thirteenth verse.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.560]   The thirteenth verse in the second chapter of the book of the Prophet Jeremiah, "For
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.520]   my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters,
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:38.720]   and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water."
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.880]   My people have committed two evils.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.920]   They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.720]   cisterns, that can hold no water.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.280]   This is one of the many statements which you must have noticed in the reading at the beginning
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.200]   which the Prophet Jeremiah makes in this the first message which he addressed to his recalcitrant
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.040]   and sinful fellow countrymen.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.600]   Jeremiah was a man called of God to address the nation of Israel at a time of great trouble
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.240]   and trial and perplexity.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.880]   Everything had gone wrong in almost every respect.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.080]   There had been a serious and a terrible moral declension.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.120]   There was trouble even in a military sense.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:45.000]   And indeed, their whole future was in jeopardy for these and other reasons.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.680]   And the Prophet is sent to them to address them, to call them to repent and to turn back
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.200]   to God.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.560]   And in this chapter, as I say, we have the first part, the beginning of his first address,
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.560]   his first message to them.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.720]   And in this, as you noticed, he analyzes the whole situation in a most thorough and searching
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.040]   manner.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.840]   But I'm calling attention in particular to this thirteenth verse tonight, because in
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:27.440]   this he seems to me, Adinorite, to put plainly and clearly the whole essence of the situation.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.760]   That is a characteristic of his method.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.600]   He deals with a lot of details, then he seems to sum it up and puts the whole case before
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.080]   us in a very succinct and clear and dramatic manner.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.160]   And I'm calling your attention to that, and I hope God willing to follow him also on subsequent
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:56.480]   Sunday evenings as he brings out his various points, his various parts of his analysis,
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:05.600]   knowing why these people were in such a terrible and indeed in such a tragic state.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.920]   Now here, of course, the main trouble essentially was that these people had turned their backs
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.240]   upon God and they were backsliding.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.520]   But that shouldn't make us feel that this has got no message in general for us or for
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:29.320]   the unbelieving world tonight, for the essence of sin is always the same.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:36.240]   Whether it is seen in an unbeliever or whether it is seen in a believer, sin is always essentially
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.240]   the same thing.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.720]   And what the Prophet says here, therefore, about the nature and the character of sin,
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.680]   as it was seen particularly in his own contemporaries, is as true tonight as it was then.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.720]   Now I need scarcely explain why I'm calling your attention to this.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:02.400]   Here I say is a Prophet addressing his people at a time of real calamity.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.160]   Things were going from bad to worse every month, every year.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.440]   And there was that great possibility of that Chaldean power, the power of Babylon, threatening
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.240]   the whole life of the nation, threatening to attack them, to destroy them, and to carry
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.640]   them away into captivity.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.040]   But the end has not yet come, it's not too late.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.600]   And God calls upon these people to awaken and to consider the situation and to repent
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.520]   ere it be too late.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.280]   I think the parallel is obvious, isn't it?
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.440]   The world is in a terrible state tonight.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.080]   The world is in awful trouble.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.920]   The world is a place of unhappiness.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.720]   The world is ill at ease.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.280]   The world is perplexed and bewildered and doesn't understand and doesn't know and
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.160]   doesn't realize what it ought to be doing.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.400]   Now this is the extraordinary thing.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.480]   The whole world tonight is seeking for satisfaction.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.560]   Nobody wants to be miserable.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.440]   Nobody really wants war.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.160]   Everybody's looking for peace, happiness, satisfaction.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.160]   Talk to any man you like, wherever you may find him, ask him what's he looking for,
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.440]   and everybody will tell you that they're looking for satisfaction in life, something
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.280]   worthwhile they say, peace, enjoyment, contentment.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.080]   That is the great quest of the whole of mankind.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.640]   Well then the question is, why is the world as it is tonight?
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.480]   Why are we the threat of war?
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.480]   Why is there discord, disunity?
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.840]   Why is there unhappiness?
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.520]   Why is there misery?
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.480]   Why is the world as it is and as we see it described in our newspapers day by day?
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.480]   What's the matter?
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.040]   Now that's the question.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.480]   That's precisely the question that is dealt with here by the Prophet Jeremiah.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.520]   For in effect what he says to them is this.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.600]   He says, "You know, there's no need for you to be like this.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.840]   You were not meant to be like this.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.120]   It's you yourselves who brought this upon yourselves."
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.640]   And therefore he says, "Listen, listen to what I'm telling you.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.240]   Ere it is too late, come back."
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.480]   And the same message is the message that is needed by this great world this evening.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.000]   I'm asking, why is the world as it is?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.040]   And the answer is given here.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.840]   It is always the same answer.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:37.720]   When will mankind wake up and learn this lesson and see the truth?
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.440]   Well what is it?
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.440]   Well here it is.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.840]   It's put like this.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.920]   We are all confronted in this world by two possibilities.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.200]   There are only two.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:57.520]   In our search for satisfaction, peace, rest, happiness, and enjoyment, we are all of us
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.600]   either going to that fountain or else we are going to make systems.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.920]   There is no other possibility.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.480]   It all comes down to this.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.880]   We are all seeking satisfaction tonight either from some system or other, or else we have
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:22.160]   been to what the prophet Isaiah calls the wells of salvation, this fountain of living
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:30.560]   waters, which Jeremiah describes to the people in the name of God, and which is nothing but
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.880]   another name for God himself.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.120]   Now the whole tragedy of the world is just this.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.680]   The world, like these children of Israel at this juncture, is being guilty of these two
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.680]   evils.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.120]   It's a double blunder.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.980]   It is a double folly.
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.720]   My people have committed two evils.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.440]   They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and have hewed out themselves systems,
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:00.280]   broken systems, that can hold no water.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:06.280]   You can't read this chapter without feeling how foolish were those children of Israel.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:11.240]   You can't read their story as it's depicted here in the pages of the Old Testament without
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.080]   always feeling that.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.440]   You know the last thing, the last word to be said about sin is that it is an unutterable
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.200]   folly.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.800]   The sinner is a fool apart from being anything else.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.240]   He's just a fool.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:31.920]   And what the prophet is here so anxious to do is to bring home to these people the unutterable
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.280]   folly of their position.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:42.120]   And he does it in this verse by holding before them these two, the only two, possibilities
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.040]   confronting men in this life and in this world.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.800]   We're either, I say, drawing from the fountain of living waters, or else we have made systems
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.560]   for ourselves and are failing to find satisfaction.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.600]   Now let me this evening, as hurriedly and as briefly as I can, hold these two things
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.000]   before you.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.040]   You see, this is the biblical method, isn't it?
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.800]   It's either this or that, always.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:14.760]   You're either a follower of Abel or a follower of Cain.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:20.160]   You either listen to God as he speaks to you and promises you blessing, or you hear his
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.320]   threat of cursing, Mount Ebal, Mount Gerizim.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.520]   It's always the one or the other.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.040]   We are either building tonight on the rock or else in the sand.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.880]   We are either entering into the straight gate and to the narrow way, or else we're going
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.880]   in through the wide gate and to the broad way.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:43.040]   We're either serving God or Mammon.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.800]   It all comes down to that.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.760]   There are no other possibilities.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.560]   In other words, it comes to this, we're either for God, with God, or else we're against it.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.640]   And there is no other category that's worthy of our consideration.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:00.000]   Now then, let's look at it as it's put before us by the prophet here in this most interesting
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.520]   and pictorial manner.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.040]   Let's look at that false way first.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.000]   "Here you are," he says, "you children of Israel, my fellow countrymen," he says, "you've
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.320]   been mad enough, you've been foolish enough, not only to turn away from God, but you've
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:21.280]   tried to make for yourselves systems, broken systems, that can hold no water."
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.760]   You notice his sarcasm.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.800]   Well, yes, he's anxious to ridicule the thing.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.280]   He's anxious to show how foolish it is.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.640]   God grant that in this service tonight we may begin to see something all of us and see
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.720]   it as we've never seen it before.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.680]   Of the unutterable folly, I say, of trying to live life apart from God and his blessing
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.680]   upon us.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.600]   It's summed up by this word, "systems."
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.000]   Systems.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   What's the characteristic of that kind of life?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.360]   Well, it's obvious from the picture, isn't it?
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:58.280]   A system, in contrast with a fountain, is man-made.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.440]   Men don't make fountains.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.440]   I mean, not imitation fountains, I mean the genuine natural fountains.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.160]   Men don't make them, they're there.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.720]   But men make systems.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.160]   And that is the emphasis, of course, which the prophet himself puts to this, "You've
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:19.480]   turned away from me and have hewed out systems for yourselves."
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.480]   That's another way of translating it.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:27.040]   They, he says, speaking more objectively, have hewed them, hewed for themselves out
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.040]   systems.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:35.000]   Now, of course, this is a tremendous principle, and it's not surprising that we must start
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   with this.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.440]   What does it mean?
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.840]   Well, let me put it in a more modern form.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.480]   We can put it like this.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:50.880]   All philosophies and theories and views concerning life and how we are to live, apart from what
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:59.360]   we have in this book called the Bible, are entirely the work of men.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:05.320]   They come entirely and exclusively from men.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.800]   And the simple truth about all who are not Christians in this world tonight is, just
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:20.480]   to say, that the ideas by which they are living are entirely their own ideas.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.920]   What I'm emphasizing is this, you see, that they have no authority.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.520]   They have no sanction whatsoever.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:37.040]   Men say, "Well, I don't believe in a God who allows infantile paralysis or spastic
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.120]   children or calamities."
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.440]   They say, "I don't believe in such a God."
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.760]   But what authority have they for saying that?
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.960]   On what grounds do they say that?
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.040]   The answer is, they have no grounds at all except their own opinions, their own ideas,
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.760]   and their own theories.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.560]   I don't care if you take the works of the greatest and the mightiest philosophers that
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.520]   have ever lived, they're still only men.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.480]   They've looked out at life, they've tried to analyze it, they've tried to understand
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.880]   it, and they give us the results of their meditations.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:18.880]   But when they've done so, we know that we've got nothing but opinions.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.000]   It's entirely human, it's men-produced.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.960]   Go to them and say, "What's your authority for saying this?"
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.280]   And all the men can say is, "Well, that's what I think."
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.560]   You say, "Well, is that an authority?"
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.680]   Well, somebody tells you he's got a great brain, you know, he's got a great mind, but
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.800]   you've got nothing further than that, and then you begin to examine his life and you
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.920]   see that he's a failure in many respects, so you haven't much respect for his great
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.960]   mind and his great brain.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.840]   But my friends, the point I'm trying to establish, and I want to leave it in its general form
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.760]   this evening, is this.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:58.760]   Do we realize that apart from this book, we have nothing but human speculation, human
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:06.120]   thought, human theorizing, human attempts to arrive at a knowledge of truth and of ultimate
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.120]   reality?
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:13.120]   There is nothing beyond men if we exclude this book and its teaching.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.600]   Now, this applies, you see, to men's views of God.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.280]   They have no basis, they have no sanction whatsoever.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.040]   When they say that the God of love cannot and doesn't do this, it's simply that they're
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.280]   saying it, nothing more.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.200]   And therefore, if you accept their teaching, you are simply basing yourself on pure speculation,
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.480]   mere theorizing about the being of God himself.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.240]   Then what about men?
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.480]   What about the nature of men?
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.400]   Take these modern views and theories of men, which are so constantly changing.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:57.960]   Men as a pure biological being, or men as a purely economic being, or men as the result
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.240]   of the interplay of certain great historical forces and factors.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:07.320]   These are the current notions about men and the being and the nature of men.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.360]   But again, they have no authority, they're only theories.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.360]   One man says this, the other man contradicts it, and they contradict themselves blatantly
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.360]   and obviously.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.040]   There are different theories and they all cancel out one another.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.800]   But the thing is about all of them, that they're but human, they're but natural, but they're
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.880]   but men groping and trying to find the truth about himself and his own nature.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.040]   And the same about life.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.040]   What is life?
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.480]   What's the purpose of life?
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.040]   What's the object of life?
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.280]   What are we doing in this world?
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:47.800]   Now you take all these views outside the biblical view, and again I say you have no authority
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.880]   at all for them except that men say so, somebody says this or that.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.440]   People say, "No, I don't believe in an afterlife, I don't believe that man's anything but an
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.440]   animal."
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.440]   And therefore you live in this world to gratify yourself, have a good time, eat, drink and
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.640]   be merry, enjoy yourself, do what you want to do, don't let anybody interfere with you,
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.320]   don't let anybody repress you, let yourself go, express yourself.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.840]   And they say that's the way to live, and many are adapting it and are doing it.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:16.040]   But my dear friend, what's your authority?
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.520]   What's the sanction for that view of life?
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.520]   There's nothing beyond men.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:25.200]   Men write it and say it, they say it with great confidence, but it's only a man like
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.400]   yourself, there's no real difference, and it's the same with death, you know.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.320]   They say dogmatically death is the end.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.320]   There's nothing after death.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:40.040]   "I don't believe," they say, "in an afterlife and another world, death is the end."
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.720]   Can they prove that?
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.540]   Can they demonstrate it?
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.540]   Can they establish it?
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.540]   Of course they can't.
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:52.040]   It's nothing but a theory, just a human opinion, and again there's great disagreement amongst
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.560]   them, but the point is that all of them are trusting to something that they've produced
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.000]   themselves, they've made a system.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.760]   All views and theories of life and men in all these relationships, apart from this,
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:12.320]   are, I say, entirely factitious and are made by men and men alone.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:17.040]   You've got nothing but supposition and theory and guesswork.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.800]   But wait a minute, let's look at another aspect.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:30.920]   Another characteristic of that system view of life and that system way of life is this.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.600]   It is always something that comes into being as the result of this effort which I've been
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.560]   describing on the part of men.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.640]   A man has to make it, you see, decides first of all how to make it, how long, how broad,
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.960]   how deep, where to put it, and so on and so forth, the supply and the exit.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.640]   It involves a great deal of effort, a great deal of striving on the part of men.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.760]   Of course, it's a man-made product.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:01.000]   And here is something which is so true of this non-Christian view and way of life this
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.600]   evening.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.240]   It leaves it all to you.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.320]   It has no help to give you apart from what you can do yourself.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.040]   It doesn't believe in the supernatural and the miraculous.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.240]   It doesn't believe in a God and a God who intervenes.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.960]   No, no, it says it's left to you.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.860]   So all it can do for you is to educate you, try and give you an example, try and give
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:27.120]   you a stimulus, try to help you on your way, but it's left all to you.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.320]   Your willpower, your understanding, your brains, your effort.
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.000]   You've got to live your own life yourself.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   It's a good life.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.240]   If you want to live a good life, well, you've got to do it.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.720]   It leaves it all to you, and all it can do is to give you a certain amount of help.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.720]   Think of the effort involved.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:53.240]   But above all, let us remember how it leaves it all in the end to us and with us ourselves.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.320]   Then another characteristic of the system is this one.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:02.000]   A system, of course, is always limited in its capacity.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.680]   A system, well, you can tell exactly the cubic capacity of a system.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:13.540]   You can measure, therefore, exactly the contents of a system, even when it is full.
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:19.080]   And here I see a great and a most important parable.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:24.960]   There is nothing to me which is so pathetic about the non-Christian view of life as its
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.680]   limited nature and character.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.600]   You can read it in your greatest philosophers.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.840]   You won't have read very far.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.760]   You won't have read them at all thoroughly.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.160]   Therefore, you find that they're all very limited.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.680]   Oh, they can deal very well with certain aspects of life.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:51.480]   But the moment you come to the great questions, to the profundities, they have to admit and
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.940]   to confess that they don't know.
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.680]   They don't understand.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.920]   That's the tragedy, I say, of all the non-Christian views that have afformed mankind this evening.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.360]   Let me ask it again.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.320]   What is the meaning of life itself?
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.960]   Go and ask your non-Christian thinkers.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:17.480]   Ask your non-Christian philosophers, the moderns and those who've lived in past ages.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.880]   And they don't know.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.560]   They really cannot tell you.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.560]   It eludes them.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.560]   It's beyond them.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.880]   They put up their theories, but they're not satisfactory, and they cancel one another
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.880]   out, as I'm saying.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.040]   Or look at it like this.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.280]   They're all so exclusively intellectual, also.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.760]   They know nothing about the feelings and the sensibilities.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:46.000]   These you see are things that can't be analyzed, they can't be docketed.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.400]   There is something subtle about them, and they don't understand them.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.160]   But they're very real in life, are they not?
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.360]   In other words, your human philosophies, your man-made ideas concerning men and his life
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:08.680]   in this world, are never able to account for our deepest and our most valued experiences.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.200]   We are living in a scientific age, aren't we?
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.800]   And they're trying to tell us that the whole of our lives should be scientific, that we
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:20.280]   must get rid of all these other aspects of life, and that our lives must be planned,
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.200]   they must be rational, they must be thought out.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.120]   We must be scientific, they say.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.280]   We've got all these discoveries, let's apply them to the whole of life.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.480]   They say man has been living in an irrational kind of manner.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.360]   Well now, his whole life must be systematized, and he must live according to his scientific
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.360]   knowledge.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.920]   Where do feelings come in?
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.640]   Where does love come in?
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:52.200]   Where do those feelings come in that I say you can't even describe at times?
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:58.680]   "Oh," says the poet to me, "the meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that too often
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.680]   lie too deep for tears."
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.520]   What does your scientist know about that?
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.720]   He knows nothing about it.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.920]   He doesn't understand it.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.280]   He can't account for that.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.320]   This is something to him irrational, and yet these are the profoundest things in life.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.160]   These are the things which make life life.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:21.080]   Love, this deep emotion, this something which you can't dissect and analyze, you're aware
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.640]   of it and you can't always give reasons for it, but there it is, one of the most moving,
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.720]   glorious experiences in life.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:33.760]   And so on with all these finest and highest sensibilities.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.760]   The system philosophies don't cater for that.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.280]   They know nothing about that.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:45.360]   Oh, I think I may have quoted here before that poem of Robert Browning which seems to
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.960]   me to put this so well, called Bishop Bloomgram's Apology.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.320]   It's the story of an old bishop having a conversation with a young man.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.320]   The young man was a student and very well educated and very knowledgeable and felt he
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.840]   understood everything.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.360]   And he has a talk with the old bishop.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.400]   The old bishop was very patient with him and very kind and said, "Yes, I know exactly what
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.400]   you feel.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.600]   I remember feeling that at your age."
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.720]   But he said, "You know, life has taught me certain things."
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.760]   He said, "I once had got a complete philosophy.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.440]   I thought I'd made my system.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.760]   In other words, I'd got my system, you see.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.840]   System of philosophy.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.960]   And everything went into that.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.360]   It fitted into this system that I'd made.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:34.720]   But you know," said the old bishop, "just when you're safest, there's a sunset touch,
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:41.560]   a fancy from a flower bell, a chorus ending from Euripides, someone's death.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:47.800]   And that's enough for fifty hopes and fears as old and new as nature's very self, the
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:52.120]   grand perhaps."
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.680]   The system was too small.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.840]   The cistern was not big enough.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:03.360]   It can't account for the immersion a man feels when he sees a flower or a sunset or hears
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.760]   of the death of a dear friend.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.240]   These things that really make life life, the finest, noblest things, they can't account
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   for them.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.240]   They don't come in.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.240]   They don't understand them.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:21.000]   They're doing their utmost to get rid of them and to make our life cold and narrow and scientific.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.120]   Oh, the narrowness and the limited capacity of the system.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.640]   And another thing that's characteristic of the cistern, of course, is that the water
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.440]   in a cistern is static.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.440]   There's no life there.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.440]   There it is.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.840]   You send in the given amount and there you've got it.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.840]   And there's no more.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.640]   If there suddenly comes an emergency, there's still no more.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:47.240]   It's a limited capacity.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.980]   There are no reserves in time of need.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:56.920]   But not only that, your water in the cistern, it tends to get hot, it tends to get stale,
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.120]   you tend to tire of it.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.680]   It doesn't refresh you.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.280]   Because it's static, I say.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.340]   Because it isn't living.
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.520]   Because it isn't bubbling up from the depths.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.080]   It hasn't got life in it.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.080]   No, no.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:12.760]   It's something static, feels the heat of the sun and doesn't know how to deal with
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:19.320]   it, hasn't got any depths of reserve, and thus becomes stale, flat, and insipid, and
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:23.400]   no longer can refresh you, especially when you need it most of all.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.200]   Those are the characteristics, then, of these cisterns that men make.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.400]   They've made to themselves cisterns.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:34.560]   And then the third point is, as we are reminded by the next word, broken cisterns.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:41.320]   And what a perfect picture this is of the prophets here.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.880]   You know, the trouble with these made cisterns is that they're always needing attention.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.240]   They always need to be patched up.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.240]   Why?
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.600]   Well, because they're broken.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.680]   You think you've made a watertight cistern, but you go to it and you'll find it isn't
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.680]   watertight.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.960]   The water's been leaking out in all directions, and there isn't enough there for you.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.400]   And what is there, as I say, is hot and stale, and perhaps a little bit muddy at the same
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.400]   time.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.400]   Why?
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:13.520]   Because these man-made cisterns are frail at their very best and at their very highest.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.520]   Everything man makes is frail.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:20.960]   He's a frail creature himself, and all his creations manifest this same frailty as he
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.440]   does himself.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.080]   But not only that, you see.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.040]   You make your cistern and you put it there in that position on the earth, well, there's
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.560]   something in the earth itself that affects it.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.120]   There's an interaction of the very ground and the chemicals in the ground upon the wood
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.560]   of your cistern or whatever material you've used in making it.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.480]   And rust comes in, and it begins to eat, and the holes begin to develop.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.600]   There are forces all round it in the earth.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:49.200]   The rain comes, there are movements of the earth, and the result is that your poor cistern
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:57.360]   becomes broken and you're constantly having to pay attention to it.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.720]   I mustn't keep you this evening.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:03.460]   I'm resisting the temptation to expand these points one by one.
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:07.240]   But if you take up any book which gives you the history of philosophy, do you know what
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.240]   you'll find?
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:13.140]   Well, you'll just see the mechanics trying to repair the broken cisterns.
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:18.780]   Somebody brings a masterpiece, here's at last the complete philosophy, but then a hole develops.
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:22.160]   Somebody comes along and finds a defect, and now then you've got to patch up that hole.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.040]   But the moment you've done that, there's another there.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.200]   And here are the philosophers patching up the holes, trying to stop them, but the water's
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.880]   going out the whole time.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.880]   Broken cisterns.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:36.320]   Oh, the very forces that are in life itself are too much, you see.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:41.920]   I always feel that one sinner smashes every human philosophy.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:46.640]   One man alone is enough to smash and to destroy every human philosophy.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.640]   Why?
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.920]   Well, because man is so incalculable.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.840]   They're always telling us what we ought to be and what we ought to do, but we are not
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.840]   that.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.360]   And when you think you've got your perfect society, everything goes wrong.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:01.000]   Now this century is a perfect proof of the very thing that the Prophet Jeremiah is saying.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.600]   Here we are in the twentieth century.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.640]   We really are now going to make a perfect world.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:09.520]   We fought the last war, the war to end war, from 1914 to 1918.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.520]   That's what we said.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.080]   Now then we've made a system, League of Nations.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.080]   Never another war.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.400]   It's really going to do it.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.920]   But we've had another war.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   Why?
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.000]   Well, you can't keep men in a system.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   You can't reduce men to a system.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.840]   You know, the man is too big for that.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.040]   Sin is too big for that.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.960]   It smashes all our systems.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.000]   Man may be all right with his mind, but there's something else in him.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.480]   He decides with his mind, there he's made a system.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:38.840]   And then he himself, obeying a lust, smashes it, and there's a hole in it.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.840]   Isn't that life?
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.840]   Broken systems?
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.520]   You see, we can't make them.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.640]   We are too frail.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.640]   We don't understand.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.720]   We are not big enough.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.800]   And this earth and this rain and all these movements of the chemical, all these things
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.120]   are affecting it.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.440]   And the rust, I say.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.280]   And thus our system is broken.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.760]   It's got holes in it.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:04.280]   But quite apart from all that, it always is getting older and older, isn't it?
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.560]   You made a wonderful system perhaps years ago.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.560]   What's it like now?
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.560]   It gets old.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.000]   It begins to decay.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.920]   It becomes out of date.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:21.960]   And so it is with all these theories and ideas and schemes of men.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.000]   How confident they are in every age.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.040]   How proud of them.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.880]   Little realizing that subsequent ages are going to look at their handiwork and patronize
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.840]   it and feel rather sorry for it.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:37.760]   They say, well, of course, considering their circumstances, they didn't do so badly.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.920]   But really it's rather funny, isn't it?
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.760]   Everything everybody's ever done until the 20th century, we feel rather sorry for them,
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.760]   don't we?
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.400]   Quite a good attempt, but of course they didn't know what we know.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.480]   And you know, if there is another century, it'll laugh at us in the same way.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.480]   Why?
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.720]   Because our system gets old.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.200]   It gets out of date.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.200]   We want something new.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.880]   There's an element of decay in it always.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.600]   Broken systems.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:08.480]   The best systems made by men are incapable of standing up to the stresses and the strains
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.880]   and the trials and the circumstances of life.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:18.000]   But let me end this examination of the false by putting this last point which he makes
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   here.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:28.520]   They have hewed them out systems, broken systems, that can hold no water.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.760]   That's the final trouble.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.680]   They can hold no water.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:42.140]   It's another way of saying that they do not and they cannot satisfy.
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:46.880]   They cannot meet and satisfy the needs of the soul.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.160]   Man has an awareness in him that he's but a stranger in this world.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.600]   We've all got it.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.520]   Whatever you may say with your head, you know it in your bones.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.680]   Man has a feeling that he was not meant for a life like this, that things were not meant
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.680]   to be like this.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:06.600]   He's got some yearning, some longing for an ample ether, a diviner air.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.480]   But he can't find it and these systems don't provide it.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:16.360]   The needs of the soul, they're not being met.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.960]   The needs of the soul for what?
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:22.400]   Well, the need of the soul for God.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:28.120]   Man has this feeling within himself that he's made for another and made by another.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.440]   He has a longing for some certainty, some absolute.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.760]   The philosophers have got it.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.640]   It's they who talk about the absolute.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:39.520]   It's their way of confessing that within them there is a sense of God, some supreme
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.400]   being, but they can't find him.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.560]   The world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.360]   Can man by searching find out God?
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.360]   He cannot.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.960]   He's always trying to, but he cannot.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:58.160]   And all his efforts fail to satisfy his need and his desire for God, for some security
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:03.400]   outside himself, some real knowledge of himself.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.480]   He can't find it.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.480]   What else does man seek for?
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.520]   He seeks for forgiveness.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.920]   He's got an evil conscience, a condemning conscience.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:21.160]   But the world doesn't help you and its philosophies don't help you.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:30.240]   As a poet has again put it, it leaves the world to misery and to me.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.840]   If you go wrong, the world won't help you very much.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.840]   It can't help you.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.840]   Why not?
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.020]   Well, because it all depends on human effort.
[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.400]   If you fail, well, they say you shouldn't have failed.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.880]   You should have pulled yourself together.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.880]   You should have exercised willpower.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.560]   Why didn't you do as I've done?
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:44.560]   It can't help you.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.200]   It's got nothing to offer you.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.640]   If you've broken down in life and have failed tonight, have you found that the world can
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.360]   help you?
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.800]   What has it got to give you?
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.960]   With its moralities, its philosophies, its social schemes and everything, what has it
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:02.640]   got to give a man who's conscious of failure and who needs forgiveness, who needs sympathy?
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.640]   It hasn't got it.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.040]   It can't give it.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:10.000]   They hold no water.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.280]   Has it any power to give you?
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:19.640]   When you become conscious of this moral failure or failure in any respect, and when you say,
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.640]   "What can I do?
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.640]   I've taken my resolutions.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.640]   I can't keep them.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.760]   I've resolved, but I break my resolves.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.760]   Can't I find help somewhere?
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.760]   Is there no strength?
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.920]   Is there no power available?"
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.920]   They can't give it to you.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.920]   They can't do it themselves.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.280]   They can talk about philosophy and goodness, beauty and truth, but look at their lives,
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.280]   so many of them.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.360]   No, no, it's sad.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.360]   There is no water there.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:43.680]   There is nothing to give a man satisfaction.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.840]   And I say it has no comfort to give.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.560]   And at the end, it has no hope to give.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:55.480]   As a man gets older and older, it gives him less and less.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.240]   It takes a young man to be excited about his philosophy.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.360]   As a man gets more and more experienced, he becomes doubtful.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.640]   He becomes uncertain.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.360]   He tends to become cynical.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.000]   And there he is as he gets older and older and his powers are failing and his mind is
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.760]   no longer functioning, to bendy about these great terms and these great contrasts and
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.800]   to be clever.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:19.280]   When he fails, he's got nothing.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.440]   He's got no hope for his old age.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.480]   He doesn't know how to face death.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.360]   He knows of nothing beyond it.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.360]   There's no water there.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.800]   They don't hold water.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.800]   There's no satisfaction.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:37.120]   These are the things we all need and shall need at some moment or other in our lives.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.560]   But they leave us helpless and hopeless without hope.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:45.240]   I know of nothing in the modern world that is quite so tragic.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:49.760]   I must say, forgive me for mentioning a person.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:55.880]   To me the greatest tragic sight in the world at this hour is an old man aged eighty-eight
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:59.840]   called Bertrand Russell.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.680]   Being prepared to incite men to civil disobedience.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.680]   What for?
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:09.280]   Oh, just to try to prolong life a little longer in this world.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.720]   Poor tragic philosopher.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:16.240]   Why does he do all this and even incite to civil disobedience to prolong life a little
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.240]   longer?
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.400]   Oh, I'll tell you why.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.880]   Because he has no hope whatsoever.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.080]   He knows nothing about the soul.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:29.160]   He knows nothing about life beyond the veil.
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:32.600]   He knows nothing about heaven and hell.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.720]   He's a materialist, you see.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.800]   His little cistern is so small and there's no water in it and there's no hope there.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.280]   So all he can do is to clutch and to hold on to it at eighty-eight.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:48.320]   Frantically, pathetically, tragically, the cisterns are broken and they hold no water.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:53.360]   And they leave a man at the end of his life without hope, as Paul puts it.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:36:00.360]   Without God in the world and nothing else.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.880]   There is the view of life that is described by the cistern.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.120]   "That's your trouble," says Jeremiah to his contemporaries.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.600]   "You've been trying to get water from broken cisterns and you can't.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.080]   That's why you are as you are.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.480]   But you know," he says, "that's only one half of your folly.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.480]   Look at the other half.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.480]   What's that?
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.800]   Well, that they have turned their backs upon the other.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.140]   My people have committed two evils.
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:25.680]   They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters."
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:31.560]   Oh, my dear friend, how glad I am that I can go on to this.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:37.200]   You know, life without God and without Christ is unutterably hopeless, isn't it?
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.800]   As the poor man who doesn't believe in God and Christ, any hope at this moment, with
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:45.000]   all that's happening in the world and in these conferences and all the threats of calamities
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.800]   coming, where is he?
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.320]   What has he got to fall back upon?
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.880]   Where is his hope, I say?
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.880]   He has none.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.840]   Oh, thank God, there is another view.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.800]   There is something else confronting you this evening.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.280]   It's called a fountain.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.560]   And look at the contrast.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.720]   Look at the glory of this.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:04.720]   What is true about it?
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.640]   Let me just note them for you.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:11.320]   This comes from God.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:17.760]   They have forsaken me, God.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.360]   What's my authority as I speak in this pulpit tonight?
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.600]   Am I here saying that having meditated and cogitated over the problems of life and my
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.240]   own personal problems, I have come to certain conclusions?
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.480]   My dear friend, that's not my position at all.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.880]   I am not voicing a single personal opinion.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:39.960]   I am simply opening to you and expanding to you the contents of this book which is called
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.960]   the Bible.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:41.960]   Where did this come from?
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:47.400]   Well, ask them who wrote it, and they'll tell you that they have received it of God.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:52.680]   No prophecy, says Peter, the apostle Peter, is of any private interpretation, but holy
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:58.840]   men of God spake as they were moved, carried along by the Holy Ghost.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.920]   None of these men says, "This is my idea."
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.240]   They all say the same thing.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.400]   They say, "The word of the Lord came unto me.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.640]   The burden of the Lord was given to me."
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:11.040]   This prophet, you read the story of Jeremiah, you'll find that at certain points he said,
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.960]   "I'm not going to speak another word."
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.760]   He says, "Every time I speak, I only make enemies for myself.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.360]   They hate me, they're maltreating me, they're going to kill me."
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.560]   He says, "I'm not going to speak any longer."
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:25.160]   But he says, "The word of the Lord came and was like fire in my bones, and I had to speak."
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.160]   He didn't want to.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.320]   It was God's word, not his word.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.440]   Jeremiah didn't want to be unpopular.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.280]   Who does want to be unpopular?
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.480]   Why did he speak like this?
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:37.120]   Oh, God had given him a message.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.360]   My dear friend, don't you see the choice that is before you?
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:47.760]   In all your views of self and of life and of God and of death and of eternity, are you
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.960]   really going to base it all upon human theories and suppositions?
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:59.000]   Aren't you rather going to listen to this revelation from the living God himself?
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.640]   That's what we have here.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.680]   This isn't human speculation.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.880]   Read your Old Testament.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.880]   God speaking.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.880]   God called a man whose name was Abram and turned him into a nation, called him Abraham.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.880]   Why?
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:18.080]   Well, he wanted to address the world through this nation that would come out of this man.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:22.640]   And then, you see, a man arose in that nation called Moses, and God called him up to a mountain.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.000]   He said, "Go and tell the people this."
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.640]   He gave them ten commandments, the moral law.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.160]   That's how people are to live, says God.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.960]   If only they do that, I'll bless them.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.640]   Now this is, you see, a divine view.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.240]   It's divine sanction.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.040]   I mustn't keep you.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:44.520]   "Powering over above your Abrams, your Moses, your Aarons, your mighty succession of prophets
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:53.560]   to Israel, stands one alone, Jesus of Nazareth."
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.560]   Son of God.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.760]   This is no man only.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.720]   This one hasn't come by natural birth or generation.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:07.320]   This is incarnation, God the Son entering into time, coming what for?
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.840]   To reveal God, as John puts it in the prologue of his Gospel.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.920]   "No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.400]   The only begotten was in the bosom of the Father.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.320]   He hath declared Him."
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:21.960]   My dear friend, isn't it about time you began to listen to Jesus Christ?
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.120]   Stop listening to men.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:29.320]   Any men, listen to this one who stands alone, Jesus of Nazareth, a prophet mighty in word
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:35.320]   and deed, one who was crucified, buried, but who rose again, triumphant even over the grave.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.320]   Listen to Him.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.320]   He is speaking.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:41.120]   That's the alternative.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:47.200]   Not the vaporizing and theories of men, but the authoritative Word of God.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:53.400]   "Man doth not live," He says, "by bread alone, but by every word proceeding out of the mouth
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.520]   of God."
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.600]   The authority of God Himself.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:01.280]   Just let me hurry on to tell you something about the characteristics of the fountain.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.400]   Oh, what a contrast.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.400]   What a perfect picture.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.040]   Look at that man sweating there to make his cistern.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.040]   Look at the fountain.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:15.880]   There it is, you see, and it's always been there, bubbling up.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.880]   All you do is to take your little can or whatever it is and fill up out of the fountain.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.400]   There it was.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.120]   You did nothing about it.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.520]   You perhaps didn't know of its existence.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.000]   Somebody told you, and you went up and there you saw it, the fountain.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.560]   Oh, you didn't have to make it.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.160]   It was made before you.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.400]   Oh, that's Paul's.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.320]   This is Paul's gospel, this you see, in Jeremiah.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.760]   By grace it is said.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.160]   No man makes himself a Christian.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.000]   Thank God, no.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.400]   Thank God my hope in life tonight doesn't depend upon me and my willpower or my feeble
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.400]   efforts.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.460]   Do you know the first thing this gospel announces is this?
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.240]   We are His workmanship.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:42:00.320]   Without our own make and creation, we are His workmanship, created anew in Christ Jesus.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:05.240]   My dear friend, why don't you listen to a gospel that does things to you, does things
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:09.160]   in you, does things for you, the greatest things of all?
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.160]   The fountain.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.800]   There it is.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.720]   You've done nothing about its production.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:18.400]   It was there confronting you, offering its water to you.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.400]   That's Christianity.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.240]   That's the gospel.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.320]   And then, you know, think of this other point in contrast to the system.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.040]   I said that was very limited in capacity.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.760]   There's nothing more wonderful about a fountain than this, its depths.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.760]   How deep down does it go?
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.760]   Nobody knows.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.920]   It seems to be coming up from the bowels of the earth.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.280]   Oh, the depth of the fountain.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.960]   Listen to the apostle Paul saying that in his own way.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:45.000]   Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the knowledge and the wisdom of God.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.880]   How unsearchable is his wisdom and his ways past finding out?
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.880]   Depth!
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:59.600]   You know, says Paul again in writing to those Ephesians, he says, "It's a wonderful
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.480]   thing God has called me.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.040]   He gave me a revelation.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.200]   He laid his hand upon me.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.840]   He's committed to me a dispensation of the gospel."
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.840]   What is it?
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:15.960]   He says, "It is that I might preach amongst the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of God."
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:16.960]   Unsearchable.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.600]   You can't get to the bottom of it.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.200]   You can very soon get to the bottom of your system, can't you?
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.200]   Limited, you see.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:29.040]   Length, breadth, height, multiply them together, cubic capacity, there it is, no more.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.040]   Can you do that with a fountain?
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.040]   Of course you can't.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.040]   It goes down.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:38.480]   It has resources all the depths of the riches of the wisdom and the knowledge, unsearchable
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:44.480]   riches of Christ, that he might be filled, he says, with all the fullness of God.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:49.120]   Yes, says the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, how shall we escape if we neglect
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.120]   so great salvation?
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.880]   There is no end to this.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.680]   There is an end to every human perfection.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.560]   There is an end to every human philosophy.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.800]   But you know, my friend, there is no end to this gospel.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.800]   I have been preaching this gospel now, you know, for thirty-three years, and I feel I
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.200]   am only at the beginning of it.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.600]   It is much easier to preach now than it was thirty-three years ago.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.120]   Why will I see more and more in it?
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.120]   There is no end to it.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:19.360]   It goes on and on and down and down, all the depths of the riches.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:26.640]   Thank God I am drawing out of a fountain and out of some man-made system.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.760]   And then another obvious contrast.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.760]   That water, I say, gets stale and flat and hot.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.760]   Ah, but the fountain!
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:39.440]   Have you ever been to a fountain on a hot day when you have been walking, and you are
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.440]   tired and weary, and you do not know what to do?
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:47.400]   And suddenly you come to a fountain, and you get down on your knees, and you just put your
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:51.960]   face into it, and your lips, and the coolness, and the refreshing quality.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.560]   Oh, how wonderful it is in spite of the heat and the drought.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.720]   It comes, you see, from the depths.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.360]   And there it is in all its pristine purity and coolness and strength.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.520]   Yes, the old, old story.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.600]   It is ever new, and it is ever true.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:12.680]   Though it has been running all these centuries, it is as fresh as ever, and as lively as ever,
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:14.480]   and as life-giving as ever.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:21.600]   How can anybody be fool enough to go and make a system and try and satisfy his needs when
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:27.960]   here is this bubbling water, the water, the well, the fountain of God himself?
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.120]   And let me hurry to my next contrast.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:34.640]   That I say is a broken system, and it is getting old, and it is breaking more and more.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:35.640]   This is permanent.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   There it is.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.640]   There it has been.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.640]   It is changing.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.640]   Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and today and forever.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:49.880]   Ah, but you say, look at the changes that have taken place in history, and in men and
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.880]   in his knowledge.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.280]   You are well aware of them all, you know.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.840]   But I do know at the same time that the needs of men are unchangeable.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.840]   The things I have been talking about, the need of forgiveness, the need of moral strength
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:02.000]   and power, the need to be able to resist, and you cannot find it there.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.080]   But here is something unchangeable.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:08.360]   There is no need of anything different.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.120]   There is no need to improve it.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.600]   There has never been a hole in it.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.680]   It has stood the test of the centuries, not of a few years.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:22.000]   Do you know, read your Bible, my friend, the moment Jesus Christ was born, the attack upon
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   him began.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Herod the king tried to kill him.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   He did not succeed.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.440]   The Pharisees and scribes and Herodians and Sardis, they tried to make holes.
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.440]   They could not.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.160]   He could answer everybody, even at the age of twelve.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.400]   He could conquer all the masters in debate.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.400]   They tried him.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.400]   They tried to condemn him.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.400]   Nobody could bring a charge against him.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.400]   He was faultless and guiltless.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   Ah, but you say they killed him.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.400]   They have got him at last.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.400]   No, they have not.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.400]   He rose again.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:46.920]   Never a hole, never a break, never any defect in every respect.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.920]   He stood.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.920]   He did everything.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:53.960]   He could look at his father at the end and say, "Father, it is finished."
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:54.960]   It was.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.960]   Nothing was left.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:56.960]   Nothing incomplete.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.760]   There he was at the beginning.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:04.160]   And you know, ever since they have been trying to find holes in this fountain of living water,
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.440]   the critics began.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.440]   The Jews did it.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.440]   The Greeks did it.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.440]   They did their utmost, but they failed.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.440]   Christianity triumphed.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.800]   It has continued throughout the centuries.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:16.160]   It has been going on the last hundred years.
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:20.880]   But this will end as all the others have ended, as the enlightenment of the eighteenth century
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.880]   ended.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:28.360]   This is a kingdom which cannot be moved.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:34.560]   This is a fountain in which there will never be a defect nor a blemish.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.560]   It is permanent.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.760]   It is everlasting.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:41.400]   And though men have taken of it by the thousand, it is still there, and it is still as full
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.400]   as ever.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.900]   A never-ebbing sea.
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:49.080]   The grace of God in Jesus Christ.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:54.080]   And lastly, it is fully satisfying.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:58.720]   They have hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.560]   Oh, the tragedy and the folly.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:08.160]   They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.160]   What's this?
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:14.640]   Oh, this is everything a man needs.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.760]   Do you need forgiveness?
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.360]   Of course you do.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.360]   Where can you find it?
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.920]   How do you answer an accusing conscience?
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.840]   How do you lie in your deathbed without fear?
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:23.840]   Tell me, how can you do it?
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.080]   Who can help you?
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.080]   Nobody can help you.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:30.520]   There is only one.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:36.600]   You will only know forgiveness as you go and look at this Jesus, Son of God, dying on the
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.440]   cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:46.360]   And there you will know that he was by bearing your sins in his own body on the tree, taking
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.840]   the punishment that you deserve, dying your death.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.880]   And because of that you are offered free forgiveness.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:55.480]   It's the only place in God's universe where you'll ever find it.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.200]   You've got to come to this fountain.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.880]   It's nowhere else.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:02.360]   Forgiveness, peace with God.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:07.280]   When God seems a terror to you, and his holy law is flashing upon you, and his ten commandments
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:12.280]   are condemning you, and the prophets and Christ and the teaching are all against you, what
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.280]   can you do?
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.000]   Where can you find peace with God?
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   It's only here.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.240]   God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.800]   them.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:24.800]   You need power.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.440]   Of course you need power.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:33.160]   And the only place where you'll find this power is in the same old fountain.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.160]   Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.640]   We are strong in him.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.840]   Whereas we were weak, he makes us strong.
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.040]   Whereas I was blind, now I see.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.520]   Whereas I was hopeless, he fills me with hope.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.520]   He gives me power.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:50.960]   Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.800]   It's the only way, the only hope.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:57.280]   Knowledge of God.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.760]   Nobody else can bring you to God.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.760]   He said so.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.600]   "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.400]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.280]   But you know, my dear friend, however weak and ignorant we may be, however illiterate
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:14.400]   and unphilosophical, if you go to him, he'll bring you to a knowledge of God, not a knowledge
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.840]   about him and make you clever.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.920]   He'll bring you to know God.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:28.440]   And as your Father, he'll give you life.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:31.760]   He'll give you comfort.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:35.880]   They shall still bring forth fruit in old age.
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:39.880]   They shall be fat and flourishing.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.320]   He has said, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee."
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:48.040]   And when you do get old and your powers fail, he won't turn his back upon you.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.280]   When you can't think, you'll feel him near to you.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.640]   You'll feel his presence.
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:54.280]   You'll know something about the unfolding of his arms.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.760]   He'll never leave you, neither in life, never in death.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:05.440]   Everywhere, always, he has said, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee."
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:09.360]   Not only that, he'll be with you in the river of death.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:14.480]   He'll take you through safely, and he'll take you to the other side.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:17.800]   He will tell you in this world of a blessed hope.
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:22.000]   He turned to his disciples as he turns to you tonight and says, "Let not your heart
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.040]   be troubled.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.360]   You believe in God.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.720]   Believe also in me.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:28.160]   In my Father's house are many mansions.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:31.120]   Let them send off their atomic bombs altogether.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:33.440]   In my Father's house are many mansions.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.600]   If it were not so, I would have told you.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:40.160]   I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:46.400]   again and receive you unto myself, that where I am there ye may be also."
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:52.920]   He is preparing for us an inheritance which is incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:59.880]   not away, reserved in heaven by God for those who believe in him.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:02.440]   That's what the fountain does.
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:05.440]   It's a fountain of living waters.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.560]   It never has failed.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.400]   It never will fail.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:12.920]   It will satisfy your every need.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:16.800]   My friend, you've given me the privilege of holding the two positions before you this
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:17.800]   evening.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:23.200]   Man-made systems, the fountain of God.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:27.160]   You've seen the truth about them.
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:36.840]   Can you continue, if you have hitherto, in the unutterable, indescribable folly of choosing
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:44.720]   these broken systems which don't hold water and rejecting the fountain of living water,
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:45.720]   God himself?
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.720]   I can't believe it.
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:55.000]   Oh, come, say with me now, as a man once put it, "I tried the broken systems, Lord, but
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.520]   ah, their waters failed.
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:05.920]   Even as I stooped to drink, they fled and mocked me as I wailed."
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:09.520]   Haven't you known something about that?
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:14.880]   These broken systems, their waters fail, and even as you stoop to drink of them, they fly
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:20.760]   away from you, they disappear, and they mock you as you wail in your thirst and your agony.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:25.480]   The world laughs at you and does nothing to give you and leaves you as those people left
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:29.080]   Judas when he'd betrayed our Lord and was sorry for it.
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.960]   They said, "That's your business, not ours.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:31.960]   Get on with it."
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:40.240]   The world will leave you on some scrap heap and will mock you, even as it fails you.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.560]   Are you ready to say that?
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:48.200]   Well, if you are, turn to the other side and say this, "Oh, Christ, in thee my soul hath
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:56.320]   found and found in thee alone the peace, the joy I sought so long, the bliss, till now
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:57.320]   unknown.
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:04.640]   Now none but Christ can satisfy, none other name for me.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:10.000]   There's life, there's health, there's lasting joy.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:17.080]   Lord Jesus, found in thee."
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.160]   Go to him and say that.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:23.600]   Or do you prefer to put it in the language of Horatius Bonner?
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:30.480]   "I heard the voice of Jesus say, 'Come unto me and rest.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:36.040]   Lay down, thou weary one, lay down thy head upon my breast.'
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:42.000]   I came to Jesus as I was, weary and worn and sad.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.960]   I found in him a resting place, and he has made me glad."
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.400]   Go to him in your weariness.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:48.400]   Try him.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.400]   You'll say the same thing.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.080]   Or go on saying it.
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:57.480]   "I heard the voice of Jesus say, 'Behold, I freely give the living water.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:02.680]   Thirsty one, stoop down and drink and live.'
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:07.000]   I came to Jesus and I drank of that life-giving stream.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:13.880]   My thirst was quenched, my soul revived, and now I live in him."
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.880]   Go on.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:20.200]   "I heard the voice of Jesus say, 'I am this dark world's light.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:22.520]   Look unto me.
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:28.320]   Thy dawn shall lighten, and all thy days be bright.'
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:35.840]   I looked to Jesus and I found in him my star, my sun.
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:41.480]   In that light of life I'll walk till travelling days be done."
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:42.480]   That's their testimony.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:46.600]   The men, you see, who've looked at the two, who've tried the broken cisterns and found
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:50.000]   them to fail, then they've come to him, the fountain of living waters.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   That's their testimony.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.560]   Let me add one more as I leave you.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:53.560]   Charles Wesley.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:57.560]   He knows what it is to try the others.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:00.560]   He knows what it is to be buffeted by the storms of life.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:01.560]   But this is his conclusion.
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:04.560]   "Thou, O Christ, art all I want.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.560]   More than all in thee I find.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:16.560]   Raise the fallen, heal the sick, lead the blind.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:21.560]   Plenteous grace in thee is found, grace to cover all my sin.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:23.240]   Let the healing streams abound.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:25.560]   Make me, keep me, pure within.
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:29.560]   Thou of life, the fountain of it.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:32.560]   Freely let me take of thee.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:35.560]   Spring thou up within my heart.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:38.560]   Rise to all eternity."
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.560]   Are you sad?
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:40.560]   Are you weary?
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:41.560]   Are you tired?
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:42.560]   Are you a failure?
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:43.560]   Are you forlorn?
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:44.560]   Are you condemning yourself?
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.560]   Do you feel hopeless?
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:49.560]   Do you feel the world has failed you, that you've got nothing?
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:53.560]   Are you afraid of the moment of the future, just as you are?
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:57:03.560]   Come to him, the fountain of living waters, and you will find this plenteous grace.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:06.560]   Christ is the fountain of life.
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:07.560]   Come to him.
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:10.560]   He'll give you life, and you'll never fail.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.560]   Amen.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:16.560]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
