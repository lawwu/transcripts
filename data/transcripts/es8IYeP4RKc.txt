[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380]   [music]
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.060]   Happy Wednesday, and thank you for listening to the podcast.
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.820]   Last time we were together on Monday, we took some time to look at several judgment texts
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.880]   in the New Testament to answer a sharp Bible question.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.100]   And one of the points Pastor John made on Monday caught my attention, it may have caught
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.960]   your attention too.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.160]   It was how Jesus described judgment in John 3:19.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.200]   And this is the judgment, Jesus said.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.540]   The light has come into the world and people loved the darkness rather than the light because
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.760]   their works were evil.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.960]   As Pastor John said on Monday, it's the world's love of the darkness that judges them in the
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.960]   end.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.800]   I want to press into this point, press deeper into this text and go back to John Piper's
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.880]   sermon on this text, preached back in 2009.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.920]   With that, here's Pastor John.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.600]   So verse 19 says, "There is a kind of judgment."
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.280]   How so?
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.280]   How so?
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.640]   How is it that when light, this light comes into the world, judgment happens?
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.360]   How is that?
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.960]   The rest of the text explains.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.300]   This is, let's read it again.
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.040]   This is the judgment that light has come into the world and, and here's what happens, here's
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.800]   the, here's the split.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.720]   People loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.560]   For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light lest
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.400]   his works should be exposed.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.400]   Stop.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.600]   Now that's the negative response.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.600]   Verse 21 is going to be the positive.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.360]   So let's just stay with the negative a minute.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.480]   Let's know ourselves and who we are, fallen under the wrath of God, under condemnation.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.240]   If you're an unbeliever, that's where you still are.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.960]   If you're a believer, you're still contaminated by it and need to constantly own your true
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.240]   identity in Christ and put to death the old identity.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.720]   So let's know ourselves here, believer or unbeliever, let's know ourselves.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.520]   You can sum up what I just read about this person in five steps.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.680]   Number one, we'll go from the bottom to the top.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.560]   Number one, their works, our works, works, what we think, we feel, we do, all that stuff
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.000]   is evil.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Verse 20 at the beginning of the verse, I mean it says so at the end of verse 19, their
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   works were evil.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.560]   And verse 20 at the beginning, they do wicked things.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.240]   Number two, they don't want this to be exposed.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.640]   What we're thinking, what we're feeling, what we're doing, my whole life of evil, I don't
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.440]   want that to be exposed.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.560]   So verse 20 at the end, lest his works should be exposed.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.360]   He doesn't want that to happen.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.040]   So first there's evil, and then there's the fear and the desire that it not be exposed.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.960]   Number three, therefore, they love darkness.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.480]   It's safe.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.760]   Verse 20 in the middle of the verse, look at it, and people loved the darkness rather
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.760]   than the light.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   This is a love affair.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.560]   Unbelief is at root a love affair.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.720]   Love is a big word.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.440]   He did not have to speak this way.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.120]   He could have stuck with belief language.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.920]   We all tend to think, "Oh, believing in Jesus is a decision."
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.800]   Well, sort of.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.640]   I mean, underneath decisions are torrents of reality.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.360]   And this is a description of them.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.280]   There's love going on down there for all wrong things.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.600]   Darkness, I love you, darkness.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.160]   I love you, darkness.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.520]   You are so safe.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.520]   You love me so much.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.480]   You protect me.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.040]   Number four, and therefore, they hated the light.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:06.120]   Verse 20 at the beginning, everyone who does wicked things hates the light.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.880]   He got to.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.360]   He got to.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:18.200]   All that stuff is going to look so horrible and shameful, and I can't stand that thought.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.360]   I just got to keep loving the dark and pushing the light away.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.120]   And so number five, they don't come to Jesus.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.920]   They don't come to the light.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.920]   Middle of verse 20, "And does not come to the light."
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.840]   So there they are, five steps.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.600]   One, I'm doing evil stuff inside, outside, I'm evil.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.400]   Number two, I don't want that to be exposed.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.140]   Number three, therefore, I love darkness.
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.660]   Number four, therefore, I hate the light.
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.040]   Number five, I'm not coming.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.120]   I'm not coming.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.080]   I'm not believing.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.080]   Believing and coming.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.280]   And John, same thing.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.000]   So this is Jesus' explanation of unbelief.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Remember that.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.200]   The division into two kinds of people, verses 19 to 21.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.080]   Same division as verses 16 to 18.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.320]   Some believe, some don't believe, and now he's going into the inner workings of our
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.320]   soul.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.840]   So let's just linger here for a minute.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.840]   I'm a sinner.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.320]   You're a sinner.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:25.140]   What I mean by that is my life is never fully in sync with the infinite worth and beauty
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.440]   of God.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.760]   Never.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.000]   Never fully in sync with the beauty and the worth of God.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.380]   God is always worthy of more than I give Him.
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.360]   He's always worthy of more intensity than I feel for Him.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.720]   Always worthy of more consistency of obedience than I give Him.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.680]   Always worthy of more consistent mental work for Him than I give Him.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.840]   Love the Lord your God with all your heart and soul and strength and mind.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.840]   Who does that?
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.440]   Raise your hand if you do that.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.440]   All of it.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.440]   All at all times.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.440]   Nobody.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.440]   Because you don't, and I don't either.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.440]   We're sinners.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.360]   And therefore we're under wrath because God is so infinitely worthy of more than we give
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.120]   Him and we dishonor Him every day of our lives, believer and unbeliever.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.120]   We do this.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.640]   And the difference is not that one is good and the other is bad.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.640]   Simply.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.800]   The Holy Spirit's at work on believers.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.560]   They are changing.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.920]   But I've been a Christian for, since I was six, I'm 63.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:34.360]   I'm not optimistic about finishing without sin.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.000]   I hope my sights are not too low.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.960]   I just love grace more.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.480]   A lot.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:51.680]   Jesus says now that we dishonor the Lord every day and the reason that people hate the light
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.320]   and love the darkness is this.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:06.360]   When by some amazing work of providence we begin to know ourselves sinful, it becomes
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:18.160]   either really angry making or really fear making that that might be exposed.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:25.240]   Just imagine your whole life and all you did last week and all the weeks before.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.720]   Just out there.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.040]   Just out there.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.240]   This is why people don't come to Christ.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.520]   This text says, "lest their deeds should be exposed."
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.000]   Shame that is deserved is a horrible thing.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.440]   You ever been embarrassed to the point of just wanting to run out of the universe as
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.440]   a little kid?
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.720]   Wetting your pants at school?
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.520]   I mean that's nothing.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.080]   What if everything were laid bare?
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.920]   This is why people don't come.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:09.720]   It's just terrifying that I might actually have to live in absolute light.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.000]   Nothing hidden anymore.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.780]   They don't come.
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.040]   They stay hidden.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.280]   Now careful.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:26.000]   That does not mean people don't commit public sins.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.880]   You might draw the conclusion from what I just said, "Oh people are afraid that their
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.320]   sin will be exposed so they never do it in public."
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:38.320]   What?
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.320]   Why?
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.520]   Why?
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:51.840]   If it's so terrifying to come into the light with your sin, why are sins so publicly flaunted
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840]   in our day?
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.760]   There's a real simple reason.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:04.560]   As long as the public banishes the light, there are enough people to admire the sinful
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.800]   behavior that you don't feel shame but approval.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:17.200]   As long as the light of Christ is kept out of the sphere in which you're acting out your
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:26.320]   evil, public sin is in the dark.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.160]   Public doesn't mean light.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:37.840]   Public means dark people observing dark behavior and liking it because it confirms their own.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:50.440]   But if God shows up, we call this revival, moving on a people in a church or in a community
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:57.640]   and suddenly Christ and all of his standards, the holiness of God and all of its perfection
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:05.360]   begins to rest with some weight upon the world, you know what happens?
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:11.060]   People are either driven to Christ because of the horror of their own shame or they're
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:19.680]   driven away further into darkness and the ways divide and that's the judgment that this
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.520]   verse is talking about.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.000]   Sobering and vivid.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.860]   This clip was taken from a sermon on John 3, 16 to 21, titled "This is the Judgment.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.920]   Light has come into the world," preached on May 17, 2009.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.760]   The whole thing is available in audio and in video at DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.400]   If you have a sermon clip to share, email me.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.800]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip happens in
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.920]   the audio and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.680]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email and send it to me at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:59.000]   That's my email address, AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.060]   Well faith and hope, we need both of them, faith and hope, but what exactly is the difference
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.040]   between them, between faith and hope?
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.040]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.360]   We are rejoined in studio with Pastor John for that when we return on Friday.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:12.860]   We'll see you then.
