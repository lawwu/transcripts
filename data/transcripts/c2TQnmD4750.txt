[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.280]   Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.560]   We tend to think of our pursuit of joy as a fundamental right, perhaps.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.680]   But it is certainly fundamental to our nature.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.880]   We are by nature, created nature, not fallen nature, pleasure seekers.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.280]   We want to be happy.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.560]   And we are also chronic failures when it comes to finding the kind of joy that will last
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.080]   for more than a fleeting moment.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:54.280]   What if the deepest joy that we seek really can't be found at all?
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:02.080]   What if the deepest and most durable happiness we could ever possess is a kind of joy that
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.280]   breaks into our lives and overcomes all our boredoms and ultimately finds us?
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:17.440]   What if the truest and deepest and most lasting joy is actually out of our reach, but somehow
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.680]   reaches back for us?
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.200]   Here at Desiring God, we ask serious questions about happiness.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.040]   We don't think there is anything more important for a human soul than being found by eternal
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.260]   joy.
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:44.480]   We ask very serious questions about joy, and we seek solid answers in the Bible.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.440]   That's the purpose of our new book.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.960]   The title is "The Joy Project, A True Story of Inescapable Happiness."
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.800]   The Joy Project pursues these serious questions about joy through a story, through the unrivaled
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.600]   narrative of God's plan for our joy.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.520]   The story begins and ends with God.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.680]   From all eternity, before all time, God was alive with volcanic joy.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:25.240]   Joy is essential to the very nature of God in the fellowship of the infinitely happy
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.800]   Holy Trinity.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.960]   The Father loves the Son and finds Him supremely well-pleasing.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.960]   The Son loves the Father and delights in all that He is.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:46.360]   The Holy Spirit streams omnipotently with His joy between the Father and the Son.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.300]   So God needs nothing.
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:03:00.560]   He has no deficiencies, and He is free from all evil, therefore, and full of all good.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.720]   So what does God's eternal, unbounded, overflowing joy mean for me?
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.520]   For you?
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.320]   It means I am not a pawn on the chessboard of a needy God.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:26.720]   Rather, He created me not because He needs me to make up for some deficit that He has,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:35.200]   but because He delights for His creatures to share the joy that He has in Himself.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.980]   We don't stumble onto this joy.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.360]   It pursues us.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.860]   It finds us.
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:54.000]   It is the amazing outcome of God's astonishing plan to pull us into His own joy forever.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.840]   The Joy Project takes us into the most profound story in the universe, retold in a short book
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.360]   by Tony Reinke, one of our writers at Desiring God, a very thoughtful and skilled writer,
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.880]   a writer you can trust and enjoy.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.400]   You can download the whole book free of charge in three digital formats.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.840]   Go to DesiringGod.org/TheJoyProject.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.080]   I hope you'll read it.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.760]   I hope you will rejoice in it.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.920]   The Joy Project, a true story of inescapable happiness.
