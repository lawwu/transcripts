[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.440]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter in the seventeenth verse. The seventeenth
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:20.560]   verse in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John. For the law was given by Moses,
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.920]   but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. For the law was given by Moses, but grace
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:36.400]   and truth came by Jesus Christ. We are continuing our study of this most important and crucial
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:44.280]   verse because, as I have been trying to explain and to expound, it gives us a kind of key
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.320]   not only to the understanding of this prologue of the Gospel according to St. John, but gives
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.440]   us an understanding in a sense of the whole of the Christian Gospel, the Christian life
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.000]   and the Christian outlook. That is why we are dealing with it. The greatest trouble
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   with all of us and with the whole world this morning is our failure to realize what God
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   has done for us in and through his dear Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. That is
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.560]   what the Christian Church is about. It is about him. It is not here to talk about men.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.480]   It is here to talk about the Son of God who has made men for us men and for our salvation.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.320]   So the Christian Church, when she behaves as the Christian Church, even on a remembrance
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.960]   day such as this, does not talk about men. She talks about God. She talks about the Son
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.960]   of God. We can only appreciate men truly as we look at them in the light of God and his
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.200]   most holy law. We have been saying that as we have been examining this great verse. "Father
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.800]   men are our neighbors. We will never know them truly until we know ourselves. We are
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.840]   to love our neighbor as ourselves. And we will never know ourselves as we have seen
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.320]   until we look at ourselves in the light and in the sight of God and in the light of his
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.900]   most holy law." Well, he gave this law through Moses. He had already put it into the heart
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.040]   of men when he made it. But because of men's fall and sin and rebellion, men had forgotten
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.800]   the law and had wandered away from the law. So God explicitly gave it again through Moses
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.880]   in the Ten Commandments and the moral law. The law was given by Moses.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.840]   And what we are trying to do is to see the importance of this law. We have seen that
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.360]   it is important from the Christian standpoint, very definitely. Our whole conception of salvation
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.000]   depends upon this, in a way. If we have not known some preliminary law work, well, then
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.520]   our idea of grace is a very defective one. It is only the man who has seen himself condemned
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.280]   under the law who rejoices in the grace of God in Jesus Christ our Lord. And we have
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.400]   seen that we need it also as regards our sanctification, because nothing but the law reveals unto us
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.320]   the depth of sin, the exceeding sinfulness of sin. We were looking at that last Sunday
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.600]   morning, especially in terms of the seventh chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.200]   And he comes to the terrifying but perfectly true conclusion, "In me," that is to say,
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:37.240]   "in my flesh dwelleth no good thing." That is man. And unless we know something about
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.360]   that, I say again, we cannot possibly appreciate as we should the glories and the wonders of
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:53.360]   the grace of God. All this law work is essential, and we dismiss the law only at our peril.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.520]   But now this morning I am anxious to look at this matter with you again in a more general
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:04.080]   manner, because this is a message for the whole world as well as for the Church. The
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:12.240]   law of God speaks to the whole of humanity, and never was its message needed more than
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.760]   it is at this very moment. What can we do better, therefore, on a day such as this Remembrance
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:25.080]   Day than to consider something itinerant of what the law of God has to say?
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.920]   I lay down a fundamental proposition that the whole trouble in the world at this moment
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:39.640]   is due ultimately to neglect of the law of God—neglect sometimes based upon sheer ignorance,
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:47.040]   neglect at other times due to the arrogance of unbelief and man's deliberate rejection
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.280]   of this book which is the Word of God. All the troubles, I say, in the world this morning
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:02.480]   can ultimately be traced to that one single cause—man's falling away from God, his
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.400]   consequent falling away from what he was originally and what God intended him to be.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.480]   Now let us try to work out that fundamental principle along a number of lines in order
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.080]   that I may show you how the whole situation and condition of the world at this very minute
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:29.640]   is due to this one great central cause. What does neglect of the law of God lead to? Well,
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:37.420]   the first thing is it leads to a general apostasy. And that is the position of the world speaking
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:44.800]   generally this morning. The world is in a state of apostasy, which means that it no
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.320]   longer lives its life in terms of God, and it no longer believes in God, and its life
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.920]   is no longer centered on God. That is the position of the world. I know that there'll
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.080]   be thousands, perhaps millions of people in this country today taking part in some sort
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.440]   of a religious service, but most of it will be sheer paganism. They don't believe in
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.000]   God. They sing hymns, they attend services, but they don't believe in God. They don't
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.920]   do this every day of their lives, they don't pray privately, they don't read the Word
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:24.040]   of God. We are not misled by that kind of thing. The world is in a state of apostasy.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.520]   It likes to persuade itself that it believes in God at times, but the very fact that it
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:36.280]   does that at times is in itself the greatest possible insult to the Almighty God, who demands,
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.120]   as we've seen, that we should worship him with all our heart and all our soul and all
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:49.120]   our mind and all our strength. Not just now and again, because of some special occasion.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.360]   There is no greater insult to God. There is no greater hypocrisy than just that. Thank
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.720]   God our eyes have been opened to that. That's not our condition, but this, I say, is the
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.520]   condition of the world, and the Bible throws light, therefore, upon the whole state and
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.680]   condition of the world, because you see the consequences of that.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.040]   What happens when man ceases to believe in God and to worship him and to live to his
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:21.040]   glory? Well, what happens is that man begins to believe in himself, and he sets himself
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.640]   up for some kind of God. The devil knows this very well. That was why, you remember, the
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:33.240]   original temptation was just that. "Has God indeed said that you mustn't eat of
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.800]   this fruit?" said the serpent to Eve, and then went on to say, "Of course, he says
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.600]   that because he knows very well that the day wherein you eat of that fruit you'll be
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.960]   enlightened and you'll be like God himself, and that's what you should be." And she
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.960]   fell to the temptation, and man has fallen to it ever since. The moment he ceases to
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:58.560]   subject himself to God, he sets himself up as a God. And man is worshipping man today.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.800]   He's been doing it for most of the last century. But of course, the difficulty is
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:10.880]   that a number of them are doing that. They're all doing that. And the result is that you
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:17.120]   have inevitable conflict. The moment man sets himself up as the ultimate authority and as
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:24.640]   some sort of a God, he becomes filled with pride. He becomes filled with self-worship.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.440]   The devil, the original rebel against God, as the Scriptures show us everywhere, his
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:35.360]   heart was lifted up with pride. That's why he fell. That's the whole difficulty, the
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.800]   trouble with the devil. Its self, its pride, and all of listening to him, are in the same
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:48.040]   condition. And the inevitable consequence of all that is, of course, that you get clashes,
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:54.240]   collisions. Each God wants to be supreme. Each one wants to rule. That's why every
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:00.000]   sinner is a tyrant. You can see it even in a little child. He wants his own way. He's
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.200]   intolerant. He won't be disciplined. He wants what he wants. That's the result of
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.360]   sin. And it's something that shows itself in the whole of life. And you get it, you
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.320]   see, in individuals, you get it in groups, you get it in nations. This is the cause of
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:19.200]   industrial strife. This is the cause of the tension between the nations. These rival blocs,
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.280]   these great giants, each one going higher and the other must get higher. And here you
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.160]   get this inevitable clash. Pride, inflated with pride. It's been true of every nation
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:35.480]   in its turn. That's the cause of war. The cause of war is not ultimately political nor
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:44.280]   economic. It's purely theological. It's entirely due to sin. There is no other explanation.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.840]   When scum wars among you, James asks and answers his own question, they come even of your lusts
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:56.240]   that are within you. Lust is the cause of war. And lust is the creature of pride and
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:04.040]   of self-worship. But further than that, this falling away from God, this apostasy, leads
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.680]   to an entirely false view of everything. It gives us a false notion of life, a false view
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:17.200]   of history, a false view of human greatness. And to me this is one of the most tragic things
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:24.520]   in connection with life at this present time in this country. It's true of all the countries.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:31.280]   The whole notion of life and of living and of the purpose and function of history has
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:37.160]   become lost. This is the whole tragedy of men in sin. He thinks he's exalting himself,
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:43.760]   he's actually debasing himself. What do you mean, sir, sir, when what I mean is this?
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.040]   But Charlie, there is nothing that is quite so tragic at the present time as the way in
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.560]   people have ceased to think of life and of living, and are thinking increasingly in terms
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:02.240]   of merely existing. Had you noticed that? Existence is the great thing now, not life,
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:09.040]   not living. So you see, we have seen in this our own time and our own generation, and especially
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:17.840]   since the last war, how some of the most precious things in life have gradually been going.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.640]   Let me illustrate what I mean. The whole notion of heroism is going. You don't hear much
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:29.220]   about heroism these days. Why? Well, because everybody is much too interested in preserving
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:36.200]   his own life and existence. The important thing today is to extend the length of days
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:43.080]   that a man lives in this world. So you see, the whole notion of heroism goes out, that
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.000]   there are certain things that are worth fighting for, certain things that are worth dying for.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.920]   That's gone out. There are slogans which say this. I'm only using it, I'm not concerned
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:59.160]   to be political. But a slogan like "Better be red than dead" sums up entirely what I
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:05.440]   am saying. Now there it is, you see. The terrible thing is to be dead. That's the most awful
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:11.040]   thing, is to die. Existence is the important thing. Whether you exist as a slave, it doesn't
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.600]   matter. Better exist as a slave than die as a free man. That's the idea. Now, why has
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:22.440]   that come in? That's come in because man has lost his sense of his own greatness. He's
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:28.120]   content to live in chains as long as he can just go on living and existing. Heroism is
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:35.320]   gone. Romance is gone. I understand from the newspapers that this is evidencing itself
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:41.840]   in the theatres, the so-called kitchen sink plays, whatever they call them. There's
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.960]   no romance there, there's no life there, it's just sordid, it's existence. That's
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:54.120]   not living. But people are no longer interested in life and in living, it's existence. And
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:00.680]   they want to perpetuate this horrible, foul existence. And they're no longer interested
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:07.240]   in principles. Nothing is so important that it's worth dying for. We must just go on
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:14.400]   with this sordid existence. What a tragic thing it is. Well, now, this is purely theological.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.600]   You see, this is one of the consequences of turning away from God. Of course, those people
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:23.080]   who were alive a hundred years ago who regarded themselves as great minds and thinkers and
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.640]   philosophers and scientists, they began it, but they had no idea where it was going to
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.640]   end. This is just the outcome of that. You turn away from God in an attempt to elevate
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.920]   yourself, you'll ultimately debase and lower yourself, and you'll have no respect for
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:43.800]   yourself. Man becomes just an animal, a beast. And nothing matters but food and drink and
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:49.840]   sex and existence and the perpetuation of it. So romance has gone out the window, and
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:58.680]   idealism and heroism and all things that make life truly worth living, they've gone. And
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:06.400]   the whole notion of a purpose in history and one far-off divine event to which the whole
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:13.720]   creation moves, you hear nothing about that now. But here you get these pessimists, these
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:23.320]   immoral pessimists, these men who teach experimental marriage and so on, just trying to get existence
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:30.960]   perpetuated and increased and elongated. Oh, what a fall, what a tragedy. It's a direct
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:38.600]   fall which happens because man is ignorant of the law of God and doesn't know God, and
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.400]   therefore doesn't know his own true value. Well, there it is in general, but let me go
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.520]   on and illustrate it in other respects.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:54.600]   Another consequence of forgetting or ignoring law is this, that people fail to realize that
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:01.640]   unrighteousness is always the inevitable consequence of ungodliness. Now there's a great statement
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:07.600]   of this in the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans in verse 18. "For the wrath
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:15.440]   of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men that
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:21.920]   hold down the truth in unrighteousness." Note the order. Ungodliness first, unrighteousness
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:27.520]   second following. Now that's the most important point there.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.520]   And I would venture to assert that the failure to realize and to remember this has been one
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:40.600]   of the major blunders of the last hundred years. I mean something like this. Those great
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:47.360]   Victorians so-called, they were the criminals. They're the men who did the damage. They're
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:52.640]   the men who should be pulled off their pedestals. These supposed great thinkers, the Darwins
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:58.440]   and the Huxleys and the Spencers and those who followed them, and the timorous ecclesiastical
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.680]   leaders who were so uncertain of their faith that they didn't denounce them as they should
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:09.480]   have done, but allowed their teaching to permeate even into the message of the Christian church.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:16.520]   What was their idea? Well their idea, you see, was this. That though you shed the supernatural
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:22.640]   and the miraculous, and though you really no longer believed in God in any real and
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:29.000]   in any living sense, you could nevertheless retain and hold on to all the moral ethical
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.560]   teaching of the Bible, which was incomparable and so good. So you see they all began to
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.200]   say that you could hold on to the moral ethical teaching of the Old Testament and the Sermon
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:44.880]   on the Mount, and no longer believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ and in his
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:50.480]   miracles, in his atoning death, in his resurrection, literally in the body and so on. They shed
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.920]   the theology, but they said you can still hold on to the morals and to the ethics, and
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:17:00.720]   they believed they could. So the great characteristic of the end of the last century was the formation
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:08.080]   of societies, moral societies, to reform morals and to keep this and that pure. The church
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.760]   and her message went down and down, and societies came upon all heavens. And they really believed
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.520]   it could be done, but by now it's tragically and painfully evident and obvious that it
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:26.840]   simply cannot be done. You cannot divorce morals from religion. It's impossible. Now
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:32.280]   the last hundred years has really proved that, and it is an essential part of an understanding
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:41.400]   of the age in which you and I are living. You cannot separate godliness and morality.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:47.560]   The moment you shed your godliness, you will get your unrighteousness. Ungodliness and
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:52.840]   unrighteousness of men. The one follows the other invariably. And let me show you how
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.600]   it's inevitable. This is the tragedy that people are so ignorant of the Bible. It's
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.640]   all here, the first principles are here. But they've ignored these in their wisdom and
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.560]   said that education and moral culture could do everything that was necessary. But they
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:13.160]   can't, and for this reason. To start with, you are left without a standard. Where do
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:20.040]   you get your standard from? If you banish God, if you banish the Ten Commandments, what
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:24.560]   standard have you got? Well, the answer is, of course, that you've got no standard except
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:32.280]   every man's opinion. And one man's opinion is as good as another man's opinion. Why
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.840]   should we recognize any moral standard at all? And the result is that you've had your
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:43.120]   rival schools of moral teaching. There is a school called hedonism. What does that mean?
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:49.760]   Well, that says the important thing is pleasure. We're all meant to enjoy ourselves. Pleasure,
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.760]   happiness, the cult of pleasure and of happiness. And that is right which gives me and others
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:02.440]   the greatest amount of happiness. It's been taught quite seriously. Hedonism. And you
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:07.680]   see, they claim that this surely is the thing that we should put first. We're all meant
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.520]   to be happy, why shouldn't we be happy? Well, very well, happiness is the supreme goal.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:17.520]   There's their standard. But then others, you see, say, no, the standard is a sort of
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:23.240]   utilitarianism. The best you can hope for in a world like this is to keep things going,
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:29.520]   keep them working. Utilitarianism. You don't so much ask whether a thing is good or bad,
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:38.480]   right or wrong, you ask does it work? Does it on the whole work? Utilitarianism. You
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.920]   know, the Victorians used to half-worship John Stuart Mill. That was his philosophy.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:48.600]   He was not a Christian, scarcely a theist. But that was his teaching, utilitarianism.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:53.440]   That's the thing that counts. Anything that helps, anything that works. So you see, you've
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.000]   got another standard there. Well, then others have got a slight modification of that, a
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.440]   kind of belief in expediency. Expediency. In other words, there are no such things as
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:11.960]   absolute standards. But I've got to try to judge and to estimate what's likely to
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:20.560]   work. If you like, the end justifies the means. And this has been very popular. That an end
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.200]   which is desirable justifies any means almost that you employ in getting there. It's not
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.200]   only the theory of the Jesuits, it's been adopted by nations, it's been very popular
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.960]   in social work and so on. And what is the consequence of this? Well, some people have
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:41.320]   worked it out like this. If the end justifies the means, well then might is right. If my
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:45.280]   might will enable me to get at that end, well that's all right, that justifies. That was
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:51.200]   really the philosophy of Hitler. It is the philosophy of fascism. Believing that this
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.480]   system is the right one, well then you must impose it upon men. And of course you say,
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.960]   I do this because I don't want to employ force, but what I'm saying is right. Might
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:06.080]   is right. The end justifies the means. But you've had terrible consequences coming in
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:14.720]   as well. You've had lying and deceit being defended as legitimate instruments. We've
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.920]   seen it again in the case of Hitler and others. Deliberately lying, deliberately misleading.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:26.080]   But they justify this. It's got to be done for the sake of that end. But we've known
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.640]   this, this didn't rise with Hitler. There's an old saying, "All is fair in love and
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:36.560]   war." It isn't. It's a lie. All is not fair in love and war. There are absolute
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:42.920]   standards in love and in war. But there it is. Now, I'm simply using these illustrations
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:48.680]   to establish my principle that the moment you turn your back upon the law of God, you've
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:54.160]   got no standard at all. And because you've got no standard, ultimately you will have
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:22:00.360]   no righteousness. Another way it works out is this. That because of the absence of standards,
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:06.520]   there is no longer a belief in discipline. And especially the whole notion of punishment
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:15.080]   goes. If you haven't got a standard, how can you exercise discipline? And what makes
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:22.800]   it still more complicated is this. Because of the absence of certain fundamental, eternal,
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:29.440]   absolute standards, which are dictated by the law of God, you've had developing a
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:36.080]   kind of sliding scale. Now, this is an acute modern problem, I suggest, in this way. Haven't
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:41.920]   you noticed the change in the moral standard even during our own lifetime? Say, during
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:47.520]   the last twenty years. What was frowned upon by everybody twenty years ago has become the
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.920]   thing to do now. Have you noticed it creeping into the language of the newspapers? I'm
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.440]   told it's still worse in the novels. In the ordinary language and demeanour and behaviour
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.920]   of people on the streets and everywhere else, and the things that are now allowed without
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.480]   anybody turning a hair. There were standards amongst statesmen fifty years ago they no
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:11.960]   longer obtained. A man couldn't hold office in a cabinet if he'd been divorced. He can
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.960]   now, and so on. Now, I'm just showing you this, that the moment you abolish the law
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:21.240]   of God, you've not only got every man with his own standard, you've got changing standards.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:28.000]   And the question arises, what is right? Is anything right? Each generation apparently
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.240]   has the right to determine what's right. It was the great argument used at the time
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:37.320]   of the Wulffenden Report, that you must be governed always by the majority opinion at
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:43.480]   any time, so that we must not be governed now by acts that were passed in the past,
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:48.120]   and they were based upon the law of God. No, no, that's all wrong. What's right is what
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:53.920]   is agreed upon by the majority at any time or in any given age or generation. You count
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:59.720]   heavens and you decide your morals by counting heavens. The result is, you see, that there
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.240]   is no standard of good and evil, right and wrong. And there are certain people who are
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:11.280]   actually obviously saying this, "Evil, be thou my good." It seems to me that we are
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:18.360]   reaching a stage very rapidly in which anything which is clean and pure and romantic is dismissed
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:24.440]   as outmoded, dowdy, out of date. Evil, be thou my good, unless there's something wrong
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.640]   and unclean about a thing. It's of no value, it's not artistic, and that is being applied
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:35.920]   not only in the realm of art but all along the line. And then the ultimate of this is,
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:41.120]   I say, that punishment, of course, and of necessity, is regarded as harsh and cruel.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:45.080]   How can I punish somebody for doing something if I've got the feeling within me that in
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.080]   ten years' time everybody will be agreed that that isn't wrong at all? I've no right
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.640]   to punish, so I do nothing, and there is no punishment. And the final conclusion is, you
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:00.600]   see, an ultimate lawlessness, and I think we are rapidly approaching that.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:08.600]   It's very interesting to watch this sort of rake's progress. First of all, they rebelled
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:15.880]   against the idea of sin. The Bible talks about sin. When the Bible promulgates its law, it
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:21.280]   talks about sin. Well, they objected to that. There's no such thing as sin. They got rid
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.240]   of sin. They say there may be law-breaking, there may be crime, but there's no such thing
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.480]   as sin. That's a horrible notion. Get rid of it. It's all wrong. So they got rid of
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:34.120]   that. But now we've reached a stage in which they're getting rid of crime also. There's
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:41.200]   no such thing as crime. It's all a matter of disease. So more and more you'll find
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:46.240]   in the courts that the expert medical witness is the most important person, and the judges
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:50.960]   are naturally troubled, because they've no longer any law to administer. An expert witness
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.640]   comes along and says, "This man was not responsible. He didn't know what he was doing, or he can't
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.280]   help himself. He's so mad." That's it. Don't talk about perversions. There's no such thing
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.320]   as a perversion. There's no such thing as natural. What you say is unnatural is natural
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.280]   to this man. So you've got no standard at all. There's no crime any longer. It's all
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.880]   a matter of a man's makeup, his medical condition, the balance of his glands, or something like
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.680]   that. You first of all get rid of sin, and then you get rid of crime. In the end, there's
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:25.480]   no crime. Everybody does what he wants to do. Complete and utter lawlessness and chaos.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:31.800]   But let me show you all this along another line. I do trust I'm making it abundantly
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:38.840]   clear that law is absolutely vital and essential, and that the moment we turn our backs upon
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.920]   this whole concept of law, as we find it in the Bible, we are heading for disaster. Now,
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.320]   many evangelical people, as I'm saying, have encouraged this. They say, "Don't preach
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.920]   the law any longer. Invite people to come to Christ. Don't preach the law. Don't condemn.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.840]   Don't denounce. Just tell them to come to Christ." They've been aiding and abetting
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:02.840]   this whole tendency to do away with law and to lead to the modern chaos. Let me show you
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:09.680]   this by putting it in the form of this principle, that when men and women turn their backs upon
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:16.360]   law, they always develop a dislike of negatives, and they always develop a corresponding dislike
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:25.160]   of details. Details and negatives. Let me illustrate this. The whole notion has been
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:34.920]   that all we really need is to inculcate and to develop a right general spirit. That we
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.520]   really don't need to be told in detail, "Do this and don't do that." They say,
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:46.760]   "That's absolutely insulting." What you need to do is to try to develop and to
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:55.480]   inculcate a right general good outlook and spirit. That we must never say, "Thou shalt
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:01.840]   not," but that really we should simply be always saying, "Now, isn't this wonderful?
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:10.920]   Isn't this right? Isn't this good?" You've had this principle applied all along
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:18.800]   the line. Look at it, for instance, in education, the teaching of children. We are told we must
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:25.680]   no longer mechanically teach the three R's, compel the children to learn by rote, just
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.200]   to repeat and repeat and repeat until the things got fixed in the memory. We are told
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.880]   that's absolutely wrong, it's quite insulting. You mustn't discipline the children, you
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.480]   mustn't compel them to learn and to absorb things merely in a mechanical manner to get
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.920]   their minds stored with facts. All that is being frowned upon. It's been going on now
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.840]   for at least forty years. I remember the introduction of the Montessori system quite well, which
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:55.160]   means this, you see, that instead of drumming things into the child like that and exercising
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:02.480]   discipline as you do so, that you get the child interested in this, interested in numbers
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:09.280]   and figures and mathematics and history and so on, and give explanations. The child's
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:14.760]   got an understanding. You mustn't treat it like a machine recording facts. Develop
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.840]   the interest of the child and draw it out. Well, this has been applied, as you know,
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:25.920]   the last forty years increasingly. And we are all familiar with the result to which
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.960]   it has led. You find businessmen increasingly complaining that their clerks and others are
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:38.000]   incapable of simple arithmetic, and that they are ignorant of certain facts. Why? Well,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.640]   the thing is quite inevitable. It's due to a failure to understand the true condition
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:50.440]   of a child. A child is not meant to understand. That's the age at which the memory is very
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.160]   alive and active, and you can absorb facts. It doesn't matter whether the child understands
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.960]   them or not. Understanding comes later. But what is essential at that stage is that you
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:04.440]   should have facts, so that when you are grown up, you will be able to employ your developed
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:11.840]   reason upon facts, which have already started, and which become of inestimable value to you.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:19.160]   But all this, I say, has been disliked. There it is in the realm of the child. The children
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:24.920]   are able to talk learnedly as if they understood, but they don't. They are talking theories,
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:30.080]   and they lack a basic knowledge of facts. That's because of this dislike of the negative
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:36.520]   and the detail. Just develop and inculcate this good general spirit. And, of course,
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:43.480]   it happens not only at that stage of life; it happens all along the line. And we are
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:49.760]   being told that that is all that humanity needs, and we are witnessing the consequences
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:57.080]   of that very thing. No, the answer is that the law knowing us as we don't know ourselves,
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:04.680]   the law is specific always. The law always comes down to details. And the law is very
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.960]   interested in negatives. That's why people hate the Ten Commandments. "Thou shalt not
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:15.840]   kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not commit adultery." Insulting, says men, is
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:21.880]   it? No, no, the answer is that the law knows us. And it knows that we are always ready
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:26.720]   to develop a wonderful general spirit, as long as it gives us liberty to fail in detail
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.960]   and in practice. But you are not allowed to by the law. The law pins you down. The law
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.440]   examines you on specific issues and questions. The law doesn't say, "Are you a good man?"
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.160]   It says, "Are you doing this? Are you not doing that?" It pins it down, and it's
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:46.120]   essential. It's the only way of instructing us. We can never learn truly in any realm
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:51.720]   or department without getting down to the details. I don't know what modern theory
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:56.880]   is, but I would advocate that children ought to be made to practice their scales on the
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:03.640]   piano and not start playing the masterpieces. Get down to it. The finger exercises. Get
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.600]   all this part, the mechanical part, first, so that in the end you don't have to think
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.400]   about that, and you really can give your mind, when you've reached that stage, to interpretation.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.800]   But if you start with interpretation before you write on your mechanics, the answer will
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:21.960]   be chaos. It will be discord. It's quite inevitable. But this is what is happening
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.640]   today in the whole of life. But let me go on to another, which is the application of
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:33.800]   that. All this, in the end, you see, leads to a failure to see the need of authority
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:43.920]   and the need of sanctions, because a law without sanctions is of no value. And the law always
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:50.680]   has its sanctions. When God said that if people did certain things, he would punish them,
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:56.400]   he did punish them. He didn't merely say it, he did it. Now, we've got a statement
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.920]   of this in the epistle to the Hebrews, in the second chapter, the second verse. "If
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:07.260]   the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:15.560]   a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?"
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:19.200]   God laid it down that if people did certain things, they were to be stoned to death. And
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.640]   you read your Old Testament history, and you'll find that when they did them, they were stoned
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:29.640]   to death. What God said, God did. God warned his own people. They disobeyed. He punished
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:35.440]   them as he said he would. He drove them out of paradise. He drove them into the captivity
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:42.120]   and the bondage of Egypt. He drove them into Babylon. What God says, God does. Law always
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:49.880]   carries sanctions. Law, the whole concept and notion of law, carries the notion of authority
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:58.240]   which can apply the law and which can mete out the punishments denounced by the law.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:05.440]   But I say all this is most unpopular in this age and generation to which you and I belong.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:10.660]   And that's why the world is as it is. The world, in a sense, is suffering from a false
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:14.920]   view of love and of grace. The whole trouble with the world is that it's forgotten the
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.800]   first half of our text. It says, "Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ." That's all
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:24.520]   that's needed. Preach Christ. Preach him as an example. Preach him as a moral teacher.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.600]   Preach him as the pale Galilean. Preach him as a most wonderful person. That's all you
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:35.600]   need. Drop your law. They've left out, "Law came by Moses." All we need is grace and truth.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:40.780]   The world thinks it believes in love. That's why it no longer worships God. Love is the
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:45.220]   universal self, and everybody believes in the love of God. That's why they don't believe
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:52.460]   in God, because in God there is always law. So they start with this false notion. And
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:57.700]   starting there, you see, with a false notion concerning God and his righteousness and his
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:03.600]   holiness and his determination to punish evil, they go on to their false view of man and
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:11.660]   his nature. The idea is today, isn't it, that man is fundamentally good? That's why they
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:17.260]   don't like the biblical teaching about sin. That's why they ridicule some of the hymns.
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:22.860]   I've told you before of a man, a theologian, so-called in this century, who ridiculed Charles
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:30.620]   Wesley's hymn for saying, "Just and holy is thy name. I am all unrighteousness. Foul
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:35.260]   and full of sin I am." He said, "You mustn't say that. When you apply for a job, you don't
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:38.860]   say that to your prospective employer. Why should you say it to God? It's not true.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:44.140]   Get rid of it." That's Old Testament. That's wrong. That's Moses. Grace and truth. Man
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:49.780]   is essentially good. And because of these two things, that God is love only and man
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:56.780]   is essentially good, this is the teaching. That all that is really necessary to put the
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:05.260]   world right is that men should be shown the right way. He should be given a picture of
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:12.300]   life as it is ideal. And that includes, of course, the banishing of war. That you have
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:17.340]   a great League of Nations, call it what you will, United Nations organization. That the
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:22.220]   nations destroy all their armaments and they'll all live happily together. What a wonderful
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:27.860]   picture. All is necessary, they say, is that you put that concept before men. And of course,
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:32.000]   they did it after the First World War, they did it after the Second, and I remember the
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.340]   idealism after the First, one in particular. There wasn't so much after the Second, of
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:41.900]   course, people are beginning to learn unconsciously. But after the First, the League of Nations.
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:47.020]   This glorious idea. It must happen. Nobody can refuse to believe this and to practice
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:53.220]   it. Set it before them. God is love, man is essentially good, he's bound to rise to it.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:37:00.980]   Set it before him and then appeal to him. Don't say thou shalt not, but say isn't this
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:06.180]   wonderful? Doesn't this appeal to you? Surely, be reasonable, be appealing. So they did it
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:10.300]   and they tried that with Hitler. That was what was called appeasement afterwards, but
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:14.220]   they believed it. Surely, said Mr. Neville Chamberlain, if I only meet him as man to
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.260]   man, I'm a businessman. I never yet failed. When I meet a man across the table, it's all
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:22.020]   very well sending diplomatic notes, but I meet him man to man and I make an—it's
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:28.380]   bound to—he believed it. He was quite honest, he was perfectly sincere. It was his theology
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:34.060]   that was wrong. And then, you see, we say, after putting the great ideal before them
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:40.260]   and appealing to them, you then give an example. You give a great moral example. Some of you
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:45.460]   remember a man during the period between the two world wars, when the war broke out between
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:52.060]   Japan and China concerning Manchuria. He called for volunteers. He was a Christian leader.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:56.500]   He called for people to volunteer to go and sit down between the two rival armies, and
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:01.500]   he really believed that this wonderful moral example would put an end to the war. There
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:06.380]   are people urging today that this country should disarm unilaterally. Why? Well, they
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:11.060]   say, "Great Britain did that. The moral example, it would shake the nations. They'd
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:15.420]   all destroy their arms immediately." I'm not here to preach politics, but I am here
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:22.100]   to preach theology. And all I am saying is that that is devastatingly, hopelessly bad
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:29.300]   theology. Moral example. Does man rise to moral example? If he did, the picture of Christ
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:33.980]   has been here before him for nearly two thousand years. They will all long since have risen
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:40.500]   and followed him, but they don't, because man is fundamentally evil, and because he
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:46.580]   doesn't know that he needs sanctions, that he needs law. The human heart is desperately
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:55.940]   wicked and deceitful. Who can know it? The Bible, in other words, puts it like this,
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:03.740]   that there is nothing finally which is so wrong as to appeal in Christian terms to people
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:10.460]   who are not Christians. That is terrible heresy. A man who is not a Christian cannot be expected
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:15.300]   to live the Christian life, and to ask him to do so is a denial of the truth of the Bible.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:21.580]   To preach grace and truth to people who have never known condemnation is absolutely fatal.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:25.900]   But that's what the world has been doing, and that is what the ideal is doing. This
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:33.020]   is the ultimate heresy of pacifism. Pacifism is a pure heresy. It expects Christian conduct
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:37.820]   and behavior from people who are not Christian. It believes you can apply the principles of
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:46.500]   the teaching of Christ to people who are not regenerate. That is rank heresy. That is not
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:51.300]   to say that war is a good thing. War is an evil thing. It's a bad thing. But the Bible
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:59.060]   teaching can be put like this, that until a man comes under grace, you have got to keep
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:08.460]   him under law. Man is so evil that he's got to be kept under law until he comes under
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:15.780]   grace. That is why you have such things as kings and queens and emperors and governments.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.660]   That is why I read to you at the beginning that portion out of the thirteenth chapter
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:25.100]   of the epistle to the Romans, "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers, for
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:30.100]   there is no power but of God." He was including the Roman emperor there, remember. He was
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:37.780]   including the Roman empire. He was including pagan states. The powers that be are ordained
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:47.660]   of God. And the magistrate "Beareth not the sword in vain." Law must be enforced.
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:54.140]   It must be applied. It must have sanctions. And the Bible says that man is so rotten,
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:59.820]   so evil. The law it is that reveals how evil, as we've already seen. He is so evil, it's
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:05.660]   no use appealing to him. He's got his own standards. He doesn't agree with your law.
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:10.140]   He doesn't agree that that's the ideal. The majority of people in this country tonight,
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:14.820]   this morning, do not regard the Lord Jesus Christ and his way of life as being ideal.
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:20.380]   Of course they don't. They're like this sordid horror that I've been referring to.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:25.540]   They won't rise to the example of Christ and follow him. Man is so rotten, the law reveals
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:31.460]   it, that he's just got to be kept in order. He's got to be punished. The law's got to
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:36.060]   be applied. You've got to hurt him. It's the only language he understands. He hasn't got
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:41.700]   it in him to respond to the glories of God. You need emperors. You need kings. You need
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:46.900]   the powers that be. You must have a sword. Evil must be restrained. Otherwise the world
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:53.340]   would become nothing but sheer chaos. That's the biblical teaching. That's the essence
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:42:00.980]   of this whole matter of law. Evil must be forcibly restrained. It must be punished.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:07.420]   The way of the transgressor is hard, and it must be made hard. And that is one of the
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:14.320]   ways whereby you have some hope eventually, that he will be ready to listen to the message
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:21.220]   of grace and truth that has come in and through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. It is only
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:25.540]   when the prodigal finds himself in the far country with the husks and the swine that
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:31.020]   he begins to realise the truth concerning home. He had to get down to that before he
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:40.700]   did, and mankind is still like that. It is being punished. I regard these two world wars
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:47.460]   as a part of the punishment of mankind for its apostasy from God. And it will get more
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:57.940]   and more and more until the final return of Christ and the ultimate judgment. That's
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:03.980]   the position as regards the world. But for the individual, the message is, realise the
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:10.540]   truth of all this. Cease kicking against the bricks. Cease fighting against the law of
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:15.980]   God, for it is the law of God and he'll enforce it. He has sanctions, he has the power, and
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:23.580]   he will see that it's carried out. And the final verdict upon lawlessness and unbelief
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:32.620]   and rebellion is eternal banishment from the presence of God. And when a man realises that,
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:37.940]   he is then ready and only then ready to listen truly to the message which tells him that
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:44.540]   grace and truth have come through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:49.220]   Christian people, I've taken you through this this morning in the hope that you in
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:54.020]   turn will preach it to your neighbours, to those who work with you in offices, with whom
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:58.660]   you mix anywhere. I hope you'll put it in this way, that they'll not be misled by
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:07.100]   this false idealism that masquerades as Christianity, but which is a denial of biblical teaching.
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:16.180]   I trust you'll enable them to see that Christianity is not some vague, flabby sentimentality,
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:23.120]   but that it is based on law, on justice, on truth, on righteousness, leading to the grace
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:37.460]   of God in Jesus Christ our Lord. May God enable us all to do so. Amen.
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:46.300]   The closing hymn is hymn number 525. 525. Grant us thy light that we may know the wisdom
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:52.540]   thou alone canst give, that truth may guide where'er we go, and virtue bless where'er
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:54.540]   we live. 525.
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:45:12.540]   [organ music]
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:28.540]   Grant us thy light that we may know the wisdom thou alone canst give, that truth may guide
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:49.540]   where'er we go, and virtue bless where'er we live. Grant us thy light that we may see
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:46:06.540]   the world as we've heard of old, and love you with heart and spirit, and love thy people
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:25.540]   as we've heard of old. Grant us thy light that we may know the way is right, the way
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:54.540]   is right. Grant us thy light that we may know the truth, that truth may guide where'er
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:47:16.540]   we go, and love you with heart and spirit, and love thy people as we've heard of old.
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:33.540]   Grant us thy light that we may know the way, for every tree shall know thy glory, every
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:51.540]   tree shall know thy glory.
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:57.540]   And now unto him who is able to keep us from falling, and to present us faultless before
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:06.540]   the presence of his glory, with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:15.540]   glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. And may grace, mercy and peace
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:21.540]   from God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:29.540]   now, throughout the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage,
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:40.540]   and until we come to that deathless home in that endless day. Amen.
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:44.540]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
