[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.380]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.340]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.920]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.020]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.040]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.240]   This podcast is separate
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.660]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.700]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.760]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.040]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.360]   to the general public.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.240]   Today, we're going to talk about how hormones
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.040]   impact feeding and hunger, as well as satiety,
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.560]   the feeling that you don't want to eat
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.720]   or that you've eaten enough.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.000]   Now, it's important to understand
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.660]   that hormones don't work alone in this context.
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.480]   Today, I'm going to describe some hormones
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.080]   that have powerful effects
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.380]   on whether or not you want to eat more or less
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.720]   or stop eating altogether.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.760]   But they don't do that on their own.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.460]   They do that in cooperation with the nervous system.
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.000]   The first thing that you need to know
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.680]   about the nervous system side,
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.060]   the neural control over feeding and hunger,
[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.520]   is that there's an area of your brain
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.000]   called the hypothalamus.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.720]   Now, the hypothalamus contains lots of different kinds
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.000]   of neurons doing lots of different kinds of things.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.440]   There's a particular area of the hypothalamus
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.360]   called the ventromedial hypothalamus.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.800]   And it's one that researchers have been interested
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.520]   for a long time now
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.200]   in terms of its relationship to hunger and feeding.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.800]   And the reason is it creates these paradoxical effects.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.720]   What do I mean by that?
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.320]   What they found was that sometimes lesioning
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.200]   or disrupting the neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.540]   would make animals or people hyperphagic.
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.840]   They would want to eat like crazy.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.040]   And other lesions in other individuals or animals
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.320]   would make them anorexic.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.120]   It would make them not want to eat at all.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.760]   It would make food aversive.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.240]   So that means that the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.300]   is definitely an interesting control station
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.200]   for hunger and feeding and satiety,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.240]   but it doesn't really tell you what's going on
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.320]   at a deeper level.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.640]   In fact, it's a little bit confusing
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.160]   or paradoxical.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.100]   It turns out that there are multiple populations
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.940]   of neurons in there.
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.520]   Some are promoting feeding
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.320]   and some are promoting not feeding or not eating.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.800]   Now, the other neural component of all this
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.400]   that you need to know about
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.240]   actually has to do with your mouth.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.560]   So there's an area of your cortex.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.160]   So that's a little bit further up in your brain
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.840]   called the insular cortex.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.240]   And it processes a lot of different kinds of information,
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.660]   mostly information about what's going on inside you,
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.680]   so-called interoception.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.040]   The insular cortex has neurons
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.540]   that get input from your mouth,
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.840]   from the touch receptors in your mouth.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.120]   An insular cortex has powerful control
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.780]   over whether or not you are enjoying what you're eating,
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.120]   whether or not you want to avoid what you're eating,
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.480]   whether or not you've had enough
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.280]   or whether or not you want to continue eating more.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.140]   And that has to do, believe it or not,
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.760]   with the touch or sensation of eating.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.080]   But the key point right now
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.480]   is to know that you've got these two brain areas,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.120]   the ventromedial hypothalamus,
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.600]   that's involved in hunger and lack of hunger.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.320]   And you have this insular cortex
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.680]   that gets input from your mouth
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.920]   and cares about chewing and the consistency of foods
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.320]   and all sorts of interesting things
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.760]   that are just very tactile.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.840]   And I think most people think about the touch receptors on,
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.960]   excuse me, the taste receptors on the tongue,
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.560]   but we often don't think about
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.880]   the touch or tactile essence of food.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.600]   Now, let's get back to the ventromedial hypothalamus.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.360]   Sometimes it makes animals or people want to eat more,
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.200]   sometimes less.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.400]   So what's going on there?
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.700]   There's a classic experiment that was done
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.260]   in which researchers took two rats
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.820]   and so-called parabiose to them to each other.
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.640]   What that meant is that they did a little surgery
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.440]   and they linked their blood supply
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.200]   so that they were forever physically linked to one another
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.680]   and could exchange factors in the blood,
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.740]   but their brains were separate, their mouths were separate,
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.020]   and they essentially did everything separately
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.340]   except that they were linked to one another.
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.180]   So they had to walk together
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.380]   and go to the same places in order to do it.
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.740]   This parabiosis experiment
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.780]   revealed something really important.
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.920]   When they lesioned the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.240]   in one of the rats that was connected to the other rat,
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.980]   that rat got very, very fat.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.660]   It's just really obese.
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.700]   The other one, however, got very thin.
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.260]   It actually lost weight.
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.260]   So what does this tell us?
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.740]   This tells us that there's something in the blood
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.260]   that's being exchanged between the two animals
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.900]   because it was their blood supply that was linked.
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.620]   And that tells us that there's hormone or endocrine signals
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.820]   that are involved in the desire to eat
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.540]   and hunger and appetite.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.780]   And so next, we're going to talk about
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.820]   what those endocrine signals are.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.760]   And then I'm going to immediately point
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.860]   to some entry points that you can use,
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.400]   and you can use these
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.980]   even if you're not parabiosed to anything,
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.020]   and that can allow you to time your meal frequency
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.860]   and predict when you're going to be hungry or not.
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.020]   So let's talk about the endocrine factors
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.580]   that regulate feeding, hunger, and satiety.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.900]   One of the really exciting things to emerge
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.340]   in the science of feeding and appetite in the last 20 years
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.340]   is the discovery of another brain area,
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.300]   not just the ventromedial hypothalamus,
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.540]   but it's an area of the brain called the arcuate nucleus.
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.620]   And the arcuate nucleus
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.580]   has some really fascinating sets of neurons
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.100]   that release even more incredible molecules
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.160]   and chemicals into the blood.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.400]   And these chemicals act as accelerators
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.860]   on feeding and appetite or breaks.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.960]   So first of all, there are a set of neurons
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.300]   in this arcuate nucleus.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.980]   It's the pro-opio-melanocortin system.
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.980]   Now, the POMC neurons make something called alpha-MSH,
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.820]   melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.700]   alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.700]   MSH reduces appetite, and it's a powerful molecule.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.740]   All right, so just put that on the shelf.
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.240]   MSH reduces appetite.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.180]   Now, there's another population of neurons
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.160]   in the arcuate nucleus called the AGRP neurons.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.880]   The AGRP neurons stimulate eating.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.440]   The activity in these AGRP neurons goes way up
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.360]   when animals or people haven't eaten for a while.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.380]   And the activity of MSH, the release of MSH,
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.280]   goes up when we've eaten.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.520]   Next, let's talk about a hormone peptide
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.600]   that activates hunger.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.740]   And this is a really interesting one
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.660]   because it relates to when you get hungry
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.560]   in addition to the fact that you get hungry at all.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.840]   And it's called ghrelin.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.360]   It's spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.360]   Ghrelin is released actually from the GI tract.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.360]   And its main role is to increase your desire to eat.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.760]   And it does that through a variety of mechanisms.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.580]   Part of that is to stimulate some of the brain areas,
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.800]   the actual neurons that make you want to eat.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.780]   In addition, it creates food anticipatory signals
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.740]   within your nervous system.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.220]   So you start thinking about the things
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.140]   that you happen to like to eat
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.540]   at that particular time of day.
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.580]   This is fascinating.
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.800]   Ghrelin is sort of like a clock, a hormonal clock,
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.140]   that makes you want to eat at particular times.
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.500]   Now, the signal for ghrelin
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.480]   is reduced glucose levels in the blood.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.740]   If it drops too low, ghrelin is secreted from your gut.
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.260]   It activates neurons in your brain at various locations.
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.160]   We all know about the famous Pavlovian experiments
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.120]   of Pavlov's dogs.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.620]   You know, they start salivating to the bell
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.880]   after the bell was presented with food.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.720]   You remove the food
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.260]   and then just the bell can stimulate the salivation.
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.080]   We become Pavlovian at times.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.940]   But rarely is it ever discussed
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.080]   what the neural pathways for that are.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.880]   And it turns out that these hormones
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.360]   that are secreted from the gut
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.760]   can stimulate the neurons to create a sensation
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.980]   and a desire for certain foods at certain times of day.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.180]   You've done this experiment.
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.440]   If you are somebody who eats breakfast
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.480]   at more or less the same time each day,
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.360]   let's say 8 a.m., your ghrelin secretion
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.720]   will start to match when you typically eat.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.560]   And it's able to override the low levels of glucose
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.520]   in your bloodstream because the ghrelin system
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.400]   also gets input from a clock in your liver
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.080]   that is linked to the clock
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.960]   in your hypothalamus in your brain.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.400]   And what this means is if you eat at regular mealtimes,
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.960]   you will start to get hungry a few minutes
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.040]   before those mealtimes.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.920]   If you've ever wondered
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.900]   why your stomach kind of starts to growl
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.000]   because it's a particular time of day,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.620]   you're like, "Oh, I must want to eat."
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.240]   Well, that's ghrelin.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.720]   So ghrelin is secreted as a kind of food anticipatory signal
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.880]   to get you motivated to go eat at regular times.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.680]   But what that means is that if you suddenly go from eating
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.280]   on a very regular schedule to skipping a meal
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.900]   or pushing your meal timing out or shifting at all,
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.400]   you're going to have ghrelin in your system.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.980]   And that ghrelin is going to stimulate the desire to eat
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.780]   by acting at the level of your brain.
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.400]   So ghrelin stimulates the AGRP neurons,
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.160]   which makes you want to eat.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.620]   Regularity of eating equals regularity of ghrelin secretion
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.680]   equals regularity of activity of these AGRP neurons,
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.520]   meaning you will be hungry at very regular intervals.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.760]   So if MSH inhibits feeding, makes us want to eat less,
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.440]   and ghrelin makes us want to eat more,
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.980]   there's another hormone called CCK, cholecystokinin,
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.720]   that is potent in reducing our levels of hunger.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.380]   Now, CCK is in the GI tract.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.220]   It's released from the GI tract.
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.980]   And its release is governed by two things.
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.260]   One is a subset of very specialized neurons
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.960]   that detect what's in the gut,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.580]   the specific contents of the gut.
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.860]   And by certain elements of the mucosa,
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.540]   the mucous lining of the gut and the gut microbiome.
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.580]   So what's really interesting is that CCK
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:45.580]   is stimulated by fatty acids, amino acids,
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.980]   and particular amino acids that we'll talk about,
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.900]   as well as by sugar.
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.500]   So which fatty acids in the gut
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.700]   stimulate the release of CCK?
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.700]   Omega-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid, CLA,
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.740]   either from food or from supplements,
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.860]   stimulate the release of CCK,
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.260]   which then reduces or at least blunts appetite.
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.060]   The other thing that stimulates CCK that I mentioned
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.540]   are amino acids.
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.820]   So when we eat,
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:19.220]   we have the ability to break down different macronutrients,
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.060]   you know, carbohydrates, fats, or proteins
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.740]   into sugars and glucose that then we can convert to ATP
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.780]   and all that stuff from the Krebs cycle from high school.
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.860]   We're not going to go into that today.
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.140]   That's for a future episode.
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.780]   Amino acids both can be used as energy
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.220]   through a process called gluconeogenesis
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.420]   of converting proteins into energy,
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.900]   or those amino acids can be broken down
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.860]   and then rebuilt into things like repairing muscle tissue,
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.120]   as well as other forms of cellular repair.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.180]   They're involved in all sorts of things
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.340]   related to protein synthesis.
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.940]   What does this mean?
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.780]   If we eat the proper amino acids at the proper levels,
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.060]   if we ingest omega-3s and CLAs,
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.340]   conjugated linoleic acids, at the proper levels,
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.220]   or get them from supplements,
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.100]   there's a blunting of appetite.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.180]   Appetite is kept clamped and we don't become hyperphagic.
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.260]   We don't overeat.
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.280]   We tend to eat within healthy or normal ranges.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.340]   So this is very important
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:18.220]   because most people don't understand that when we're eating,
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:23.180]   we are basically fat foraging and amino acid foraging.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.080]   In other words, even if it's not conscious,
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.340]   we are eating until we trigger the activation of CCK.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.420]   Now, there are other reasons why we shut down eating too.
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.060]   The volume of food in our gut can be large
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.980]   and we can feel very distended.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.960]   That's the physical reason, obviously.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.540]   But at a subconscious level,
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.640]   the gut is informing the brain via CCK and other mechanisms
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.020]   when we've ingested enough of what we need.
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.880]   So as you can see,
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.540]   feeding is an interplay between brain and body,
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.220]   and it's some of the micronutrients
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.280]   and even the breakdown of particular nutrients
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.220]   that's putting the accelerator
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.180]   or the brake on the feeding process.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.900]   You are essentially trying to eat to get these nutrients,
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.220]   and then a signal can be deployed up to your brain
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.320]   that you're not really interested in eating that much more.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.220]   There's one particular aspect of food
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.380]   that can powerfully impact CCK,
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.960]   and I think most people,
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.100]   I'm guessing 99.9% of people out there
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.940]   are not aware of this.
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.580]   And it has to do with highly processed foods.
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.740]   There's a lot of reasons why one would want to avoid
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.600]   highly processed foods.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.200]   In fact, if you're interested in that topic
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.480]   and the history of whole foods
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.540]   transitioning to highly processed foods in this country,
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.400]   I highly recommend you listen to a YouTube video
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.080]   by Dr. Robert Lustig.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.160]   He's at University of California, San Francisco.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.320]   It gives a beautiful description of the history of this
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.920]   and why the food industry started packing in
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.560]   additional sugars and salts
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.480]   and turning foods into commodities.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.200]   It's really fascinating.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.560]   It has no conspiracy theory.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.320]   It's just all scientific facts.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.680]   It's really a wonderful lecture.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.400]   It has millions of views, should be very easy to find.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.160]   There's another reason to avoid
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.240]   highly processed foods, however.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.040]   And that has to do with what's called emulsifiers.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.960]   Now, many of you are familiar with emulsifiers,
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.240]   even though you don't know it.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.200]   When you put detergent in the laundry,
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.840]   that contains emulsifiers.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.640]   The goal of that detergent is to bring together
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.240]   fatty molecules with water molecules
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.440]   and be able to dissociate them and break them up
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.280]   to get the stains out of clothes and things of that sort.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:29.560]   There are a lot of emulsifiers put into processed foods.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.760]   And those emulsifiers allow certain chemical reactions
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.240]   to occur that extends the shelf life of those foods.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.120]   Why are emulsifiers bad?
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.680]   Okay, there are a lot of reasons why they're bad,
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.000]   but the reason why they're bad for the mechanisms
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.660]   that we've been talking about today
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.040]   is that when you ingest those foods,
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.720]   you're bringing those emulsifiers into your gut.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.760]   And those emulsifiers strip away
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.880]   the mucosal lining of the gut.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.200]   And they actually cause the neurons that innervate the gut,
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.560]   that extend those little processes we call axons
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.280]   into the gut to retract deeper into the gut.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.440]   And as a consequence, you're ingesting a bunch of food
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.560]   and the signals like CCK never get deployed.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.880]   The signals that actually shut down hunger
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.300]   are never actually triggered.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.620]   And so as a consequence, you want to eat far more
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.360]   of these highly processed foods.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.720]   In addition, if you then go from eating
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.080]   a highly processed food to non-highly processed foods,
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.880]   you're not able to measure the amounts of amino acids,
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.120]   sugars, and fatty acids in those foods as accurately.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.440]   You've actually done structural damage at a micro level,
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.840]   but structural level damage, excuse me,
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.480]   to the mucosal lining of the gut.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.520]   Now this can all be repaired if you stay away
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.920]   from highly processed foods for some period of time.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.160]   But the negative effects of these emulsifiers
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.400]   are quite real.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.040]   So to make it really clean and simple,
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.360]   emulsifiers from highly processed foods
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.920]   are limiting your gut's ability to detect
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.100]   what's in the foods you eat,
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.480]   and therefore to deploy the satiety signals,
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.360]   the signals that shut down hunger.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.360]   In addition to that, there's a parallel mechanism at play
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.200]   that I talked about in a previous episode,
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.060]   but I'll remind you again that you have neurons in your gut
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:10.640]   that are sensing sugar and are sending a subconscious signal
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.060]   up to the brain via the vagus nerve.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.960]   And those neurons trigger the release of dopamine,
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.780]   which makes you crave more of that food.
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.000]   So now you've got parallel signals
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.920]   making you want to eat more sugar,
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.080]   making you unaware of how much sugar you've eaten,
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.240]   and that are disrupting the inputs to the nervous system
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.040]   that signal to the rest of your brain and body
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.080]   that you've obtained enough fatty acids
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.600]   and you've obtained enough amino acids.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.680]   So these highly processed foods are really terrible.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.800]   And I'm not out here to say,
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.200]   never enjoy a processed food of any kind.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.500]   I'd be a hypocrite 'cause I do eat processed foods
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.340]   from time to time.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.800]   Although the ones that I tend to eat,
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.440]   I try and make of the healthier variety,
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.520]   but eating whole foods has tremendous value
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.360]   and eating highly processed food
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.520]   has tremendous negative impact on the gut
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.320]   and on the gut brain axis.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.800]   The bottom line is that highly processed foods
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.680]   are just bad for you.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.040]   They increase weight gain.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.800]   They disrupt the lining of your gut
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.120]   in a way that disrupts things like CCK
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.700]   and proper satiety signals.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.120]   So there's just so many reasons
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.140]   why these highly processed foods are terrible.
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.400]   And they can explain a lot of the ill health effects
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.440]   that we've seen in the last 50 years,
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.360]   not just in the United States, but all over the world.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.720]   The enormous increase in diabetes, juvenile diabetes.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:29.680]   It's just remarkable how far down the path of bad we've gone
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.980]   and it's clear, it's almost a smoking gun
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.140]   what the cause of this is.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.920]   If you'd like to learn more about that,
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.760]   please refer to the Lustig lecture.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.240]   He also spells out why non-processed foods
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.880]   is far more economical
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.440]   in terms of just at the level of the household
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.000]   or individual, as well as at the societal level.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Really interesting stuff.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.400]   I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.320]   So now let's move on to some other hormones
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.900]   that regulate hunger and satiety.
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.080]   In particular, insulin.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.040]   Now you've probably heard of insulin before.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.420]   Insulin is the thing that's lacking in type one diabetics.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.600]   That's why they have to inject insulin whenever they eat.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.880]   The reason they have to do that
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.200]   is because when they eat,
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.840]   their foods are broken down into glucose.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.460]   And in order to shuttle glucose
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.520]   to the appropriate tissues in the body
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.260]   and also to keep glucose levels in check, you need insulin.
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.800]   So the simplest way to think about insulin and glucose
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.040]   is that when you eat, that food is broken down into sugars.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.240]   That's true whether or not it's fats or it's sugars
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.760]   or eventually if it's proteins,
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.440]   they're oxidized into fuels as we say.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.320]   Your blood sugar needs to be kept in a particular range.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.160]   Hypoglycemic means too low.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.480]   Hyperglycemic means too high.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.480]   And what they called euglycemic, E-U glycemic
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.800]   is the healthy range.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.160]   Now, what those healthy ranges are,
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.080]   in general, the healthy range, the euglycemic range
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.360]   is about 70 to 100 nanograms per deciliter.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.080]   Why is it important that glucose
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.640]   be kept at a particular level?
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.040]   Once you understand that,
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.020]   keeping glucose in check starts to have a rationale
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.420]   behind it and the ways to do that
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.940]   start to make a lot more sense.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:15.940]   So the reason is if glucose levels get too high
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.540]   because of the way that our cells in particular neurons
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.280]   interact with glucose,
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:25.260]   high levels of glucose can damage neurons.
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.140]   It can actually kill them.
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.500]   You can start getting what are called peripheral,
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.260]   excuse me, neuropathies.
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.700]   One of the symptoms of some forms of diabetes
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.220]   is that people start losing the sensation of touch
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.700]   in their fingers or their hands or their feet,
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.180]   and they can start going blind.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.260]   There's diabetic retinopathies.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.180]   So it's very important
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.220]   that insulin manage your glucose levels.
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.300]   Now, there's also type two diabetes
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.520]   where there's insulin secreted from the pancreas,
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.120]   but people are insulin insensitive.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.300]   There's a disruption in the receptors
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.700]   and insulin insensitivity isn't quite the same
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.380]   as having no insulin at all,
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.540]   but it parallels some of the same mechanisms.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.660]   Now, type one diabetes is often picked up
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.120]   because someone has a sudden weight loss
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.980]   because they're not processing blood sugar
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.220]   the same way they were before.
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.140]   Type two diabetes is often, although not always,
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.580]   associated with being overweight and with obesity.
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.420]   Both of them are challenging conditions.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.060]   Type two diabetes almost always can be managed
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.200]   by managing one's weight.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.660]   And of course, there are prescription drugs
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.460]   and supplements that can help manage those.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.240]   We're going to talk about all of that.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.820]   But for most people that don't have diabetes,
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.700]   the important thing is to manage glucose,
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.820]   to keep it in that euglycemic range.
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.060]   And there are a number of different ways to do that.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.500]   Some of them are behavioral, some of them are diet-based,
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.380]   and some of them are based on supplements
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.300]   or prescription drugs.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.800]   So let's talk about those now.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.580]   So if you eat, and in particular, if you eat carbohydrates,
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.980]   blood glucose goes up.
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.380]   If you eat fats, blood glucose goes up to a far less degree.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.580]   And if you eat proteins, depending on the protein,
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.760]   it'll eventually be broken down for fuel
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.060]   or assembled into amino acid chains for protein synthesis
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.260]   and repair of other tissues and bodily functions.
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.940]   But glucose goes up and then is kept in range.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.340]   When you are hungry, you secrete a different hormone,
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.080]   and that's called glucagon.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:31.080]   And glucagon's main role is to pull stores of energy
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.480]   out of the liver and the muscles.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.480]   And once those are depleted,
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.640]   you'll eventually tap into body fat.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.860]   So the two kind of push and pull systems
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.040]   that we're going to think about now to keep this simple
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.880]   is that you have the insulin system managing glucose,
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.040]   and you've got the glucagon system pulling energy
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.720]   out of your liver and muscles for immediate fuel.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.980]   And eventually you'll pull fuel out of body fat
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.740]   if you've been active for a very long time
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.000]   and all your glycogen stores are depleted
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.880]   or close to depleted.
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.520]   So what does this all mean?
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.760]   Let's say you had a meal and that meal consisted of rice,
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.520]   a carbohydrate, some meat or fish,
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.420]   let's say a piece of salmon, and some vegetable,
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.640]   some fibrous vegetable like asparagus or cabbage
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.840]   or something like that.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.520]   If you were to eat all of that at once,
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.320]   you take a bite of one, a bite of the other,
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.480]   you mix it up, then you will experience an increase
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.000]   in insulin and increase in blood glucose
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.960]   that's moderately fast.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.320]   It's going to increase pretty quickly.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.880]   What's remarkable is that the order
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.280]   that you consume each macronutrient
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.460]   has a pretty profound influence on the rate of insulin
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.080]   and glucose secretion into the blood
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.820]   and how quickly those levels rise.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.800]   If you were to eat the fibrous thing first,
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.400]   so a lot of chewing, but not a big rise in blood glucose,
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.360]   that will actually blunt the release of glucose
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.000]   until you eat the fish and the rice.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.040]   But believe it or not,
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.960]   it will actually blunt the glucose increase
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.680]   that the rice would cause.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.200]   Now, I'm not talking about neurotically
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.380]   eating each macronutrient separately in sequence.
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.600]   I'm just trying to give you a picture
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.660]   of what's happening ordinarily.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.440]   So what does this all mean?
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.560]   It means that if you want a steep increase in glucose,
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.680]   you are very, very hungry,
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:23.240]   then you should eat the carbohydrate-laden food first,
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.840]   or you should eat a bunch of macronutrients combined.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.840]   So that would be like the hamburger or the sandwich,
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.640]   the bread, whatever's in that sandwich all together.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.240]   Usually that's protein and vegetables as well.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.820]   If you want to have a kind of more modest
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.800]   increase in glucose,
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.720]   or you want to blunt the increase in glucose,
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.980]   then have at least some of the fibrous thing first,
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.680]   and then the protein, and then the carbohydrate.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.280]   You will notice that your blood glucose
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.100]   will rise more steadily,
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.080]   and that you'll achieve satiety earlier in the meal.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.280]   Basically what you're trying to avoid
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.760]   are steep increases in blood sugar.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.120]   And the order that you eat foods
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.300]   has an enormous impact on that.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.960]   The other thing that has an enormous impact
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.520]   on how long and shallow or how steep
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.600]   that curve of glucose is,
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.920]   depends on whether or not you recently were moving,
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.700]   are moving, or start moving after you eat.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.040]   So it turns out that your blood glucose levels
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.500]   can be modulated very, very powerfully by movement.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.160]   If you did any kind of intense exercise,
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.280]   or even just walking, or jogging, or cycling,
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.300]   anything before you eat,
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.620]   your blood glucose levels will be dampened somewhat.
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.900]   And even just moving after a meal,
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.400]   even just a calm, easy walk,
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.800]   can really adjust the ways
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.400]   in which blood sugar regulated for the better.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.620]   The other thing I'd like to address for a moment
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.280]   is this notion of stable blood sugar
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.760]   versus labile blood sugar, or unstable blood sugar.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.640]   Some people just have stable blood sugar.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.240]   They can go long periods of time
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.680]   without eating and feel fine.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.560]   Other people get really shaky, really jittery,
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.240]   and/or when they do eat, they feel really keyed up.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.860]   Sometimes they'll even sweat.
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.220]   But whether or not your blood sugar is all over the place,
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.120]   or whether or not it's stable,
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.820]   can be impacted by a number of things.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.960]   One of those things is exercise.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.020]   So these days, there's a lot of interest
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.460]   in what they call zone two cardio,
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.180]   which is that kind of steady state cardio
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.680]   where you can just nasal breathe,
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.660]   even at pretty high output,
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.820]   where you could maybe have a conversation.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:27.420]   Zone two cardio that lasts anywhere from 30 minutes
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.380]   to an hour, or sometimes more for you endurance athletes,
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.460]   can create positive effects on blood sugar regulation
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.300]   such that you, people can sit down
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.780]   and enjoy whatever it is, the hot fudge sundae,
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.060]   or whatever the high sugar content food is.
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.020]   And blood glucose management is so good,
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:49.720]   your insulin sensitivity is so high, which is a good thing,
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.060]   that you can manage that blood glucose
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.100]   to the point where it doesn't really make you shaky,
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.900]   it doesn't disrupt you.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:01.420]   Basically, doing zone two cardio for 30 to 60 minutes,
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.580]   three to four times a week,
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.700]   makes your blood sugar really stable.
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.440]   And that's an attractive thing for a variety of reasons.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.500]   On the flip side, high intensity interval training,
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.020]   or resistance training, aka weight training,
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.380]   are very good at stimulating the various molecules
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.900]   that promote repackaging of glycogen.
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.480]   So sprints, heavy weight lifting,
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.740]   circuit type weight lifting,
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.500]   provided there's some reasonable degree of resistance,
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.900]   those are going to trigger all sorts of mechanisms
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.620]   that are going to encourage the body
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.880]   to shuttle glucose back into glycogen,
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.580]   convert into glycogen into muscle tissue,
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.260]   restock the liver, et cetera.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.200]   And I should mention that one of the advantages
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.940]   of high intensity interval training
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.460]   or weightlifting of various kinds
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.680]   is that it also causes long standing increases
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.180]   in basal metabolic rate.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.520]   Now I'd like to turn to prescription drugs
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.960]   that regulate the hormone systems
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.420]   controlling feeding and satiety.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.020]   There's a prescription drug, Metformin,
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.500]   which was developed as a treatment for diabetes.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:07.240]   And it works potently to reduce blood glucose.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.340]   It has dramatic effects in lowering blood glucose.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.740]   Metformin involves changes
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.320]   to mitochondrial action in the liver.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:22.220]   That's its main way of depleting or reducing blood glucose.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:25.900]   And it does so through the so-called AMPK pathway,
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.620]   and it increases insulin sensitivity overall.
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.500]   Metformin is a powerful drug.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.260]   In fact, I'm surprised that so many people
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:38.220]   have sought it out given that most of the people
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.640]   that I'm aware of that sought it out are not diabetic.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.100]   I do want to mention,
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.380]   because I'm sure some of you out there
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.860]   are curious about the ketogenic diet.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:46.540]   I'm going to do an entire episode
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.220]   about ketosis and the brain and the body,
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:54.220]   but the ketogenic diet has been shown in 22 studies
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.340]   to have a notable decrease on blood glucose.
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.660]   And that is not surprising
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.240]   because the essence of the ketogenic diet
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.700]   is that you're consuming very little or zero
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:08.720]   of the foods that promote big spikes in insulin and glucose.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.920]   If you consume enough protein,
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.700]   some of that protein can be converted into glucose,
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.660]   of course, through gluconeogenesis.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.860]   But the ketogenic diet has very strong support
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:23.780]   for its role in regulating blood sugar, which is glucose.
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.980]   But the specific effects of the ketogenic diet,
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.900]   and one particular effect that I'll address later,
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.360]   but I'll mention now,
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.100]   which is the ability of the ketogenic diet
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.520]   to adjust thyroid hormone levels
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.060]   in ways that make it such
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.100]   that if you return to eating carbohydrates
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.300]   after being in ketosis for too long,
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.400]   you don't manage thyroid and carbohydrates as well.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.980]   That has been shown as well.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.780]   So we're going to dive deep into ketosis in a future episode.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.340]   So for you ketonistas out there, don't worry.
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.700]   I certainly have nothing against ketogenic diet.
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.860]   I actually don't have anything for or against
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.300]   any particular nutrition plan.
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.940]   I know what works for me, at least at this stage of my life,
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.500]   and I'll update it if I need to.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.440]   I'm simply trying to get you as much information
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.260]   as I possibly can so that you can navigate
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.860]   through that landscape in a way
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:13.020]   that's in keeping with your particular goals.
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.380]   So now you understand a lot about blood sugar
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.020]   and how it's managed and the ways that you can manage it
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.900]   better depending on your particular needs.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.360]   This is also a good opportunity for us to look back
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.500]   at some of the medical literature,
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.820]   because it really points to just how far we've come
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.500]   in terms of understanding these important mechanisms.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.460]   And it points us in the direction
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.940]   of some actionable protocols.
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:41.940]   So diabetes, which is these huge increases in blood glucose,
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.520]   because there's no insulin,
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.900]   was known about as early as 1500 BC,
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.740]   which is just incredible.
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:54.260]   And the way physicians then understood
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.440]   that certain people had high blood glucose
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.900]   without actually knowing what blood glucose was,
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.900]   is that they would take the urine of particular patients,
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:06.260]   and they'd find that ants preferably moved toward
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:10.820]   and consumed the urine of certain patients and not others.
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.820]   And they understood that there was something in that urine
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.940]   that was correlated with a sudden weight loss
[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.300]   and some of the other probably very unfortunate
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.700]   health symptoms that these people were experiencing.
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.320]   So they knew that there was something in blood and urine.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:30.320]   Now, this business of measuring blood sugar from the urine
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.980]   has been something that lasted way beyond
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.200]   these early stages of, you know, 1500 BC.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.860]   Turns out that as late as 1674,
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:44.100]   physicians at Oxford University were figuring out
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.980]   who had pathologically high levels of blood glucose
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.420]   by analyzing their urine.
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.180]   And again, they were measuring the sweetness
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.180]   of their urine, but, and this is medical fact,
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.060]   they would do this by taking urine samples
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.880]   from different patients and tasting them.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.060]   And they developed an intuitive sense
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:08.580]   of what excessively sweet urine was relative
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.300]   to the other urines that they had tasted.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.220]   So for those of you that are in the medical profession
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.940]   or those of you that are seeking out the medical profession,
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.640]   do understand this is not done anymore.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.920]   And you can also just reflect on how far we've come
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.320]   in terms of the medical profession itself,
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.380]   in our ability to measure things from the blood
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:29.520]   and measure things from urine without having to ask ants
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.520]   which urine is sweeter or ask oneself which urine is sweeter.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.700]   So indeed we are making progress as a species.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.920]   Before we close out today,
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.660]   I want to talk about one more tool
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.660]   that many of you will probably find useful.
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.180]   I certainly have.
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.400]   I'm a big consumer of caffeine,
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.460]   although I don't consume a ton of it,
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.980]   I consume it very consistently.
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.700]   So I'm big on consuming mate,
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.580]   which is a strong caffeinated tea.
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.400]   And I generally do that early in the day.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.700]   Although I do delay about two hours after I wake up
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.700]   for reasons I've talked about in previous episode
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.620]   to maintain that nice arc of alertness and focus.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.380]   Mate, also called yerba mate,
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:13.700]   is an interesting compound because unlike coffee,
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.060]   it has been shown to increase something
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:19.120]   called glucagon-like peptide, GLP-1,
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.860]   and increase leptin levels.
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.860]   Now, we didn't talk a lot about glucagon today.
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.820]   Glucagon is really elevated in the fasting state.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.820]   I mentioned that it's sort of the opposite of insulin
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.700]   in kind of rough terms.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.180]   That's one way to think about it.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:37.540]   But GLP-1 or glucagon-like peptide one
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.980]   is increased by ingesting mate
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:44.060]   and it acts as a pretty nice appetite suppressant.
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:46.360]   Now, I'm not trying to suppress my appetite.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.500]   I like to eat, as I mentioned before,
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:52.180]   but it works really well to stimulate the brain
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:55.360]   and to give you a level of alertness
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.420]   and to do a lot of the things that coffee does.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:59.220]   It also contains electrolytes.
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:03.660]   So we, meaning our neurons and our brain,
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.240]   run on a variety of factors,
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.540]   electrical activity and chemical transmission, et cetera,
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.620]   but they require adequate levels
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.060]   of sodium, potassium, and magnesium.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.060]   Actually, if you were to learn the biology
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.840]   or the physiology of the action potential,
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.180]   the firing of a neuron,
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.440]   something we teach every first-year neuroscience student,
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.620]   and I'd be happy to teach you if you're interested,
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.460]   you'll hear about sodium rushing into cells
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.620]   and potassium entering and leaving cells
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.980]   in order to allow neurons to communicate.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.580]   Electrolytes are critically important
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.740]   for the function of the nervous system.
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.700]   And many things that act as diuretics
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.480]   that promote excretion of water, like caffeine,
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.820]   can also take electrolytes out
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.640]   along with in particular sodium.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.040]   And sometimes the lightheadedness or the brain fog
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.640]   that people experience isn't just
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.800]   because electrolytes are low,
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.120]   but because they're kind of out of balance.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.320]   So I like mate because it has electrolytes, it has caffeine.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.700]   It stimulates the release
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.720]   of this glucagon-like peptide, GLP-1,
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.240]   and it's been a big help to me
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.920]   in extending that early morning fasting window
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.840]   out to about noon or so when I eat my first meal.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.260]   It also just tastes really good.
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.900]   And the fact that glucagon-like peptide one
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.980]   is enriched or is released more when you drink mate,
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.480]   and the fact that GLP-1 can regulate blood sugar
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.740]   in ways that keep your blood sugar
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.640]   in that we called euglycemic,
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.660]   not too high, not too low mode,
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:34.800]   is one reason why ingesting mate is attractive to me.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:39.360]   So Yerba Mate, GLP-1 can manage in healthy ways,
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.440]   leptin levels, glucose levels, and glucagon levels
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.800]   in ways that if it serves you, you might want to try.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.320]   So once again, we covered an enormous amount of material
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.400]   focused on how hormones regulate feeding, hunger,
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.360]   and when one feels they don't need to eat,
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.800]   so-called satiety, that you've had enough.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   We've just focused today mainly on things like ghrelin,
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.880]   on things like melanocyte-simulating hormone,
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:09.560]   incredible, powerful hormone that can suppress appetite,
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.160]   on things like cholecystokinin that comes from the gut
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:17.120]   and can suppress appetite, on things like food emulsifiers,
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.120]   on the fact that when you're eating,
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.320]   you are amino acid seeking,
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.000]   even though you might not realize it,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.160]   that you are also seeking out particular fatty acids.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.740]   So I've tried to give you a number of actionable tools.
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.800]   Again, always do what's best for your health
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.800]   and do that in company with a healthcare professional.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.080]   I'm not a physician, I don't prescribe anything.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.680]   I'm a professor, I profess a lot of things.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:41.080]   If you know anyone that's interested in this topic
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.160]   or you think that someone could benefit from it,
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.320]   please suggest the podcast to them as well,
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.120]   and most of all, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.700]   [upbeat music]
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:53.280]   (upbeat music)
